0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,263460,264180
0,"but anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty .

0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,294780,295500
0,{vocalsound},Marketing,295500,296220
0,"{vocalsound} So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is {disfmarker}",Project Manager,296220,305460
0,And furry .,User Interface,305460,306120
0,"yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .",Project Manager,306120,308940

0,"{gap} Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro .

0,Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ?,User Interface,342600,348420

0,"two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million .",Marketing,358560,362220
0,Two million .,Industrial Designer,362220,363000
0,Four million . And it {disfmarker},Marketing,363000,365040
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,365040,365760
0,"well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .",Marketing,365760,371040
0,"Oh , yeah .",Industrial Designer,371040,371700
0,{vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh .,Marketing,371700,373560
0,"So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .",Project Manager,373560,400260
0,"Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find",Marketing,400260,403620
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,403620,404340
0,I was thinking that too .,User Interface,404340,405840
0,bec yeah {vocalsound} bec,Marketing,405840,407340
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,407340,407700
0,"I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,",User Interface,407700,419400
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,419400,420120
0,"I've always wanted that ,",User Interface,420120,421620
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,421620,421980
0,so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker},User Interface,421980,426060
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .",Marketing,426060,427740
0,"I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,427740,432180
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .",User Interface,432180,439140
0,Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .,Marketing,439140,448440
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,448440,449160
0,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,449160,449940
0,In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker},Marketing,449940,455940
0,Yeah .,User Interface,455940,456300
0,I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker},Marketing,456300,459420
0,I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker},User Interface,459420,464040
0,Maybe call is enough . But yeah .,Marketing,464040,466020
0,"just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}",User Interface,466020,474120
0,Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah .,Marketing,474120,475500
0,"What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base ,",Project Manager,475500,487800
0,"Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah .",User Interface,487800,490680
0,like just to have a home for it .,Project Manager,490680,492660
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,492660,493380
0,Yeah yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,493380,494640
0,"Yeah ,",User Interface,494640,495000
0,"{vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,495000,504240
0,I mean {disfmarker},User Interface,504240,505380
0,{vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch .,Industrial Designer,505380,508680
0,Yeah .,User Interface,508680,509040

0,{vocalsound},Marketing,512400,513120
0,{gap},Project Manager,513120,513420
0,"I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker}",User Interface,513420,520620
0,Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . {vocalsound},Project Manager,520620,526440
0,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,526440,527940
0,Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls .,User Interface,527940,533040
0,"{vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive .",Marketing,533040,543360
0,Yeah .,User Interface,543360,543720
0,"But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .",Marketing,543720,547680
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,547680,548040
0,Yeah .,User Interface,548040,548400
0,Something like that .,Marketing,548400,549660
0,"Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?",Project Manager,549660,554280
0,And the other thing is {disfmarker},Marketing,554280,556380
0,Bigger .,User Interface,556380,556860
0,Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker},Marketing,556860,560280
0,"Like Hand hand held size , yeah .",Project Manager,560280,562260
0,Hand-sized .,User Interface,562260,562980
0,Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker},Marketing,562980,565620
0,"Not not huge , but {vocalsound}",Project Manager,565620,567480
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,567480,568200
0,But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .,Marketing,568200,571260
0,It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .,User Interface,571260,574680
0,"No , it can't be , uh-uh .",Marketing,574680,576240
0,No it really wouldn't be .,Industrial Designer,576240,577800
0,Huh .,Project Manager,577800,578100
0,Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound},User Interface,578100,581880
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,581880,582600
0,{vocalsound} Like spaceship .,Marketing,582600,584340

0,{vocalsound},Project Manager,591120,591840
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,591840,592560
0,That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .,User Interface,592560,597900
0,Little homing device . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um .,Project Manager,597900,601080
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,601080,601800
0,{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Uh .,User Interface,601800,604020
0,Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes .,Project Manager,604020,608880
0,Oh dear .,Marketing,608880,609420
0,"Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}",Project Manager,609420,614820
0,"I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,",User Interface,614820,618480
0,"Yeah , I agree .",Industrial Designer,618480,619440
0,'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker},User Interface,619440,623460
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,623460,623820
0,"{vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .",Industrial Designer,623820,627840
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah .",Marketing,627840,628920
0,"I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .",User Interface,628920,639120
0,"You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does .",Project Manager,639120,650280
0,That would be cool .,User Interface,650280,651480
0,Yeah .,Marketing,651480,651840
0,Yeah . I mean it just seems like {disfmarker},User Interface,651840,654540
0,"So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,654540,666180
0,yeah .,User Interface,666180,666540
0,what do you call it {disfmarker},Project Manager,666540,668460
0,Select . Uh .,Marketing,668460,669240
0,"s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s",Project Manager,669240,675660
0,"But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .",Marketing,675660,682020
0,That's something we could decide . Mm .,Project Manager,682020,684360
0,Because {disfmarker},Marketing,684360,685560
0,I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno .,User Interface,685560,688560
0,"Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,",Marketing,688560,705780
0,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager,705780,706560
0,and then use the telly as a screen .,Marketing,706560,708720
0,Right .,Project Manager,708720,709140
0,But um {disfmarker},Marketing,709140,710280
0,I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker},User Interface,710280,712260
0,"But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,",Marketing,712260,718740

0,Yeah .,Marketing,756780,757140
0,must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .,User Interface,757140,760020
0,Mm .,Project Manager,760020,760260
0,But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .,Marketing,760260,763560

0,Yeah .,Marketing,773580,773940
0,Mm .,User Interface,773940,774180

0,"Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .",User Interface,776880,780000
0,I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .,Project Manager,780000,782940

0,Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker},Marketing,783660,790020
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,790020,790380
0,"Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}",Marketing,790380,795780

0,"Yeah . Mm , mm .",User Interface,812400,813360
0,That's quite annoying .,Marketing,813360,814740
0,"Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}",Project Manager,814740,820800
0,Yeah .,User Interface,820800,821160
0,like that's another {disfmarker},Project Manager,821160,823080
0,"Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um .",Marketing,823080,825300
0,"Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ ,",Project Manager,825300,842160
0,Yeah I think so .,Industrial Designer,842160,843180
0,"yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ?",Project Manager,843180,855960
0,User .,Industrial Designer,855960,856320

0,"That's me . Uh , User Interface design .",User Interface,858540,860940
0,User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w,Project Manager,860940,872100
0,So technical function .,User Interface,872100,873480
0,The working design is the structure .,Industrial Designer,873480,875700
0,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,875700,876480
0,What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker},User Interface,876480,880920
0,"Um , I guess you'd have to find out {vocalsound} .",Project Manager,880920,883920

0,It was in the email .,Industrial Designer,887640,888900
0,It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker},User Interface,888900,892500
0,I wrote down what mine were .,Industrial Designer,892500,894240
0,It said um {disfmarker},Marketing,894240,895620
0,Yeah .,User Interface,895620,895980

0,Yeah,Marketing,901860,902100

0,"Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um .",Marketing,919740,922320
0,"So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker} Yeah .",Project Manager,922320,926460
0,Okay .,Marketing,926460,926820
0,So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . I just did .,Project Manager,926820,931560
1,That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button .,User Interface,0,4320
1,Like this one .,Industrial Designer,4320,5220
1,"But uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers .",User Interface,5220,16380
1,"It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that .",Industrial Designer,16380,39000
1,Okay .,Project Manager,39000,39360
1,"They n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them",Industrial Designer,39360,46860
1,"Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well ,",Project Manager,46860,53160
1,"Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,53160,55620
1,th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,55620,58200
1,"Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device .",Industrial Designer,58200,67440
1,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,67440,68580
1,It's it's quite easy .,Industrial Designer,68580,69900
1,"Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ?",Project Manager,69900,73020
1,"Yes , rubber ?",Industrial Designer,73020,73860
1,And the buttons ?,Project Manager,73860,74880
1,{vocalsound} Plastic or rubber .,User Interface,74880,76800
1,{vocalsound} There are plastic or rubber .,Industrial Designer,76800,79320
1,"Well ,",User Interface,79320,79680
1,"Okay ,",Project Manager,79680,80040
1,yeah .,User Interface,80040,80400
1,and uh the colouring ?,Project Manager,80400,81720
1,Uh yellow with uh,Industrial Designer,81720,82740
1,{gap} with with grey or black .,Project Manager,82740,84600
1,grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,84600,89880
1,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",Project Manager,89880,91020
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,91020,91740
1,we'll we'll come to that later . Um,Project Manager,91740,93840
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,93840,94560
1,okay . Anything else to add or {disfmarker},Project Manager,94560,97140
1,No . {vocalsound} Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons .,Industrial Designer,97140,101160
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,101160,101520
1,{vocalsound} But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,101520,103260
1,"Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button ,",Marketing,103260,108600
1,"Yes , but it {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,108600,110100
1,'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels .,Marketing,110100,114000
1,"but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .",Industrial Designer,114000,117540
1,M uh yeah .,Project Manager,117540,118200
1,Or not ?,Industrial Designer,118200,118680
1,"M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .",Project Manager,118680,126720
1,You {disfmarker},Marketing,126720,127680
1,"Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .",Industrial Designer,127680,131760
1,And a button for disabling the voice recognition .,User Interface,131760,134760
1,"Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker}",Project Manager,134760,145080
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,145080,145380
1,Yeah .,User Interface,145380,145740
1,"but o okay , that that's not really really important .",Project Manager,145740,148980
1,"{vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype .",User Interface,148980,152700
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,152700,153420
1,The basic {disfmarker} okay . Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?,Project Manager,153420,158580
1,Yes .,Marketing,158580,158880
1,Okay .,Project Manager,158880,159240
1,Uh my name is not name,Marketing,159240,160560
1,{vocalsound} You are nameless . {vocalsound},Project Manager,160560,163200
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,163200,163920
1,but {disfmarker},Marketing,163920,164880
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,164880,165600
1,"Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . And these uh were the most important criteria .",Marketing,165600,172320
1,{vocalsound} Is it spongy ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,172320,174720
1,"It should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah ,",Marketing,174720,177900
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,177900,178620
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,178620,179340
1,that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So {disfmarker},Marketing,179340,184260
1,"So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy . {vocalsound}",User Interface,184260,192300
1,Uh well appar,Marketing,192300,193080
1,I believe it's fancy too .,Industrial Designer,193080,194640
1,"Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet .",Marketing,194640,197760
1,No .,Project Manager,197760,198000
1,"Oh , sorry .",User Interface,198000,198720
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing,198720,199620
1,"Okay , so",Project Manager,199620,200160
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,200160,200520
1,this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria .,Project Manager,200520,203640
1,"Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .",Marketing,203640,206880
1,"Okay , well {disfmarker}",Project Manager,206880,208320
1,So uh,Marketing,208320,208620
1,the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,208620,212100
1,that's about it .,Marketing,212100,213120
1,The production costs . The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker},Project Manager,213120,220260
1,Twenty two .,User Interface,220260,220980
1,"Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty .",Project Manager,220980,225300
1,Yikes .,User Interface,225300,225720
1,"And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that ,",Project Manager,225720,231720
1,Well it's very expensive .,Industrial Designer,231720,233280
1,because it's not that important .,Project Manager,233280,235260
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,235260,235620
1,"Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa",User Interface,235620,238500
1,"Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .",Project Manager,238500,242340
1,yeah . The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,242340,244920
1,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,244920,246060
1,"Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would {disfmarker}",Project Manager,246060,251040
1,And and does it {disfmarker},User Interface,251040,252720
1,"if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,",Project Manager,252720,270420
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,270420,270900
1,because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .,Project Manager,270900,274440
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,274440,274920
1,"Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .",Project Manager,274920,289020
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,289020,289320
1,"So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .",Project Manager,289320,293820
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,293820,294180
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,294180,295080
1,"But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .",Industrial Designer,295080,303660
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,303660,304020
1,So it's c way too expensive .,Industrial Designer,304020,305760
1,"It's still too expensive , yeah . Um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,305760,308700
1,But that's that's only for the buttons .,User Interface,308700,311100
1,"I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,311100,315960
1,So the button we can use plastic .,User Interface,315960,318000
1,oh . {vocalsound},Project Manager,318000,319020
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,319020,319740
1,And uh maybe not use the special form .,Project Manager,319740,322080
1,"And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .",User Interface,322080,327840
1,But it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,327840,328980
1,"{vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .",Project Manager,328980,332640
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,332640,332940
1,But it's the board decision . Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,332940,337260
1,"Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .",Industrial Designer,337260,350940
1,"Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,350940,356820
1,So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment .,Industrial Designer,356820,360180
1,"Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic",Project Manager,360180,365220
1,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,365220,365580
1,and uh m maximise the profits,Project Manager,365580,367320
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,367320,367620
1,and um {disfmarker},Project Manager,367620,368760
1,That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,368760,372000
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,372000,372360
1,"Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,",Industrial Designer,372360,376500
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,376500,376860
1,but that's not what uh has been asked .,Industrial Designer,376860,379200
1,"I know , I know .",Project Manager,379200,380220
1,So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,380220,384780
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .",Project Manager,384780,396180
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,396180,396480
1,Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .,Project Manager,396480,402060
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,402060,402360
1,"Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative .",Project Manager,402360,409740
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,409740,410460
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,410460,411180
1,Or however you s pronounce that .,Project Manager,411180,413160
1,"Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound}",User Interface,413160,414900
1,"Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,",Project Manager,414900,417780
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,417780,418500
1,this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .,Project Manager,418500,426060
1,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,426060,426540
1,Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker},Project Manager,426540,437340
1,"Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Marketing,437340,442080
1,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager,442080,443220
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,443220,443940
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,443940,444660
1,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager,444660,445860
1,"Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .",Industrial Designer,445860,453180
1,We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .,Project Manager,453180,455760
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,455760,456660
1,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,456660,457680
1,Is it fancy ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,457680,459240
1,I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,459240,461700
1,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,461700,462600
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,462600,463320
1,Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?,Marketing,463320,464940
1,"Yeah , I think so .",Project Manager,464940,466080
1,"Um the yellow rubber , I think so .",User Interface,466080,468180
1,I think so .,Industrial Designer,468180,468900
1,"{vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,468900,472260
1,{vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound},User Interface,472260,474600
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,474600,475320
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,475320,476040
1,So uh one ?,Marketing,476040,476700
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,476700,477060
1,But it's not that fancy .,Industrial Designer,477060,478560
1,"No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .",Project Manager,478560,480660
1,I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . It would be even more {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,480660,490320
1,You like tita {vocalsound},Project Manager,490320,491880
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,491880,492600
1,"oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,492600,496320
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,496320,497040
1,That's a flavour as well .,Project Manager,497040,498600
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,498600,499320
1,"It has flavour . Yes , that's right . {vocalsound} You should taste it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,499320,504420
1,{vocalsound} Right . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,504420,506580
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,506580,507300
1,"Yeah , I know ,",Project Manager,507300,508200
1,Is it uh {disfmarker},Marketing,508200,509460
1,but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker},Project Manager,509460,516840
1,"It has to do with fashion , I guess .",Industrial Designer,516840,519060
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,519060,519420
1,"It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,519420,522420
1,So do {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,522420,523500
1,And w,Marketing,523500,523800
1,yeah .,User Interface,523800,524160
1,"yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials .",Marketing,524160,528900
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,528900,529260
1,So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy .,Marketing,529260,532620
1,It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,532620,534720
1,"Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two .",User Interface,534720,537120
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,537120,537480
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,537480,537840
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,537840,538140
1,"It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker}",User Interface,538140,541320
1,"I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .",Industrial Designer,541320,558000
1,"Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,558000,560640
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,560640,561540
1,"{vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two .",User Interface,561540,575700
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,575700,576000
1,"Yeah , I I agree .",Project Manager,576000,577080
1,"Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good .",Industrial Designer,577080,581700
1,"Okay , and uh was it innovative ?",Marketing,581700,583680
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,583680,584400
1,"Well ,",Project Manager,584400,584760
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,584760,585480
1,with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,585480,588720
1,But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker},User Interface,588720,591600
1,Yep .,Marketing,591600,591900
1,"No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .",Project Manager,591900,595800
1,"Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product .",Industrial Designer,595800,598560
1,Okay .,User Interface,598560,598920
1,So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .,Industrial Designer,598920,601800
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,601800,602160
1,"{vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think .",User Interface,602160,608460
1,"No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,608460,616200
1,"Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,616200,617760
1,That would have been a thrill .,Project Manager,617760,619620
1,"yes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,619620,620940
1,So uh also a uh two ?,Marketing,620940,622200
1,I think uh it's a two .,Industrial Designer,622200,623580
1,Yep .,Project Manager,623580,623880
1,Is it easy to use ?,Marketing,623880,625020
1,I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure .,Project Manager,625020,627540
1,Yeah .,User Interface,627540,627900
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,627900,628620
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,628620,629340
1,"Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .",User Interface,629340,639060
1,"{vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .",Industrial Designer,639060,648420
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,648420,648780
1,"That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,",Industrial Designer,648780,660540
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,660540,660900
1,and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .,Industrial Designer,660900,664560
1,I think {disfmarker} I think a three .,User Interface,664560,666840
1,So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,666840,671700
1,{vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .,User Interface,671700,673860
1,Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,673860,677640
1,"Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .",Marketing,677640,687360
1,Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .,Project Manager,687360,695640
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,695640,696000
1,It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?,Project Manager,696000,699540
1,"Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,",Industrial Designer,699540,708960
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,708960,709320
1,because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .,Industrial Designer,709320,713760
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,713760,714120
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,714120,715020
1,Um {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,715020,716340
1,"After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,716340,721200
1,"Uh Roo , a three ?",Project Manager,721200,722280
1,Yep .,User Interface,722280,722580
1,Ruud ?,Project Manager,722580,722940
1,Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .,Marketing,722940,725520
1,Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager,725520,726660
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,726660,727380
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,727380,728100
1,"So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .",Industrial Designer,728100,731700
1,So I could make it e easy ?,Project Manager,731700,733320
1,If you make it a four it will be three in general .,User Interface,733320,736380
1,"So that's w No , two and a half .",Industrial Designer,736380,738360
1,If he makes it a four . Not a three .,User Interface,738360,740580
1,Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,740580,745860
1,Darn . Nee .,User Interface,745860,746580
1,Yes . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,746580,747660
1,Hmm ? Huh ?,Marketing,747660,748320
1,Roo . {vocalsound},Project Manager,748320,749400
1,"A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .",User Interface,749400,752280
1,Yeah . I yeah {gap} .,Marketing,752280,753540
1,A four and a three together .,User Interface,753540,755280
1,{vocalsound} Four ?,Industrial Designer,755280,756420
1,"Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?",User Interface,756420,759180
1,"Yeah ,",Marketing,759180,759540
1,Two ?,Industrial Designer,759540,759840
1,"two , two , three {disfmarker}",Marketing,759840,761640
1,"No ,",Project Manager,761640,761880
1,And a three ?,User Interface,761880,762660
1,I haven't said anything yet .,Project Manager,762660,764400
1,Nee . I know .,User Interface,764400,765240
1,No . {vocalsound},Marketing,765240,766260
1,"Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .",Project Manager,766260,772560
1,Divided by four .,Industrial Designer,772560,773580
1,Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,773580,783540
1,But I'm filling in a three .,Project Manager,783540,785220
1,That's not even {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,785220,786900
1,Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .,Project Manager,786900,791160
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,791160,791880
1,"But that's not possible to fill in ,",Industrial Designer,791880,794040
1,"Yes , it is .",Project Manager,794040,794820
1,so we have to round it . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,794820,797040
1,{vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound},Marketing,797040,799800
1,"{vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .",Project Manager,799800,808800
1,"Yeah ,",User Interface,808800,809160
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,809160,809460
1,"we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .",User Interface,809460,815880
1,It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy .,Industrial Designer,815880,819120
1,"Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,819120,821400
1,"Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,821400,826320
1,Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,826320,829800
1,"I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,829800,831840
1,"something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .",Industrial Designer,831840,844860
1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager,844860,845640
1,But even without it {disfmarker},User Interface,845640,847560
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,847560,847920
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,847920,848640
1,"Well , I uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,848640,850080
1,"So , I th",Industrial Designer,850080,850620
1,"we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .",Project Manager,850620,856860
1,Yeah .,User Interface,856860,857220
1,Um Sebastian ?,Project Manager,857220,858060
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , me too .",Industrial Designer,858060,859740
1,Me too .,User Interface,859740,860220
1,"Yeah , I agree .",Marketing,860220,861180
1,"Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh",Project Manager,861180,865200
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,865200,865920
1,it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,865920,869160
1,"Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .",Industrial Designer,869160,877980
1,Was it one of our options ?,User Interface,877980,879600
1,"No , it's not one of our option ,",Industrial Designer,879600,881580
1,No . Uh,Marketing,881580,882000
1,"No okay , but but",Project Manager,882000,883020
1,"So , in the in {disfmarker}",User Interface,883020,884640
1,"but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,884640,888240
1,this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound},Marketing,888240,891180
1,"for the options given , it's the most spongy one .",Project Manager,891180,894180
1,"Uh yes ,",Industrial Designer,894180,894660
1,Yeah .,User Interface,894660,895020
1,"but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market .",Industrial Designer,895020,907260
1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager,907260,908040
1,So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,908040,914280
1,{vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound},Project Manager,914280,916980
1,{vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .,User Interface,916980,921840
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,921840,922560
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,922560,922920
1,"Yes , but it's not good enough ,",Industrial Designer,922920,924840
1,{vocalsound} I'll give it a one .,Project Manager,924840,926820
1,so it's a two .,Industrial Designer,926820,927720
1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one .,User Interface,927720,930540
1,You take one ? What do you give it ?,Industrial Designer,930540,932700
1,"Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker}",Marketing,932700,937140
1,"Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,937140,941280
1,but {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing,941280,942660
1,Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time .,Project Manager,942660,946740
1,"Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .",Marketing,946740,950640
1,It will be a one . {vocalsound},User Interface,950640,952500
1,So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .,Marketing,952500,956040
1,"No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,956040,961500
1,{vocalsound} You are {disfmarker},Project Manager,961500,963480
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,963480,964200
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,964200,964920
1,okay .,Project Manager,964920,965280
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,965280,966000
1,The remote control offers enough features .,Project Manager,966000,968580
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,968580,969300
1,"Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?",Project Manager,969300,972120
1,"Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker}",Marketing,972120,979500
1,{vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .,Industrial Designer,979500,982980
1,"Yeah , depends .",Marketing,982980,983940
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,983940,984300
1,You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .,Industrial Designer,984300,988980
1,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,988980,989880
1,So it's quite advanced .,Industrial Designer,989880,991320
1,What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,991320,994440
1,"Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .",User Interface,994440,1007820
1,I think it has .,Project Manager,1007820,1008780
1,Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat,Marketing,1008780,1012020
1,"Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,",Project Manager,1012020,1020900
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,1020900,1021200
1,"you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .",Project Manager,1021200,1032240
1,Has uh the signals sent to it .,Industrial Designer,1032240,1034100
1,Yeah .,User Interface,1034100,1034460
1,Signal .,Marketing,1034460,1034940
1,"So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .",Project Manager,1034940,1049220
1,Absolutely .,Industrial Designer,1049220,1049940
1,"Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .",Project Manager,1049940,1054560
1,"Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .",Industrial Designer,1054560,1065720
1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager,1065720,1066500
1,So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .,Industrial Designer,1066500,1071780
1,Yep .,Project Manager,1071780,1072080
1,You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1072080,1075740
1,"Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .",Project Manager,1075740,1084260
1,I'll give a two .,User Interface,1084260,1085280
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one .",Industrial Designer,1085280,1087680
1,"Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker}",Marketing,1087680,1095420
1,"Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .",Industrial Designer,1095420,1106160
1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,1106160,1107660
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,1107660,1108020
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1108020,1108920
1,"So high quality , low acceptance .",Project Manager,1108920,1110960
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1110960,1111260
1,"The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure .",Project Manager,1111260,1125540
1,Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1125540,1126920
1,D do you agree ?,Project Manager,1126920,1127880
1,"Yes , I agree . I {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1127880,1129680
1,Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .,Marketing,1129680,1132380
1,{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1132380,1137660
1,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,1137660,1138440
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,1138440,1139160
1,But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes .,Industrial Designer,1139160,1141260
1,But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?,User Interface,1141260,1146660
1,Twenty five Euros .,Project Manager,1146660,1147800
1,Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .,User Interface,1147800,1150560
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,1150560,1150920
1,"But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ?",User Interface,1150920,1160280
1,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1160280,1160760
1,So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1160760,1163940
1,M about fifty Euros .,Industrial Designer,1163940,1165200
1,yeah .,User Interface,1165200,1165560
1,That's quite ex,Industrial Designer,1165560,1166460
1,"That's price , but w w",User Interface,1166460,1167780
1,"well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .",Industrial Designer,1167780,1173480
1,"No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,1173480,1179900

1,So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1294440,1297560

2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,33240,33720
2,"So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a {disfmarker} leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries",Project Manager,33720,73260
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,73260,73620

2,Yep .,User Interface,87960,88260
2,Yes if you feel {disfmarker},Project Manager,88260,89940
2,Okay . We just connect up .,Marketing,89940,91560
2,{gap},Project Manager,91560,91860
2,"Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,",Marketing,91860,119520
2,{vocalsound},User Interface,119520,120240
2,It's okay {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,120240,121680
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,121680,122400
2,"sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .",Marketing,122400,191640
2,Yeah .,Project Manager,191640,192000
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .",Marketing,192000,233820
2,'Kay .,User Interface,233820,234180

2,That screwed in ? {gap},Industrial Designer,248520,249900
2,Okay .,Marketing,249900,250260
2,I hate those little things,Project Manager,250260,251820
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,251820,252180
2,especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .,Project Manager,252180,257700
2,{vocalsound} I know .,Marketing,257700,258960
2,"'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,258960,260460
2,Okay .,Project Manager,260460,260820
2,"Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .",Industrial Designer,260820,294720
2,'Kay . {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,294720,295980
2,"Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .",Industrial Designer,295980,314280
2,'Kay .,Project Manager,314280,314640
2,Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .,Industrial Designer,314640,317940
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,317940,318660
2,"There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,",Industrial Designer,318660,334320
2,Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?,Project Manager,334320,336600
2,people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .,Industrial Designer,336600,340560
2,"Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .",Project Manager,340560,342600
2,So you wind up your remote control before you use it .,Industrial Designer,342600,345840
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,345840,346560
2,"How {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what kind of {disfmarker} how l long can you get out of that ,",Project Manager,346560,352080
2,It might {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,352080,353340
2,I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or {disfmarker},Project Manager,353340,359880
2,"You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,359880,380100
2,That doesn't count though does it ?,Project Manager,380100,382200
2,Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?,Marketing,382200,384840
2,I thought it was U_V_ like {disfmarker},Project Manager,384840,387180
2,No .,Industrial Designer,387180,387420
2,Artificial light ?,Marketing,387420,388500
2,Is it ? Alright i,Industrial Designer,388500,389520
2,"Any , any {disfmarker}",Project Manager,389520,390840
2,Has to be solar .,Marketing,390840,391860
2,"Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or {disfmarker} and dynamo might take more space .",User Interface,391860,405420
2,Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .,Industrial Designer,405420,412680
2,I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .,Project Manager,412680,415320
2,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,415320,416100
2,"Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights",Project Manager,416100,418740
2,"Mm . Artificial light , no .",Marketing,418740,420420
2,"no , but I mean not many {disfmarker} you don't want to limit your market .",Project Manager,420420,424920
2,That's going to {disfmarker},Marketing,424920,426600
2,"I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .",Project Manager,426600,432240
2,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,432240,433140
2,"I know ,",Marketing,433140,433620
2,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,433620,434580
2,"different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .",Marketing,434580,439380
2,Yeah,Industrial Designer,439380,439620
2,Right .,User Interface,439620,440040
2,and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .,Industrial Designer,440040,444360
2,Night .,User Interface,444360,444780
2,"Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .",Project Manager,444780,454020
2,But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .,Industrial Designer,454020,457500
2,Okay .,Project Manager,457500,457860
2,The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches,Industrial Designer,457860,462780
2,Yeah I've seen {disfmarker},Project Manager,462780,464400
2,"and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .",Industrial Designer,464400,478620
2,"And are these like uh {disfmarker} what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?",User Interface,478620,485160
2,"Um yeah it's {disfmarker} it charges into um some form of {disfmarker} it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,",Industrial Designer,485160,495300
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,495300,495780
2,'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .,Industrial Designer,495780,498780
2,Okay .,User Interface,498780,499140
2,And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out {gap} .,Industrial Designer,499140,507600
2,We c,User Interface,507600,507840
2,"But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time",Project Manager,507840,514740
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,514740,515100
2,"so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd {disfmarker}",Project Manager,515100,521280
2,Yeah and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,521280,522540
2,"I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .",Project Manager,522540,530220
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,530220,530700
2,Yeah but then again,Industrial Designer,530700,531840
2,Is it really gonna be enough ?,Project Manager,531840,533640
2,"I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .",Industrial Designer,533640,547020
2,Okay .,Project Manager,547020,547380
2,"And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it",Industrial Designer,547380,556680
2,So it's not {disfmarker} the draw on it isn't {disfmarker},Project Manager,556680,560160
2,and you put it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,560160,561780
2,Hmm .,Marketing,561780,562080
2,no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,562080,565980
2,Mm-hmm . Mm .,Marketing,565980,566760
2,Okay .,Project Manager,566760,567120
2,"Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?",Marketing,567120,573840
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,573840,574080
2,"I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging",Marketing,574080,581520
2,Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing,Industrial Designer,581520,585360
2,or the two things not compatible ?,Marketing,585360,587400
2,Like a dual kind of .,Project Manager,587400,588660
2,"but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .",Industrial Designer,588660,602700
2,Mm . So that affects the exterior design .,Marketing,602700,605220
2,Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .,User Interface,605220,607740
2,Expensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for {disfmarker},Project Manager,607740,612120
2,"They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,612120,615180
2,It's twelve point f,User Interface,615180,616320
2,I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?,Project Manager,616320,619260
2,"Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the {disfmarker} It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,",Industrial Designer,619260,630960
2,Solar .,Project Manager,630960,631380
2,'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y,Industrial Designer,631380,635160
2,Well they're not designed {disfmarker},Project Manager,635160,637440
2,"the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .",Industrial Designer,637440,645600
2,Practical-wise okay .,Project Manager,645600,646860
2,"Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,",Industrial Designer,646860,655020
2,You do get a bit of wear,Project Manager,655020,656460
2,they can t,Industrial Designer,656460,657060
2,but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?,Project Manager,657060,660300
2,"Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .",Industrial Designer,660300,667740
2,Mm .,Project Manager,667740,667980
2,Mm .,Marketing,667980,668220
2,Another question is like {disfmarker},User Interface,668220,670440
2,Again it de,Marketing,670440,671100
2,"sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .",User Interface,671100,679440
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,679440,679680
2,"A remote control , like ,",User Interface,679680,681180
2,W m yeah,Industrial Designer,681180,681660
2,so we have to s look at the life also .,User Interface,681660,684000
2,Mm .,Marketing,684000,684240
2,"so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .",Industrial Designer,684240,702060
2,"It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,",Marketing,702060,706560
2,"Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .",Industrial Designer,706560,708960
2,"i {vocalsound} it's not gonna add anything , okay .",Marketing,708960,712020
2,"Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?",Project Manager,712020,715500
2,Okay .,User Interface,715500,715860
2,Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,715860,721080
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,721080,721440
2,Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker},Marketing,721440,727800
2,Well add it in to think about um,Project Manager,727800,729720
2,"right , okay .",Marketing,729720,730560
2,"because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,730560,741240
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,741240,741600
2,"we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .",Project Manager,741600,752760
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,752760,753120
2,But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than,Project Manager,753120,758160
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,758160,758520
2,the eternal battle for control of the controls .,Project Manager,758520,761400
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,761400,762120
2,"It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,",Marketing,762120,767220
2,No .,Project Manager,767220,767460
2,it's not a thing that people are looking for,Marketing,767460,770100
2,Okay .,Project Manager,770100,770460
2,So {disfmarker},User Interface,770460,771360
2,when we threw it open to the field yeah .,Marketing,771360,773820
2,Okay .,Industrial Designer,773820,774180
2,But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .,Marketing,774180,777780
2,"Okay , right .",Project Manager,777780,778620
2,"Okay , well I'll move on .",Industrial Designer,778620,780180
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,780180,780660
2,"Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .",Industrial Designer,780660,812460
2,"What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,812460,824160
2,"Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,",Industrial Designer,824160,850980
2,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Project Manager,850980,851880
2,"if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit",Industrial Designer,851880,862740
2,Okay .,Project Manager,862740,863100
2,"so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,",Industrial Designer,863100,888660
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,888660,889140
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,889140,889620
2,"but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .",Industrial Designer,889620,901080
2,Okay .,User Interface,901080,901440
2,"Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing",Industrial Designer,901440,913620
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,913620,914100
2,"and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,",Industrial Designer,914100,923880
2,Mm .,Project Manager,923880,924120
2,"which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,",Industrial Designer,924120,933600
2,Mm .,Marketing,933600,933840
2,"but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer,933840,946020
2,Okay .,Marketing,946020,946380
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,946380,946860
2,"I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units",Industrial Designer,946860,980940
2,Second thing is {disfmarker},User Interface,980940,982620
2,"Hinged , yeah .",Project Manager,982620,983520
2,for the flip phone .,Industrial Designer,983520,984720
2,"yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .",User Interface,984720,990900
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,990900,991260
2,"So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .",User Interface,991260,999900
2,Mm .,Marketing,999900,1000140
2,"So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,",User Interface,1000140,1003140
2,Yeah I th,Industrial Designer,1003140,1003680
2,or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker},User Interface,1003680,1006860
2,"Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1006860,1013400
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1013400,1013880
2,"it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1013880,1024800
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1024800,1025280
2,it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .,Industrial Designer,1025280,1031400
2,It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .,Marketing,1031400,1040100
2,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1040100,1040880
2,"I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,",Marketing,1040880,1047360
2,"Rubber , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1047360,1048260
2,"that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .",Marketing,1048260,1054440
2,And you can peel them off yeah .,Industrial Designer,1054440,1056360
2,Yeah .,User Interface,1056360,1056720
2,"So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,",Project Manager,1056720,1062900
2,"Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .",Marketing,1062900,1065060
2,Something like {disfmarker},User Interface,1065060,1066680
2,"like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .",Project Manager,1066680,1071540
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1071540,1071900
2,Alright .,User Interface,1071900,1072440
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1072440,1072800
2,Mm .,Marketing,1072800,1073040
2,That could be a good idea .,User Interface,1073040,1074660
2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1074660,1074960
2,Mm .,Marketing,1074960,1075200
2,It could {disfmarker} it would be comfortable to hold on also .,User Interface,1075200,1078980
2,Okay . Mm .,Project Manager,1078980,1079640
2,T,Industrial Designer,1079640,1079700
2,Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .,Marketing,1079700,1085280
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1085280,1085640
2,Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .,Project Manager,1085640,1090140
2,Mm . Yeah .,Marketing,1090140,1090800
2,Also the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1090800,1092060
2,'Kay .,Project Manager,1092060,1092420
2,"just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the {disfmarker} I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .",Industrial Designer,1092420,1100700
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1100700,1101180
2,"Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch",Industrial Designer,1101180,1140840
2,"Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}",User Interface,1140840,1144740
2,display . Uh what what {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1144740,1146840
2,"Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}",User Interface,1146840,1152780
2,Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1152780,1158120
2,Uh-huh .,User Interface,1158120,1158600
2,"the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,",Industrial Designer,1158600,1165680
2,Okay .,User Interface,1165680,1166040
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1166040,1166520
2,"but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .",Industrial Designer,1166520,1179240
2,Mm .,Marketing,1179240,1179480
2,With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1179480,1182240
2,"I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}",Marketing,1182240,1191480
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1191480,1191840
2,Oh it would be flat inside .,Project Manager,1191840,1193520
2,"You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,",Industrial Designer,1193520,1196160
2,"yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .",Marketing,1196160,1198140
2,Mm .,Project Manager,1198140,1198380
2,but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .,Industrial Designer,1198380,1202220
2,Have I misunderstood you ?,Marketing,1202220,1203780
2,"It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,",Industrial Designer,1203780,1207860
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1207860,1208340
2,"but there'd be touch touch buttons ,",Industrial Designer,1208340,1210500
2,'Kay .,User Interface,1210500,1210860
2,"so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer,1210860,1218660
2,"I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .",Project Manager,1218660,1229460
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1229460,1229940
2,Is rubber . Mm .,Industrial Designer,1229940,1230900
2,Yeah .,Marketing,1230900,1231260
2,"Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1231260,1238640
2,Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .,Industrial Designer,1238640,1242240
2,Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,1242240,1243920
2,"I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .",Marketing,1243920,1261740
2,"Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out",Industrial Designer,1261740,1266240
2,Like one of the palm pop thing .,Project Manager,1266240,1268160
2,"but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,",Industrial Designer,1268160,1271040
2,Mm .,Marketing,1271040,1271280
2,"Absolutely , f for somebody who {gap} very often , if he would {disfmarker}",User Interface,1271280,1275780
2,'cause I had {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1275780,1277280
2,Yeah .,Marketing,1277280,1277640
2,It would have to be attached .,Project Manager,1277640,1279440
2,"They're easy to replace as well , cheap .",Marketing,1279440,1281900
2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1281900,1282200
2,a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a {gap},User Interface,1282200,1290000
2,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1290000,1290780
2,"and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .",User Interface,1290780,1298040
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1298040,1298520
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1298520,1298880
2,Mm .,Marketing,1298880,1299120
2,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,1299120,1299780
2,"Yeah just a thought {disfmarker} they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a {disfmarker}",Marketing,1299780,1310940
2,"Okay , we'll talk about that {disfmarker} so if you finish your {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1310940,1315500
2,Yeah that's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1315500,1316940
2,and we'll come back to that .,Project Manager,1316940,1318680
2,yeah that {disfmarker} that's the end of m my {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1318680,1322160
2,"That's you , right okay .",Project Manager,1322160,1323660
2,"And just one small question before like you are {gap} , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons",User Interface,1323660,1334460
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1334460,1334820
2,"like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .",User Interface,1334820,1343460
2,"Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,",Industrial Designer,1343460,1346700
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1346700,1347180
2,"I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate {disfmarker} you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,",Industrial Designer,1347180,1356960
2,Okay . Okay .,User Interface,1356960,1357740
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1357740,1358220
2,'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .,Industrial Designer,1358220,1361940
2,"I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .",Marketing,1361940,1370280
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1370280,1370520
2,"If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?",Marketing,1370520,1381860
2,No .,Project Manager,1381860,1382100
2,And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display {disfmarker} th uh the remote control display thing .,Marketing,1382100,1397100
2,We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .,Project Manager,1397100,1400220
2,Um .,Industrial Designer,1400220,1400460
2,They don't look at themselves ? Just a thought .,Marketing,1400460,1403340
2,"Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager,1403340,1415580

2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1420800,1421520
2,"it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .",Marketing,1421520,1427340
2,"Yeah , no , no .",Project Manager,1427340,1428300
2,{gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much,Marketing,1428300,1433280
2,Mm .,Project Manager,1433280,1433520
2,but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .,Marketing,1433520,1436520
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1436520,1436880
2,Okay .,Project Manager,1436880,1437240
2,'Kay .,Marketing,1437240,1437600
2,"I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,",Industrial Designer,1437600,1448340
2,Mm .,Marketing,1448340,1448580
2,"but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1448580,1454040
2,Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror,Marketing,1454040,1456440
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , okay .",Project Manager,1456440,1458000
2,that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .,Marketing,1458000,1461720
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1461720,1462440
2,"Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .",User Interface,1462440,1493160
2,Mm .,Project Manager,1493160,1493400
2,"So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .",User Interface,1493400,1498140
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1498140,1498500
2,And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .,User Interface,1498500,1504140
2,Mm .,Project Manager,1504140,1504380
2,"Like , some some people have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Here you see this ? This is on a {disfmarker} I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .",User Interface,1504380,1522980
2,Okay .,Project Manager,1522980,1523340

2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1531920,1532280
2,and g graphic user interface,User Interface,1532280,1533960
2,Sorry what does that stand for ?,Marketing,1533960,1535880
2,Which means {disfmarker},Project Manager,1535880,1537320
2,"basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,",User Interface,1537320,1542300
2,Okay .,Marketing,1542300,1542660
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1542660,1543020
2,which is {disfmarker},User Interface,1543020,1544280
2,If you if {disfmarker} yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .,Industrial Designer,1544280,1550400
2,Like you have on a l uh {disfmarker} icons or something y you have {disfmarker} is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .,User Interface,1550400,1558320
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1558320,1558680
2,Okay .,Project Manager,1558680,1559040
2,"So basically {gap} not point or click {gap} {disfmarker} Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .",User Interface,1559040,1567740
2,Okay .,Project Manager,1567740,1568100
2,"And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .",User Interface,1568100,1582560
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1582560,1583040
2,"So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .",User Interface,1583040,1592940

2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1605420,1605780
2,"No you'd hold it {disfmarker} you don't {disfmarker} if you flip it open then you'd be {disfmarker} Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah .",Marketing,1605780,1625640

2,"and then be able to touch that for the {vocalsound} other controls ,",Project Manager,1635420,1639500
2,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1639500,1640520
2,Okay and you mean to the {disfmarker},User Interface,1640520,1642740
2,"so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that ,",Project Manager,1642740,1646580
2,And the lower distance .,User Interface,1646580,1648020
2,on the lower side .,Project Manager,1648020,1649160

2,"So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .",User Interface,1687500,1692180
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1692180,1692540
2,Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound,User Interface,1692540,1696620
2,Mm .,Marketing,1696620,1696860
2,and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh {disfmarker} you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also .,User Interface,1696860,1704660
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1704660,1705020
2,"So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . My personal preferences would be like , as already {gap} uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh",User Interface,1705020,1725720
2,Mm .,Marketing,1725720,1725960
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1725960,1726320
2,"tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh",User Interface,1726320,1734840
2,"Well , yeah we {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1734840,1736460
2,"I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern",User Interface,1736460,1745340
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1745340,1745700
2,because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .,User Interface,1745700,1749780
2,"I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ?",Project Manager,1749780,1752960
2,"This is central one , the one you {disfmarker}",User Interface,1752960,1755720
2,Or is that volume and channel ?,Project Manager,1755720,1757580
2,"yeah volume and channel . So keep that m {disfmarker} that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . This and voice recognition .",User Interface,1757580,1769760
2,"Okay . Right . Okay . Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on {disfmarker} Do we agree on the battery ?",Project Manager,1769760,1781220
2,The kinetic .,User Interface,1781220,1782000
2,Kinetic ?,Marketing,1782000,1782540
2,Yeah .,Project Manager,1782540,1782900
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1782900,1783260
2,"Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1783260,1791360
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1791360,1791600
2,so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .,Project Manager,1791600,1795320
2,Yeah I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1795320,1796820
2,"It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a",Project Manager,1796820,1799700
2,I mean if {disfmarker} Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have,Industrial Designer,1799700,1804320
2,selling point .,Project Manager,1804320,1805220
2,"and also if they've got it {disfmarker} if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them ,",Industrial Designer,1805220,1813200
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1813200,1813680
2,"uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .",Industrial Designer,1813680,1823760
2,I think the only,Project Manager,1823760,1824720
2,Mm .,Marketing,1824720,1824960
2,"I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,",Project Manager,1824960,1832820
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1832820,1833180
2,but I think pretty much we've used cheap {disfmarker} relatively cheap and simple things .,Project Manager,1833180,1838580
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1838580,1838940
2,Mm .,Marketing,1838940,1839180
2,The L_C_D_'s not cheap .,Project Manager,1839180,1840620

2,Hmm .,Marketing,1848420,1848720
2,I mean they use them in calculators so .,Industrial Designer,1848720,1851120
2,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,1851120,1851900
2,Maybe we could start with the black and white .,User Interface,1851900,1854720
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1854720,1855080
2,That that way we could upgrade later {gap} .,User Interface,1855080,1857720

2,"Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,",Marketing,1860120,1862580
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1862580,1863300

2,Well you cou um .,Industrial Designer,1869360,1870380
2,Do you want like a back-up ?,Project Manager,1870380,1872060
2,"No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?",Marketing,1872060,1881360
2,K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch {disfmarker} a battery that goes in a watch .,Industrial Designer,1881360,1887540
2,"I oh I see . Right , okay , got you .",Marketing,1887540,1889760
2,"So it's a lot smaller , so it would {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1889760,1892640
2,"Got you on that okay , didn't realise .",Marketing,1892640,1894980
2,"Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?",Project Manager,1894980,1901280
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1901280,1901640
2,Yeah .,User Interface,1901640,1902000

2,"Plastic ,",Industrial Designer,1952880,1953420
2,"we could use the body ,",User Interface,1953420,1954800
2,For the inside .,Project Manager,1954800,1955760
2,okay .,Industrial Designer,1955760,1956120
2,"for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .",User Interface,1956120,1961940

2,"Mm-hmm ,",Marketing,1962780,1963260
2,{gap},User Interface,1963260,1963560

2,Plast right .,User Interface,1968300,1969080
2,"{vocalsound} Oh I think so , I think so .",Project Manager,1969080,1971540
2,"okay . and it is just uh {disfmarker} although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,",Marketing,1971540,1988160
2,Mm no .,Industrial Designer,1988160,1988580
2,No I think I {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Project Manager,1988580,1990860
2,just go for the colours .,Marketing,1990860,1992360
2,It's {disfmarker},User Interface,1992360,1993380
2,we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway,Project Manager,1993380,1997520
2,Okay .,Marketing,1997520,1997880
2,"um the fact {disfmarker} the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes ,",Project Manager,1997880,2010060
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,2010060,2010540

2,The feel .,Marketing,2016540,2017140
2,yes . So we could just pick anything .,Project Manager,2017140,2019420

2,is that fancy {gap} ?,Marketing,2043000,2044260

2,Mm .,Marketing,2050320,2050560
2,sort of beige and black,Project Manager,2050560,2051940
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,2051940,2052420
2,"um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway ,",Project Manager,2052420,2057940
2,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing,2057940,2058960
2,or you want something that contrasts as {vocalsound} you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and {disfmarker},Project Manager,2058960,2070180
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,2070180,2070420
2,"Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things .",Marketing,2070420,2084160

2,"Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming {disfmarker} I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,",Marketing,2105040,2121600

2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,2121840,2122560

2,"y you know , you could just go so far with it ,",Project Manager,2128140,2130960
2,You can you can just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,2130960,2132940
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,2132940,2133660

2,"Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also",User Interface,2202420,2205480

2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,2211360,2211840
2,"So , are we looking at voice {gap} ?",User Interface,2211840,2214000
2,"Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,",Marketing,2214000,2220960

2,"Well they do ,",Project Manager,2258640,2259480
2,don't they ?,Marketing,2259480,2260200
2,but I think we can {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,2260200,2264220
2,Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .,Marketing,2264220,2269020

2,Yeah .,Marketing,2273340,2273700
2,"Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is",Project Manager,2273700,2277660

2,Okay .,Marketing,2279940,2280300

4,Just {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,90780,92220
4,"And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um {disfmarker} Should be a univ uh universal remote control {disfmarker} No , that's {disfmarker} I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So have you changed that part ?",Project Manager,92220,113760
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,113760,114480
4,Okay .,User Interface,114480,114840
4,Okay . {vocalsound},Marketing,114840,115980
4,"Um so {disfmarker} yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .",Project Manager,115980,143520
4,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,143520,144300
4,"Uh so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,144300,150900
4,Which one first ?,User Interface,150900,151920
4,Okay .,Marketing,151920,152280
4,"Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,152280,155580
4,Okay .,User Interface,155580,155940
4,Mm . Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,155940,157140
4,"Functional requirements , yeah",User Interface,157140,158940
4,"Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .",Marketing,158940,173160
4,"I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me ,",Project Manager,173160,176040
4,You didn't read it ?,Marketing,176040,177240
4,I didn't get it uh anyway .,Project Manager,177240,178860
4,"No , I didn don't thing we got it .",User Interface,178860,180960
4,It's only for you .,Project Manager,180960,182100
4,"Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it .",Marketing,182100,184680
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,184680,185040
4,Yes .,User Interface,185040,185340
4,"Okay it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements .",Marketing,185340,249300
4,The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,249300,253140
4,"Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .",Marketing,253140,257640
4,So,Project Manager,257640,257760
4,Um Martijn alr already said it .,Marketing,257760,259680
4,if we {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,259680,261180
4,"And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but {disfmarker} I don't think it's uh",Marketing,261180,266820
4,"Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,",Project Manager,266820,270240
4,reachable .,Marketing,270240,270900
4,then you're you're {disfmarker},Project Manager,270900,272760
4,"Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .",Marketing,272760,275280
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,275280,275640
4,"That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly .",Marketing,275640,297780
4,Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .,User Interface,297780,304920
4,"Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't {disfmarker} We we haven't {disfmarker} Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page .",Marketing,304920,342720
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,342720,343440
4,"Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money . {vocalsound} But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . {gap}",Marketing,343440,379200
4,So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .,Project Manager,379200,381720
4,But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?,Marketing,381720,387180
4,"People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,",Project Manager,387180,391680
4,"I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,",Marketing,391680,396000
4,Yeah .,User Interface,396000,396360
4,because {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,396360,397980
4,because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .,Marketing,397980,400980
4,It's too {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,400980,402660
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,402660,403020
4,"Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .",Marketing,403020,429120
4,"Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .",Project Manager,429120,431880
4,"Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .",Marketing,431880,445140
4,"Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .",User Interface,445140,447960
4,"Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product . We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah . One of a kind , I think .",Marketing,447960,470220
4,"So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,",Project Manager,470220,472320
4,Unique .,User Interface,472320,472800
4,"{vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .",Marketing,472800,477840
4,but {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,477840,479220
4,"Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker}",User Interface,479220,480900
4,But old people are not looking for that .,Project Manager,480900,483360
4,Uh I think mm {disfmarker},User Interface,483360,484920
4,Not really .,Project Manager,484920,485640
4,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,485640,486540
4,"Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .",Industrial Designer,486540,492480
4,Yeah .,User Interface,492480,492840
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing,492840,493200
4,Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager,493200,493980
4,to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker},Marketing,493980,496620
4,"But uh we also have to stand out ,",User Interface,496620,498660
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,498660,499020
4,"Sorry I thought about it , yes .",Marketing,499020,500940
4,"'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape ,",User Interface,500940,515220
4,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager,515220,516000
4,so {disfmarker},User Interface,516000,516900
4,"Okay , this was uh my presentation .",Marketing,516900,519060
4,Thanks .,Project Manager,519060,519540
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,519540,519900
4,I don't {disfmarker},Marketing,519900,521100
4,So,Project Manager,521100,521220
4,Yeah .,Marketing,521220,521580
4,"Paul , you can do the next one if you want .",Project Manager,521580,524220
4,You can ask some questions or something .,Marketing,524220,526680
4,Okay . Yeah well {disfmarker} Uh .,User Interface,526680,528720
4,"It's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,",Project Manager,528720,531120
4,There it is .,User Interface,531120,531900
4,isn't it ?,Project Manager,531900,532500
4,"Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .",User Interface,532500,556500
4,So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker},Project Manager,556500,561180
4,"Yeah , I have it on the next page .",User Interface,561180,563280
4,Okay .,Project Manager,563280,563640
4,"But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control",User Interface,563640,595680
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,595680,596040
4,"to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh {disfmarker} Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .",User Interface,596040,617400
4,Okay .,Project Manager,617400,617760
4,"But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker}",User Interface,617760,624240
4,"Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ?",Industrial Designer,624240,631500
4,"Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,",Project Manager,631500,633660
4,No y,User Interface,633660,633900
4,but not sure {gap} .,Project Manager,633900,635100
4,Well,User Interface,635100,635340
4,"It's a good idea , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,635340,637440
4,"it's {disfmarker} It was just a thought . So I'm , I u {disfmarker} I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .",User Interface,637440,647100
4,"Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?",Industrial Designer,647100,652860
4,Well uh,User Interface,652860,653280
4,Uh {gap} {disfmarker},Project Manager,653280,654540
4,"what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six .",User Interface,654540,662940
4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,662940,663300
4,"So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the {disfmarker}",User Interface,663300,672240
4,"Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .",Industrial Designer,672240,678120
4,Well if you said a favourite {disfmarker},User Interface,678120,680580
4,"Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,680580,685020

4,"Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,783720,790620
4,A ten plus or {disfmarker},Project Manager,790620,792180
4,"Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .",User Interface,792180,797280
4,Okay .,Project Manager,797280,797640
4,To just keep it simple and standard uh features .,User Interface,797640,800580
4,"Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,800580,808320
4,Uh yeah mayb,User Interface,808320,809040
4,It gets some seconds .,Marketing,809040,810360
4,But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .,User Interface,810360,819300
4,Oh okay . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,819300,820260
4,"Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}",Marketing,820260,822840
4,So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .,User Interface,822840,827040
4,"Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,827040,829200
4,It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .,Marketing,829200,842100
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,842100,842460
4,"So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .",User Interface,842460,847980
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,847980,848340
4,"So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that {disfmarker} And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and {disfmarker}",User Interface,848340,858840
4,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,858840,859620
4,But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f,Project Manager,859620,864840
4,It's only for television now .,Marketing,864840,866640
4,So I I don't think so .,User Interface,866640,868020
4,No .,Project Manager,868020,868260
4,Uh I just thought of another one .,User Interface,868260,870300
4,No .,Marketing,870300,870540
4,Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .,User Interface,870540,873540
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,873540,873900
4,"So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker} But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,",User Interface,873900,881880
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,881880,882240
4,so you have,User Interface,882240,882900
4,"I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .",Industrial Designer,882900,893520
4,four arrows .,User Interface,893520,894300
4,Because you n almost never use menu button .,Industrial Designer,894300,896940
4,"Yeah , okay ,",User Interface,896940,897720
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,897720,898620
4,but um {disfmarker},User Interface,898620,899760
4,"Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to {disfmarker}",Project Manager,899760,906240
4,"Yeah , a mute button . Yes .",User Interface,906240,907920
4,"Maybe , not {disfmarker}",Project Manager,907920,909360
4,Don't think so .,User Interface,909360,910320
4,I don't know where where you have to put it .,Project Manager,910320,913020
4,"Yeah well ,",User Interface,913020,913680
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,913680,914400
4,that's that's {disfmarker} I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use .,User Interface,914400,922920
4,Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .,Project Manager,922920,925020
4,And later we can d uh do the design .,User Interface,925020,927240
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,927240,927600
4,"Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .",User Interface,927600,950880
4,Yeah . Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours,Project Manager,950880,955680
4,Um {disfmarker} I dunno . Different colours um {disfmarker},User Interface,955680,959220
4,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,959220,960120
4,Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow,Marketing,960120,964740
4,It's like a iMac or something .,Project Manager,964740,966600
4,or {disfmarker},Marketing,966600,967500
4,{vocalsound} Just to make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,967500,970740
4,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,970740,971220
4,Yeah . Well why not ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface,971220,973860
4,That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .,Marketing,973860,976500
4,"But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it {disfmarker}",Project Manager,976500,984600
4,"Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .",User Interface,984600,987420
4,"Oh , you just {disfmarker} I dunno what happened .",Project Manager,987420,990420
4,Oh .,User Interface,990420,990660
4,{gap},Marketing,990660,990960
4,Who ?,User Interface,990960,991260
4,"Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just {disfmarker}",Project Manager,991260,995700
4,They they're uh designed very well .,User Interface,995700,997860
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,997860,998220
4,"And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .",User Interface,998220,1007640
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1007640,1008000
4,"But uh well , I think that's a good example .",User Interface,1008000,1010700
4,"Okay , {gap}",Project Manager,1010700,1011420
4,Okay .,Marketing,1011420,1011780

4,"Okay , sorry .",User Interface,1015140,1015980
4,Is it fin Are you finished ?,Project Manager,1015980,1017660
4,Well uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1017660,1018860
4,Okay .,Project Manager,1018860,1019220
4,"Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .",User Interface,1019220,1022640
4,"Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .",Industrial Designer,1022640,1077480
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1077480,1077960
4,Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things,Industrial Designer,1077960,1082340
4,So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?,Project Manager,1082340,1085520
4,but {disfmarker} Yeah . I I think so . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1085520,1088580
4,Uh j Is {disfmarker},User Interface,1088580,1089780
4,I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .,Industrial Designer,1089780,1092120
4,"Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable .",Project Manager,1092120,1094880
4,Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?,User Interface,1094880,1098060
4,"Yeah , that's active .",Marketing,1098060,1099380
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1099380,1099740
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1099740,1100100
4,"Or just a green one ,",Project Manager,1100100,1101360
4,So {disfmarker},User Interface,1101360,1102260
4,"because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .",Project Manager,1102260,1107060
4,Yeah . Maybe uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1107060,1108740
4,I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing,1108740,1112940
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,1112940,1114200
4,"Yeah , when you press it .",Industrial Designer,1114200,1115760
4,But if you {disfmarker},Project Manager,1115760,1117140
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1117140,1118040
4,I it's it's just uh the the {disfmarker},Marketing,1118040,1120440
4,"Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,",Project Manager,1120440,1122900
4,Two ?,Industrial Designer,1122900,1123200
4,"and green is like it's okay , you press the button .",Project Manager,1123200,1126320
4,Mm .,Marketing,1126320,1126560
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,1126560,1127520
4,Maybe depends on uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1127520,1129440
4,Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .,Industrial Designer,1129440,1132680
4,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,1132680,1133580
4,Yes .,User Interface,1133580,1133880
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1133880,1134780
4,Yeah .,Marketing,1134780,1135140
4,"Okay , we make it red .",Project Manager,1135140,1136520
4,But maybe {disfmarker},User Interface,1136520,1137840
4,So,Industrial Designer,1137840,1137960
4,Well,User Interface,1137960,1138200
4,I know .,Industrial Designer,1138200,1138680
4,we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .,User Interface,1138680,1143060
4,You have to {disfmarker} The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1143060,1151220
4,{vocalsound} I I think uh the batteries will be uh {vocalsound} a little {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1151220,1156320

4,Oh .,User Interface,1166340,1166580
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,1166580,1167360
4,If we can still make that then {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,1167360,1170720
4,Uh maybe .,Industrial Designer,1170720,1171320
4,"Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red .",User Interface,1171320,1173600
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,1173600,1174320

4,It's just to indicate something's on .,User Interface,1175040,1177320
4,Yeah .,Marketing,1177320,1177680
4,Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .,Industrial Designer,1177680,1181760
4,But it's cool if it was green .,Project Manager,1181760,1183620
4,"Yeah . It's it's not very important ,",User Interface,1183620,1185840
4,"Green or red or whatever , it is cool . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,1185840,1188960
4,so yeah .,User Interface,1188960,1189500
4,"Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .",Industrial Designer,1189500,1192320
4,So mm {disfmarker},User Interface,1192320,1193400
4,"And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work .",Industrial Designer,1193400,1211280

4,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer,1263480,1264020

4,It uh search uh the pattern for itself .,Marketing,1269360,1271760
4,"Okay ,",User Interface,1271760,1272120
4,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1272120,1272900
4,so we use that .,User Interface,1272900,1273860
4,So it uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1273860,1281540
4,Yes .,Marketing,1281540,1281840
4,Yep .,User Interface,1281840,1282140

4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1292520,1292880
4,"That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .",Industrial Designer,1292880,1296720
4,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1296720,1297200
4,"But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .",Industrial Designer,1297200,1312200
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1312200,1312560
4,"And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .",Industrial Designer,1312560,1318140
4,Changing the signal .,Marketing,1318140,1319400
4,"And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting",Industrial Designer,1319400,1334640
4,Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager,1334640,1335420

4,Um that's connecting to all the components .,Industrial Designer,1352700,1355340
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1355340,1356060
4,"Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .",Industrial Designer,1356060,1381140

4,that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .,Industrial Designer,1388940,1392480

4,n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1481340,1485960
4,It must be around it then .,Marketing,1485960,1487580
4,Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing,Industrial Designer,1487580,1491960
4,"Yeah , then {disfmarker}",Marketing,1491960,1493400
4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1493400,1494300
4,"Yeah . Not not not not here , but here .",Marketing,1494300,1496700
4,Yeah . There . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1496700,1497960

4,"The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?",Project Manager,1499220,1503240
4,"{gap} Yeah , we're thinking about it .",User Interface,1503240,1505520
4,If you push {disfmarker},Project Manager,1505520,1506960
4,"Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh",User Interface,1506960,1509180
4,It lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea .,Project Manager,1509180,1512660
4,everything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ?,User Interface,1512660,1516200
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1516200,1516560
4,It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .,Project Manager,1516560,1520220
4,"Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's {disfmarker}",User Interface,1520220,1524120
4,Okay .,Marketing,1524120,1524480
4,It's f Yeah .,Project Manager,1524480,1525260

4,"Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote .",User Interface,1528560,1532100
4,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1532100,1532580
4,It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .,Project Manager,1532580,1535940
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1535940,1536300
4,"No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use {disfmarker}",User Interface,1536300,1541520
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing,1541520,1541880
4,"Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .",Project Manager,1541880,1543920

4,Yeah .,Marketing,1551900,1552260
4,Yep .,User Interface,1552260,1552560
4,"Maybe what Paul said , uh under the {disfmarker} on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .",Marketing,1552560,1561200
4,"Yeah , and then you {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But you have to make a sound device in it then .",Project Manager,1561200,1566900
4,And also it's {disfmarker},User Interface,1566900,1568460
4,"Yeah , there must be sound in it .",Marketing,1568460,1570500
4,But {disfmarker},Project Manager,1570500,1571460
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1571460,1571760
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1571760,1572120

4,I dunno .,Marketing,1574640,1575180
4,Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1575180,1583340
4,"Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .",Marketing,1583340,1586460
4,Uh I th,User Interface,1586460,1586880
4,Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .,Industrial Designer,1586880,1590060
4,"Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .",Marketing,1590060,1597200
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,1597200,1597980
4,I think uh you also have uh {vocalsound} remote controls with a lot of options .,User Interface,1597980,1602780
4,So {disfmarker},Marketing,1602780,1603680
4,But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1603680,1608840
4,Uh . We have to give our customers some extras .,Marketing,1608840,1611720
4,Yeah . I think we will save money with that .,User Interface,1611720,1614420
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,1614420,1615200
4,Okay . Are you almost finished or just {disfmarker},Project Manager,1615200,1618260

4,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager,1621800,1622580
4,Because I was short on time .,Industrial Designer,1622580,1624320
4,No worry .,Project Manager,1624320,1624920
4,But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .,Industrial Designer,1624920,1630320
4,"Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more . So maybe you have to {disfmarker} Yeah ?",Project Manager,1630320,1636500

I don't think so ,",Project Manager,1637580,1658820
4,"No ,",Industrial Designer,1658820,1659060
4,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,1659060,1660020
4,"and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .",Industrial Designer,1660020,1663560
4,No .,Marketing,1663560,1663800
4,"Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1663800,1670880
4,Yeah .,User Interface,1670880,1671240
4,Uh .,Marketing,1671240,1671480
4,We definitely should use it . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1671480,1674180
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1674180,1674480
4,"Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting .",Project Manager,1674480,1696800
4,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing,1696800,1697940
4,Oh . Mm .,Industrial Designer,1697940,1698480

4,{vocalsound},Marketing,1704720,1705440
4,So does it make some decision about that ? {vocalsound},Project Manager,1705440,1708740
4,Changes .,Marketing,1708740,1709280
4,{vocalsound},User Interface,1709280,1710000
4,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1710000,1711140
4,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,1711140,1712040
4,That kinda changes the whole situation .,Industrial Designer,1712040,1714440
4,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,1714440,1715340
4,"Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,",User Interface,1715340,1721460
4,That still stays .,Project Manager,1721460,1722540
4,to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .,User Interface,1722540,1725600
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1725600,1725960
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1725960,1726320
4,That's important I think and {disfmarker},User Interface,1726320,1728780
4,L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .,Marketing,1728780,1732380
4,"And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it .",User Interface,1732380,1739520
4,Oh .,Marketing,1739520,1739760
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1739760,1740120
4,So {disfmarker},User Interface,1740120,1741020
4,"Mm ah {disfmarker} I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1741020,1748400
4,"Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . {vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker}",Marketing,1748400,1753500
4,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .",User Interface,1753500,1756680
4,{vocalsound} No .,Industrial Designer,1756680,1757700
4,"So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . What other features can we put in ?",User Interface,1757700,1761720
4,"Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the {disfmarker} Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .",Industrial Designer,1761720,1774200
4,But uh some of you had uh something to read about um {vocalsound} uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?,Marketing,1774200,1784460
4,I didn't read {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1784460,1786020
4,That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy . That's cool .,Marketing,1786020,1789200
4,It's very fashion .,User Interface,1789200,1790340
4,I didn't read any,Industrial Designer,1790340,1791360
4,Twelve and you've got twelve .,Marketing,1791360,1793160
4,b Yeah . Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,1793160,1794360
4,Mm .,User Interface,1794360,1794600
4,I I know .,Industrial Designer,1794600,1795200
4,"Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .",Marketing,1795200,1801800
4,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1801800,1802040
4,That should be cool .,Marketing,1802040,1803300
4,"Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1803300,1808340
4,"If it's possible ,",Marketing,1808340,1809420
4,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,1809420,1809780
4,I don't think it's very expensive actually .,Project Manager,1809780,1812420
4,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,1812420,1813260
4,I dunno . I didn't read it .,Marketing,1813260,1814940
4,Mm .,User Interface,1814940,1815180
4,Why should it ?,Project Manager,1815180,1816080
4,"Yeah , I think it's {disfmarker}",User Interface,1816080,1818000
4,Uh if i if i,Marketing,1818000,1818720
4,You only have a microphone in it .,Project Manager,1818720,1820760
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1820760,1821120
4,I didn't have information about that .,Marketing,1821120,1823400
4,"But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1823400,1829580
4,"Nah , maybe {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1829580,1831020
4,"Ah that's a problem , but {disfmarker}",Marketing,1831020,1833300
4,And and uh w Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,1833300,1834440
4,Uh only in English . Only in English I think .,Marketing,1834440,1837200
4,What {disfmarker} But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh {disfmarker} Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever,User Interface,1837200,1846440
4,"Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1846440,1850340
4,uh one to have in channel one ?,User Interface,1850340,1852200
4,"No , that {disfmarker} Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do {vocalsound} do we do it ?",Marketing,1852200,1858260
4,"Yeah ,",User Interface,1858260,1858620
4,It's more if we if we do it .,Marketing,1858620,1860360
4,"I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .",User Interface,1860360,1864140
4,And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing,Industrial Designer,1864140,1867140
4,Yeah .,Marketing,1867140,1867500
4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1867500,1868400
4,Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .,Project Manager,1868400,1871340
4,Is {disfmarker},User Interface,1871340,1872240
4,"It {disfmarker} We have short time to to put it on the market ,",Project Manager,1872240,1876020
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,1876020,1876980
4,so that {disfmarker} We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .,Project Manager,1876980,1881480
4,Mm {disfmarker} Yeah well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,1881480,1884540
4,Okay .,Marketing,1884540,1884900
4,"Yeah , I think so . {gap}",Industrial Designer,1884900,1886400
4,"We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . {gap}",Project Manager,1886400,1891260
4,"Yeah , and uh and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,1891260,1893240
4,It's {disfmarker},User Interface,1893240,1894260
4,In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .,Marketing,1894260,1900020
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,1900020,1900380
4,I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .,User Interface,1900380,1907220
4,And and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1907220,1908420
4,Yeah . I think so .,Project Manager,1908420,1909560
4,"Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,1909560,1915980
4,"Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .",Marketing,1915980,1920900
4,"the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,1920900,1923720
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing,1923720,1924080
4,"Yeah . Well yeah ,",User Interface,1924080,1925160
4,it's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing,1925160,1926600
4,"that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one ,",User Interface,1926600,1932780
4,"But {disfmarker} Hmm yeah , T_V_ one .",Industrial Designer,1932780,1935060
4,but {disfmarker},User Interface,1935060,1936020
4,"Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .",Marketing,1936020,1941540

4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1945380,1945740
4,So,Project Manager,1945740,1945860
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1945860,1946340
4,we have to make some decisions . So,Project Manager,1946340,1948440
4,"Okay , no speech recognition .",Marketing,1948440,1950240
4,"you can see on the uh {disfmarker} So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1950240,1961340
4,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,1961340,1962480
4,"If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?",Project Manager,1962480,1969320
4,"Yeah , that's good .",Industrial Designer,1969320,1970520
4,"Okay , we just take that one .",Project Manager,1970520,1972320
4,Yep .,User Interface,1972320,1972620
4,"And what else , we have {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1972620,1974780
4,Also the one in the dark . So uh {disfmarker} It lights up when it's dark ?,User Interface,1974780,1979280
4,"Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .",Project Manager,1979280,1984200
4,I didn't {disfmarker},User Interface,1984200,1985460
4,"If you push something , it it all lights up .",Project Manager,1985460,1988160
4,Okay .,User Interface,1988160,1988520
4,"Yeah . Yeah yeah ,",Marketing,1988520,1989600
4,"Yeah , but um {disfmarker}",User Interface,1989600,1991160
4,it it mustn't work all the time .,Marketing,1991160,1993140
4,"Yes , that's what I mean .",User Interface,1993140,1994700
4,It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .,Marketing,1994700,1997520
4,Or you can switch it on or something .,Project Manager,1997520,1999800
4,So if you {disfmarker},Marketing,1999800,2001120
4,Or maybe when you {disfmarker},User Interface,2001120,2002920
4,"No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .",Marketing,2002920,2008680
4,yeah . It lights up all .,User Interface,2008680,2010180
4,"Yeah , that's right . You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .",Project Manager,2010180,2017920
4,"Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .",User Interface,2017920,2020140
4,"And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , {gap} if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .",Project Manager,2020140,2028240
4,"Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .",User Interface,2028240,2031780
4,"Mm , maybe it's a good idea .",Industrial Designer,2031780,2033520
4,"Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .",User Interface,2033520,2036820
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,2036820,2037180
4,Like uh phones .,User Interface,2037180,2038140

4,"Different colours . Okay ,",Project Manager,2038680,2040240
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,2040240,2040540
4,so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ?,Project Manager,2040540,2044560
4,"A see-through . Mm , that's cool .",Marketing,2044560,2046600
4,Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .,User Interface,2046600,2048400
4,"Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,",Project Manager,2048400,2055300
4,It's the standard {disfmarker},User Interface,2055300,2057100
4,and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .,Project Manager,2057100,2060820
4,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,",User Interface,2060820,2062560
4,But you have {disfmarker} You had a lot of different buttons .,Marketing,2062560,2066280
4,we but we don't {disfmarker} We don't really have any complicated buttons .,User Interface,2066280,2070780
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,2070780,2071080
4,"Yeah , maybe you have you have to {disfmarker} Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .",Project Manager,2071080,2081520
4,"Yeah okay , but {disfmarker} Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little {disfmarker}",User Interface,2081520,2090160
4,O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .,Project Manager,2090160,2098380
4,"No , I don't need don't need {disfmarker} Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .",User Interface,2098380,2104260
4,"Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .",Industrial Designer,2104260,2110500
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,2110500,2111760
4,I use teletext as well .,User Interface,2111760,2113200
4,So uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,2113200,2114280
4,"No , I use te teletext every day , I think .",Marketing,2114280,2116920
4,Hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer,2116920,2117640
4,"Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .",Project Manager,2117640,2121840
4,"Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,",User Interface,2121840,2126880
4,Mm .,Marketing,2126880,2127120
4,I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .,User Interface,2127120,2133060

5,Oop .,Marketing,60660,60960
5,"Um I have some points I would like to {disfmarker} uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um {vocalsound} first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,",Project Manager,60960,81120
5,Yeah .,User Interface,81120,81480
5,"so I could {disfmarker} uh can uh um use that in the in the report . {vocalsound} Um the second thing , um {vocalsound} I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange .",Project Manager,81480,100440
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,100440,101160

5,No .,Marketing,113040,113280
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,113280,114000
5,"we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um {vocalsound} I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .",Project Manager,114000,131400
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,131400,131760
5,"Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .",Project Manager,131760,141180
5,'Kay . Hmm ?,Marketing,141180,141900
5,Alright .,User Interface,141900,142440

5,Um yeah .,Project Manager,148080,148620
5,Yeah . Yeah . My method ? {vocalsound},Marketing,148620,150900
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,150900,152400
5,{vocalsound} How surprising . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,152400,154920
5,"Well , findings . Uh {disfmarker} Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,",Marketing,154920,172620
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,172620,174120
5,and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .,Marketing,174120,178500
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,178500,179220
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,179220,179940
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,179940,180660
5,Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes {gap} uh m material . But we {disfmarker} since we are concentrating on uh the younger group {disfmarker},Marketing,180660,190860
5,Uh w wait a sec wait a se,Project Manager,190860,192360
5,Oh wait uh wait up .,Industrial Designer,192360,193560
5,uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes,Project Manager,193560,197700
5,'Kay .,Marketing,197700,198060
5,Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah {gap} okay . The feel of {gap} to be spongy {disfmarker},Project Manager,198060,204060
5,Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?,Industrial Designer,204060,211500
5,"Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .",Marketing,211500,220920
5,Not something dull .,Industrial Designer,220920,222120
5,"But they like dark colours ,",User Interface,222120,223800
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,223800,224160
5,you said in the p,User Interface,224160,225180
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,225180,225900
5,"No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .",Marketing,225900,229620
5,Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .,User Interface,229620,234120
5,But {disfmarker},Marketing,234120,235080
5,I had {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface,235080,236940
5,But can you can you go back to that slide ? The {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer,236940,240720
5,Which one ?,Marketing,240720,241380
5,"just one slide back ,",Industrial Designer,241380,242640
5,This ?,Marketing,242640,243000
5,"no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .",Industrial Designer,243000,247260
5,Yes .,Marketing,247260,247560
5,"Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,247560,252720
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,252720,253440
5,"{vocalsound} Uh well , it might .",Marketing,253440,255420
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,255420,256140
5,But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But {disfmarker} Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .,Marketing,256140,264360
5,"Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it {disfmarker} maybe it rubber or or {disfmarker}",Project Manager,264360,271920
5,"Yeah , exactly .",Marketing,271920,272880
5,yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,272880,274440
5,"Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,",Marketing,274440,278100
5,Or we could make {disfmarker} oh .,User Interface,278100,280140
5,"but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So {disfmarker}",Marketing,280140,283620
5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,283620,284760
5,"Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .",Marketing,284760,298740
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,298740,299100
5,So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .,Marketing,299100,303120
5,"Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager,303120,304740
5,It's quite interesting . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,304740,306960
5,"You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .",Project Manager,306960,311820
5,"Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh {vocalsound} telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .",User Interface,311820,319860
5,Yes . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,319860,320940
5,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,320940,321720
5,It's the it's the rubber uh cover .,User Interface,321720,323820
5,"Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .",Project Manager,323820,325560
5,And it's uh colourful .,User Interface,325560,326940
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,326940,327300
5,"It looks likes a banana . {vocalsound} We have the fruit , we have the colours . {vocalsound} We have the simple design .",User Interface,327300,334560
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,334560,335280
5,Do you know the phone ?,Project Manager,335280,336660
5,"I don't know the phone ,",Industrial Designer,336660,338100
5,"It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,",Project Manager,338100,340260
5,but I can imagine it .,Industrial Designer,340260,341580
5,"I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,",Project Manager,341580,344940
5,Um thirty five .,User Interface,344940,345900
5,"Oh , that one , yes .",Industrial Designer,345900,347160
5,the very {disfmarker},Project Manager,347160,348420
5,And the b the light blue and {vocalsound} it's also in yellow .,User Interface,348420,352200
5,"Now I kn uh {disfmarker} oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .",Industrial Designer,352200,357300
5,"You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th",Project Manager,357300,359880
5,"I've seen it ,",Marketing,359880,360720
5,Okay . Okay . Um uh,Project Manager,360720,361860
5,but {disfmarker},Marketing,361860,362820
5,okay . Do you have {gap} {disfmarker} uh thit {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker},Project Manager,362820,367620
5,'Kay . Uh that's about it .,Marketing,367620,369240
5,"Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the {disfmarker} our target group .",Project Manager,369240,378480
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,378480,379200
5,Yes .,Marketing,379200,379500
5,And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .,Project Manager,379500,382920
5,Uh soft material .,Marketing,382920,384000
5,Okay .,Project Manager,384000,384360
5,"So {disfmarker} So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?",Industrial Designer,384360,391500
5,Uh the fancy look and feel .,Marketing,391500,393180
5,Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .,Industrial Designer,393180,396840
5,Yes . Apparently .,Marketing,396840,397920
5,"Okay , Roo ,",Project Manager,397920,398640
5,Yeah .,User Interface,398640,399000
5,could you do your presentation ?,Project Manager,399000,400920
5,"Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um {disfmarker}",User Interface,400920,409620
5,"Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .",Project Manager,409620,414120
5,"{vocalsound} Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .",User Interface,414120,434760
5,Shape .,Project Manager,434760,435180
5,So I suggest {disfmarker} I couldn't uh {disfmarker} I had a small uh mock-up uh {vocalsound} sign on the {vocalsound} on {gap} paper .,User Interface,435180,443280
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,443280,444000
5,{vocalsound} But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple {vocalsound} f uh a shape on uh {disfmarker} in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .,User Interface,444000,458280
5,"Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .",Industrial Designer,458280,463080
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,463080,463440
5,Yeah .,Marketing,463440,463800
5,"And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .",Project Manager,463800,472440
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,472440,472740
5,"Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,",Project Manager,472740,475620
5,Slippery .,Industrial Designer,475620,476220
5,s because um {disfmarker},Project Manager,476220,477720
5,"But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .",User Interface,477720,481740
5,You have to grab it .,Industrial Designer,481740,483000
5,"Yeah . Yeah , exactly .",Project Manager,483000,484380
5,So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .,User Interface,484380,487380
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,487380,487740
5,"Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,",Industrial Designer,487740,494940
5,"Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .",Project Manager,494940,497040
5,Yeah .,User Interface,497040,497400
5,so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .,Industrial Designer,497400,504780
5,"Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , {vocalsound}",Project Manager,504780,507840
5,So m Yes .,Industrial Designer,507840,508440
5,okay .,Project Manager,508440,508800
5,But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .,Industrial Designer,508800,512040
5,"Okay , good .",Project Manager,512040,512820
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,512820,513540
5,Great . {vocalsound},User Interface,513540,514740
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,514740,515460
5,"Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .",User Interface,515460,534660
5,"Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,",Project Manager,534660,537180
5,Yeah .,User Interface,537180,537540
5,yeah .,Project Manager,537540,537900
5,"So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .",User Interface,537900,545340
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,545340,546060
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,546060,546780
5,"Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}",Project Manager,546780,549120
5,"Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,",Industrial Designer,549120,551220
5,yeah .,Project Manager,551220,551580
5,"because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .",Industrial Designer,551580,597480
5,Okay .,Project Manager,597480,597840
5,"Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .",Industrial Designer,597840,612240
5,Yeah . Right .,User Interface,612240,613080
5,"But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . {vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .",Industrial Designer,613080,655320

5,"It would be very new ,",Industrial Designer,669240,670560
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,670560,671280

5,{vocalsound},Marketing,678060,678780
5,"this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're {disfmarker} you you have to um make some kind of energy {disfmarker} kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .",Industrial Designer,678780,696060
5,Like the watch .,User Interface,696060,697020

5,"I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .",Project Manager,706440,711180
5,Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .,Industrial Designer,711180,713160
5,"I mean solar is {disfmarker} of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .",Project Manager,713160,719880
5,Mm-hmm . Indeed .,Industrial Designer,719880,720900
5,Um hand dynamo {disfmarker},Project Manager,720900,722520
5,"But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}",User Interface,722520,728700
5,"Well , maybe m",Project Manager,728700,729540
5,"if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .",User Interface,729540,733980
5,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,733980,734880
5,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer,734880,735720
5,You you walk,User Interface,735720,736440
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,736440,736800
5,and uh {disfmarker} but uh you {disfmarker} you're sitting on a couch .,User Interface,736800,741060
5,"But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,",Industrial Designer,741060,774000
5,Yeah . And wha,Project Manager,774000,774840
5,"well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .",Industrial Designer,774840,779340
5,Okay .,Project Manager,779340,779700
5,"So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries",Industrial Designer,779700,788040
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,788040,788400
5,"and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .",Industrial Designer,788400,794880
5,"Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .",Project Manager,794880,800460
5,"Uh yes , it does .",Industrial Designer,800460,801540
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,801540,801900
5,I'll come to that later .,Industrial Designer,801900,803400
5,Okay .,Project Manager,803400,803760
5,"And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . {vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels .

5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,842940,843420

5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,872940,873420
5,I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .,User Interface,873420,878220
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,878220,879240
5,I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .,User Interface,879240,884700
5,"Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .",Industrial Designer,884700,889380
5,"This will be the remote , right ?",Project Manager,889380,891360
5,Yeah .,User Interface,891360,891720
5,Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?,Project Manager,891720,897000
5,"Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,",User Interface,897000,898920
5,Uh it's do it's done before .,Industrial Designer,898920,900660
5,Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker},Project Manager,900660,903300
5,but {disfmarker},User Interface,903300,904260
5,"Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .",Industrial Designer,904260,906360

5,Volume ?,Project Manager,912240,912720
5,"Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .",Industrial Designer,912720,919740
5,"A volume , okay .",User Interface,919740,920760
5,There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .,Industrial Designer,920760,926400
5,"Well , what about mute ?",Project Manager,926400,927840
5,About mute .,Industrial Designer,927840,928560
5,Thi i i m I guess uh th,Project Manager,928560,929940
5,"Well , yes .",Industrial Designer,929940,930660
5,this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker},Project Manager,930660,935760
5,"Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .",Industrial Designer,935760,940260
5,And click it to muten the device .,Project Manager,940260,942300
5,"Well , okay . It's quite goods .",Industrial Designer,942300,944220
5,And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .,Project Manager,944220,954060
5,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer,954060,954900
5,So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .,Project Manager,954900,960900
5,Yeah .,User Interface,960900,961260
5,"Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .",Project Manager,961260,965640
5,"Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,",Marketing,965640,967920
5,Wheel .,User Interface,967920,968340
5,it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .,Marketing,968340,972720
5,Okay .,Project Manager,972720,973080
5,"Hmm . {vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .",Industrial Designer,973080,981720
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,981720,982080
5,"And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .",Industrial Designer,982080,987300
5,"Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .",Project Manager,987300,991260
5,So maybe it's not no {gap} .,Industrial Designer,991260,992940
5,"Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .",Project Manager,992940,1002960
5,"Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .",Industrial Designer,1002960,1005720
5,"Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .",Project Manager,1005720,1009320
5,It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1009320,1014600
5,"For you too , yeah .",Project Manager,1014600,1015800
5,"Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .",User Interface,1015800,1029540
5,"Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .",Industrial Designer,1029540,1031760

5,"Yes . {gap} yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .",Industrial Designer,1037280,1039560
5,Okay . Sebastian . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1039560,1041600
5,"Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .",Industrial Designer,1041600,1057140
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,1057140,1057500
5,"There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation . {vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .",Industrial Designer,1057500,1092060
5,"{vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .",User Interface,1092060,1104960
5,Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1104960,1108200
5,"Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function",User Interface,1108200,1114980
5,okay .,Industrial Designer,1114980,1115340
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1115340,1116060
5,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1116060,1116960
5,"and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,",User Interface,1116960,1125900
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1125900,1126260
5,"and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,1126260,1130280
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1130280,1130760
5,It performs the action . Yeah .,Project Manager,1130760,1132620
5,"Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .",User Interface,1132620,1137840
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1137840,1138200
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,1138200,1138560
5,"So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .",User Interface,1138560,1145820
5,"{vocalsound} Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .",Industrial Designer,1145820,1178280
5,Okay . Uh well {disfmarker} uh,Project Manager,1178280,1180080
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1180080,1180440
5,d did we already decide on the display ? To {disfmarker},Project Manager,1180440,1183800
5,"Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .",Industrial Designer,1183800,1187940
5,"Yeah . Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display .",User Interface,1187940,1198860
5,No .,Project Manager,1198860,1199100
5,"Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,1199100,1203780
5,I I don't think either .,Industrial Designer,1203780,1205220
5,"'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,",User Interface,1205220,1210560
5,No . I don't think you need it .,Industrial Designer,1210560,1212480
5,On screen display . Yeah .,Project Manager,1212480,1214040
5,yeah .,User Interface,1214040,1214400
5,Okay,Project Manager,1214400,1214640
5,"Okay . Okay , well",Industrial Designer,1214640,1215720
5,th,Project Manager,1215720,1215840
5,"my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .",Industrial Designer,1215840,1238760
5,Okay . Good .,Project Manager,1238760,1239540
5,So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1239540,1243260
5,Kineti okay .,Project Manager,1243260,1244040
5,"The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .",Industrial Designer,1244040,1252800
5,"Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,",Project Manager,1252800,1255200
5,"Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,",Industrial Designer,1255200,1258140
5,too {disfmarker},Project Manager,1258140,1259100
5,uh well .,Industrial Designer,1259100,1259640
5,yeah .,Project Manager,1259640,1260000
5,"It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .",Industrial Designer,1260000,1266300
5,"Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .",Project Manager,1266300,1271580
5,But {disfmarker} Yes . And I think it's more robust .,Industrial Designer,1271580,1274760
5,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager,1274760,1275540
5,It's more uh Uh it's more functional .,Industrial Designer,1275540,1277820
5,But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,1277820,1285260
5,"No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said .",Project Manager,1285260,1289040
5,The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1289040,1292340
5,"He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .",Project Manager,1292340,1299360
5,"Okay . Oh ,",User Interface,1299360,1300020
5,So um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1300020,1301100
5,sorry . Yeah .,User Interface,1301100,1301940
5,"So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,",Industrial Designer,1301940,1304880
5,Yeah .,User Interface,1304880,1305240
5,and we should uh use wood or something like that .,Industrial Designer,1305240,1308240
5,"No ,",Project Manager,1308240,1308480
5,And I would think {disfmarker},User Interface,1308480,1310280

5,r,Project Manager,1310460,1310520
5,"yeah ,",Marketing,1310520,1310880
5,rubber with colours .,Project Manager,1310880,1312140
5,"the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood .",Marketing,1312140,1315320

5,No the {disfmarker},Marketing,1318140,1319280
5,Colourful and {disfmarker},Project Manager,1319280,1320840
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1320840,1321200
5,"Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .",Marketing,1321200,1324020
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,1324020,1324380
5,"Okay , spongy materials .",Industrial Designer,1324380,1325880
5,Yeah . {vocalsound},Marketing,1325880,1327020
5,"Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .",Industrial Designer,1327020,1332240
5,And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?,User Interface,1332240,1335180
5,"So {disfmarker} Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1335180,1342020
5,"Okay , but we also {disfmarker} uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker {disfmarker}",User Interface,1342020,1348800
5,"Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1348800,1353780
5,"oh ,",User Interface,1353780,1354020
5,"But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,",Project Manager,1354020,1356660
5,evalu,User Interface,1356660,1356960
5,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,1356960,1357860
5,"{gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .",Industrial Designer,1357860,1365120
5,I it's too dull . Yeah .,Project Manager,1365120,1366560
5,I don't think c our customers will like it .,Industrial Designer,1366560,1369200
5,Yeah .,Marketing,1369200,1369560
5,"And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .",Industrial Designer,1369560,1378620
5,Yeah . Okay . Okay .,Project Manager,1378620,1379820
5,So I think this is the best of two worlds .,Industrial Designer,1379820,1382400
5,"Okay , what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour",Project Manager,1382400,1392540
5,Yes . It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .,Industrial Designer,1392540,1400220
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,1400220,1400580
5,It's very unlogical .,Industrial Designer,1400580,1401840
5,{vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .,User Interface,1401840,1406820
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,1406820,1407840
5,Well the there has to be some pointing at . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1407840,1411440
5,It depends also on your on your {disfmarker},Project Manager,1411440,1414080
5,"Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just {vocalsound} to the other wall .",User Interface,1414080,1421820
5,"Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably {disfmarker} you're probably right .",Project Manager,1421820,1429920
5,Yeah .,User Interface,1429920,1430280
5,"But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um {disfmarker} yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .",Project Manager,1430280,1439820
5,"All lights get absorbed , yeah . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,1439820,1442520
5,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,1442520,1443420
5,"Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .",Industrial Designer,1443420,1447140
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,1447140,1447500
5,So {vocalsound} it has an {disfmarker} it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .,Industrial Designer,1447500,1457700
5,And the regular chip .,User Interface,1457700,1459020
5,I think uh it gives us the advantage of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1459020,1462140
5,And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .,User Interface,1462140,1464780
5,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,1464780,1465440
5,{vocalsound} I like the scroll wheels uh idea .,Project Manager,1465440,1468260

5,"Yeah . Okay , um",Project Manager,1678680,1679640
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1679640,1680540
5,th,Project Manager,1680540,1680660
5,So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .,Industrial Designer,1680660,1684860
5,"Battery and solar , yeah .",Project Manager,1684860,1686420
5,Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?,Industrial Designer,1686420,1692060
5,"Yeah , with colourful rubber .",Project Manager,1692060,1693860
5,Yeah .,User Interface,1693860,1694220

5,Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .,Project Manager,1709100,1711920

5,"Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .",User Interface,1714140,1716540
5,"Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,",Project Manager,1716540,1721760
5,Hmm .,Marketing,1721760,1722060
5,but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .,Project Manager,1722060,1726200
5,"Oh , I think it's uh {disfmarker} it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?",Industrial Designer,1726200,1732260
5,"Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .",Project Manager,1732260,1737240
5,I believe the {disfmarker} But you have already um {disfmarker} you must have a red uh on and off button . And um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface,1737240,1746960
5,"Well , it it doesn't have to be red . Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image",Project Manager,1746960,1760460
5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1760460,1760760
5,"or or {disfmarker} I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .",Project Manager,1760760,1767840
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1767840,1768200
5,Or black and yellow .,Marketing,1768200,1769460

5,{vocalsound},Marketing,1770960,1771680
5,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",Industrial Designer,1771680,1772820
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,1772820,1773540
5,but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1773540,1784460
5,"Well , there is . {vocalsound} Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,",User Interface,1784460,1789620

5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} No .,User Interface,1793400,1795200
5,but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .,Industrial Designer,1795200,1802460
5,"Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .",Project Manager,1802460,1805820
5,So {disfmarker} So I'm afraid it's not possible .,Industrial Designer,1805820,1808760
5,Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1808760,1813860
5,A scroll-wheel .,User Interface,1813860,1814820

5,"Voice recognition , of course .",User Interface,1818780,1820640
5,"Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .",Industrial Designer,1820640,1825320
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,1825320,1825680
5,"And th the {disfmarker} they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .",Industrial Designer,1825680,1831020
5,Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1831020,1834320
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,1834320,1835040
5,What what did you say ?,User Interface,1835040,1836420
5,"Well uh you can use {disfmarker} well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .",Industrial Designer,1836420,1842780
5,Yeah .,User Interface,1842780,1843140
5,So it has th the spongy uh feel also .,Industrial Designer,1843140,1845420
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,1845420,1845780
5,"Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber .",User Interface,1845780,1849200
5,"{vocalsound} I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i",Project Manager,1849200,1857840
5,"Yeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .",User Interface,1857840,1864320
5,{gap} .,Project Manager,1864320,1864740
5,"What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .",User Interface,1864740,1872060
5,Uh is that {disfmarker} uh does our our supplier say so ?,Project Manager,1872060,1875480
5,"It is not uh something uh {disfmarker} it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from {disfmarker}",User Interface,1875480,1882320
5,Uh didn't {disfmarker} did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?,Marketing,1882320,1888620
5,"No , but but uh it {disfmarker}",User Interface,1888620,1890480
5,'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .,Marketing,1890480,1894560
5,Yeah . You could place a {disfmarker} um uh this this would be the button .,Project Manager,1894560,1899060
5,There {disfmarker} the icons .,Marketing,1899060,1900860
5,"The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place the indica th th the signals the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1900860,1906440
5,"Yeah , b yeah .",User Interface,1906440,1907340
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,1907340,1907640
5,"Yeah , that's possible ,",User Interface,1907640,1909080
5,That's okay .,Industrial Designer,1909080,1909860
5,So you don't touch the icons that much .,Marketing,1909860,1912260
5,"but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .",User Interface,1912260,1923660
5,"No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or {disfmarker} But it's into the rubber .",Project Manager,1923660,1928880

5,"Yeah , but this is on the pla",Project Manager,1931820,1933560

5,"yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .",Project Manager,1936560,1941720
5,"Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh {disfmarker} You just move the problem .",User Interface,1941720,1946520
5,What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?,Project Manager,1946520,1950000
5,"Uh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .",Industrial Designer,1950000,1959960
5,"Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel .",Project Manager,1959960,1972080
5,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1972080,1972440

5,Y uh can you separate these uh these {disfmarker},User Interface,1980060,1983000
5,"I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber .

6,Sorry .,User Interface,29460,29880
6,"Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um {disfmarker} try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of {disfmarker} oh oh you can see it , okay {vocalsound} .

6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,60900,61620
6,"Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer .

6,Yep .,User Interface,100980,101280

6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,108240,108960
6,"'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,108960,162960
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,162960,163680
6,"Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .",Industrial Designer,163680,199500
6,"Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,",Marketing,199500,203760
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,203760,204240
6,Yeah sure .,Industrial Designer,204240,204900
6,is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?,Marketing,204900,210840
6,"Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,",Industrial Designer,210840,220020
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,220020,220500
6,they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .,Industrial Designer,220500,224760
6,"Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?",Marketing,224760,229200
6,Yeah the the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,229200,230700
6,Okay .,User Interface,230700,231060
6,They are .,Project Manager,231060,231660
6,well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption,Industrial Designer,231660,237840
6,Oh I see .,Marketing,237840,238440
6,and how much you need to send the data across .,Industrial Designer,238440,241260
6,Okay .,Marketing,241260,241620
6,"Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .",Industrial Designer,241620,302280
6,{gap},User Interface,302280,302580
6,"It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,",Industrial Designer,302580,380460
6,Mm . Mm .,Marketing,380460,381000
6,I {disfmarker} th that was just sort of a general point there .,Industrial Designer,381000,384780
6,Mm .,Marketing,384780,385020
6,{vocalsound} And that's uh {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer,385020,387780

6,Meter adjusting .,Marketing,427920,428940
6,{gap} okay .,User Interface,428940,429660
6,"Oh , there {gap} .",Project Manager,429660,430740
6,"Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,",User Interface,430740,435840
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,435840,436200
6,"but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,",User Interface,436200,561180
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,561180,561540
6,"with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that .",User Interface,561540,591240
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,591240,591600
6,So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .,User Interface,591600,594720

6,"yeah , there you go .",Industrial Designer,649620,650880
6,"Get it right over , okay , thank you .",Marketing,650880,653160
6,Ah . Look at that .,Project Manager,653160,654300
6,"Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,",Marketing,654300,736140
6,Yeah .,User Interface,736140,736500
6,"so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,",Marketing,736500,848820
6,'Kay .,User Interface,848820,849180

6,Okay .,User Interface,864540,864900
6,"um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now .

6,Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming .,Project Manager,930660,936480

6,Hmm .,Project Manager,969180,969480

6,so I thought that could be quite a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1024140,1026960
6,Right .,Marketing,1026960,1027380
6,"We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing",Project Manager,1027380,1036200
6,Mm .,Marketing,1036200,1036440
6,"um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,",Project Manager,1036440,1046940
6,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1046940,1047720
6,"maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps",Project Manager,1047720,1058760
6,Okay .,User Interface,1058760,1059120
6,"and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,",Project Manager,1059120,1062900
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1062900,1063260
6,Yes . That's a super idea .,Marketing,1063260,1064880
6,but that's {disfmarker} that sounds a lot cheaper to me .,Project Manager,1064880,1068300
6,Hmm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1068300,1069020
6,Yeah .,Marketing,1069020,1069380
6,"Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .",Project Manager,1069380,1088760
6,"Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty",Marketing,1088760,1098000
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,1098000,1098360
6,"and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,",Marketing,1098360,1109040
6,Mm .,Project Manager,1109040,1109280
6,"you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .",Marketing,1109280,1126860
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1126860,1127220
6,"So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs {gap} ?",User Interface,1127220,1131480
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,1131480,1131840
6,Sure .,User Interface,1131840,1132200
6,Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs,Industrial Designer,1132200,1136160
6,Alright .,User Interface,1136160,1136700
6,I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .,Industrial Designer,1136700,1139940
6,Right .,User Interface,1139940,1140360
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1140360,1140840
6,The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .,User Interface,1140840,1145100
6,Just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1145100,1146120
6,Yeah .,Marketing,1146120,1146480
6,"yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1146480,1147260
6,Mm .,Marketing,1147260,1147500
6,So {disfmarker},User Interface,1147500,1148400
6,"What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons ,",Project Manager,1148400,1152000
6,Yeah .,User Interface,1152000,1152360
6,"um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers",Project Manager,1152360,1166580
6,"'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer,1166580,1170240
6,"yeah ? Um so you {disfmarker} it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1170240,1180080
6,{gap},User Interface,1180080,1180380
6,"No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to {disfmarker} you don't actually have to press them you just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1180380,1187160
6,"You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .",Project Manager,1187160,1191360
6,{gap},User Interface,1191360,1191660
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1191660,1192020
6,"Um , think that might appeal {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,",Project Manager,1192020,1198800
6,Mm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1198800,1199580
6,trendy kind of a thing .,Project Manager,1199580,1201020
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1201020,1201380
6,Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def,Marketing,1201380,1204260
6,"Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for",Project Manager,1204260,1210320
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1210320,1210800
6,"and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1210800,1215000
6,"Mm-hmm , mm .",Marketing,1215000,1215780
6,"Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big",Industrial Designer,1215780,1234860
6,Were too big .,Project Manager,1234860,1235700
6,because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands,Industrial Designer,1235700,1240860
6,Mm .,Project Manager,1240860,1241100
6,so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .,Industrial Designer,1241100,1255740
6,"Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .",User Interface,1255740,1266660
6,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1266660,1267440
6,"So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .",User Interface,1267440,1277160
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1277160,1277640
6,Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control,User Interface,1277640,1281720
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1281720,1282080
6,"and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .",User Interface,1282080,1285680
6,I think we have to design one product,Project Manager,1285680,1287900
6,Hmm . Huh .,Industrial Designer,1287900,1288560
6,and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh,Project Manager,1288560,1291980
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1291980,1292340
6,"in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .",Project Manager,1292340,1299480
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1299480,1299840
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1299840,1300320
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1300320,1300800
6,"Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .",Marketing,1300800,1305840
6,"It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .",Project Manager,1305840,1313580
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1313580,1313940
6,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .",Marketing,1313940,1334520
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1334520,1334880
6,"I'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,",Marketing,1334880,1337820
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1337820,1338180
6,this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .,Marketing,1338180,1343700
6,I {disfmarker} yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause {disfmarker} without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel,Industrial Designer,1343700,1354740
6,"Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .",Marketing,1354740,1357980
6,and it becomes {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1357980,1359600
6,"Or a speech recognition ,",Project Manager,1359600,1361100
6,"yeah . Yeah , speech recognition ,",Industrial Designer,1361100,1363140
6,Yeah .,Marketing,1363140,1363500
6,"which is extremely expensive ,",Project Manager,1363500,1365300
6,but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1365300,1366260
6,I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .,Project Manager,1366260,1370520
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,1370520,1370880
6,"Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .",Marketing,1370880,1383900
6,We could focus on the biggest market .,User Interface,1383900,1386180
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1386180,1386420
6,Mm .,Marketing,1386420,1386660
6,If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?,User Interface,1386660,1391520
6,Ge uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1391520,1392600
6,"And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .",Marketing,1392600,1400040
6,"We are {disfmarker} we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable ,",Project Manager,1400040,1408200
6,{vocalsound},Marketing,1408200,1408920
6,they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume {disfmarker} associate that with the older generations .,Project Manager,1408920,1416120
6,Mm .,Marketing,1416120,1416360
6,"Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,",Project Manager,1416360,1423860
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1423860,1424220
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1424220,1424700
6,Mm-hmm {vocalsound} .,Marketing,1424700,1425960
6,"but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .",Project Manager,1425960,1433820
6,"Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate",Marketing,1433820,1444560
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1444560,1445040
6,"and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first {disfmarker} it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .",Marketing,1445040,1456740
6,"Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ ,",Project Manager,1456740,1460580
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1460580,1461060
6,"we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,",Project Manager,1461060,1468380
6,Video plus .,Industrial Designer,1468380,1469100
6,"yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1469100,1475520
6,Yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer,1475520,1476180
6,"I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um",Project Manager,1476180,1479600
6,Mm .,Marketing,1479600,1479840
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1479840,1480320
6,"because you've got your general record anyway so if you {disfmarker} there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in",Project Manager,1480320,1495320
6,Just whack in the number .,Industrial Designer,1495320,1496880
6,"and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,",Project Manager,1496880,1505220
6,And you w {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1505220,1506540
6,it's just a number .,Project Manager,1506540,1507740
6,"yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,",Industrial Designer,1507740,1512840
6,No .,Project Manager,1512840,1513080
6,"you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,",Industrial Designer,1513080,1517520
6,You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .,Project Manager,1517520,1520700
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,1520700,1521060
6,"Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful {vocalsound} .",Marketing,1521060,1525920
6,It is,Project Manager,1525920,1526220
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1526220,1526940
6,"after um {disfmarker} if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards",Project Manager,1526940,1534500
6,It's not {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1534500,1536180
6,and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth,Project Manager,1536180,1543440
6,"Ah , hmm .",Marketing,1543440,1544040
6,"so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,",Project Manager,1544040,1548840
6,Right .,Marketing,1548840,1549260
6,um and it has been around for quite a long time .,Project Manager,1549260,1552200
6,It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .,Industrial Designer,1552200,1558800
6,No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that {disfmarker},Project Manager,1558800,1564800
6,Superb . Mm .,Marketing,1564800,1565580
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1565580,1565820
6,Yes .,Marketing,1565820,1566120
6,Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it {disfmarker} you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on,Industrial Designer,1566120,1577280
6,Mm .,Project Manager,1577280,1577520
6,Right .,Marketing,1577520,1577940
6,and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .,Industrial Designer,1577940,1581780
6,"Excellent , mm-hmm .",Marketing,1581780,1582980
6,So that {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer,1582980,1584600
6,Mm .,Marketing,1584600,1584840
6,But just to have that function would be would be really good .,Industrial Designer,1584840,1588560
6,Right .,Marketing,1588560,1588980
6,Okay so {disfmarker},Project Manager,1588980,1590180
6,"Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , {gap} to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,",Marketing,1590180,1621560
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1621560,1621920

6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1625400,1625880
6,"Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?",Marketing,1625880,1647120
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1647120,1647360
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1647360,1648080
6,But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um {disfmarker} the companies who uh who you deal with have actually {disfmarker} they've they've got an obligation to to help you out,Industrial Designer,1648080,1661100
6,Mm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1661100,1661880
6,and also {disfmarker} I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1661880,1671060
6,Right .,Marketing,1671060,1671480
6,"The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?",Project Manager,1671480,1685640

6,I think so .,Project Manager,1700940,1701660
6,"Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1701660,1703220

6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1707600,1708500
6,I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .,Industrial Designer,1708500,1712460
6,"Instruction manuals . But I mean they're {disfmarker} there's customer service ,",Project Manager,1712460,1717260

6,"Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1796220,1806300
6,"Well they la they they last quite a long time ,",Project Manager,1806300,1809120
6,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1809120,1809600
6,"and if you had uh {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,",Project Manager,1809600,1820700
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1820700,1821060
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1821060,1821540
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1821540,1821900
6,but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .,Project Manager,1821900,1828440
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1828440,1828800
6,"Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .",Project Manager,1828800,1832100
6,Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1832100,1845120
6,"Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay .",Project Manager,1845120,1848180
6,Yeah on that as well so .,Industrial Designer,1848180,1849680
6,So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?,User Interface,1849680,1854120
6,S,Project Manager,1854120,1854180
6,Yeah,Industrial Designer,1854180,1854420
6,Yes .,Project Manager,1854420,1854720
6,some sort of docking station or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1854720,1857360
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1857360,1857840
6,Rechargeable with a docking station .,Project Manager,1857840,1860060
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,1860060,1860420
6,So the rechargeable which would be your field .,Project Manager,1860420,1863240
6,"Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,",Industrial Designer,1863240,1865580
6,Okay .,Project Manager,1865580,1865940
6,and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .,Industrial Designer,1865940,1871040
6,Right .,User Interface,1871040,1871460
6,"Yes ,",Project Manager,1871460,1871760
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1871760,1872240
6,which it is cheaper in the long run as well .,Project Manager,1872240,1874940
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1874940,1875300
6,"Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either ,",Project Manager,1875300,1883100
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1883100,1883580
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1883580,1884060

6,Mm .,Marketing,1892280,1892520
6,um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1892520,1893420
6,"And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,",Marketing,1893420,1897800
6,They do .,Project Manager,1897800,1898340
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1898340,1898700
6,"these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely {disfmarker} an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .",Marketing,1898700,1912620
6,Okay so we've got a flip-screen .,Project Manager,1912620,1914600
6,Okay .,User Interface,1914600,1914960
6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1914960,1915860

6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1925880,1926240
6,"That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,",User Interface,1926240,1933560
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1933560,1934040
6,"and you don't have to {disfmarker} you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .",User Interface,1934040,1943280
6,"Slightly curved , curved .",Marketing,1943280,1944840
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1944840,1945200
6,Okay .,Project Manager,1945200,1945560
6,G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't,User Interface,1945560,1952880
6,Mm .,Marketing,1952880,1953120
6,'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .,Project Manager,1953120,1956060
6,y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your {disfmarker},User Interface,1956060,1960740
6,Mm .,Marketing,1960740,1960980
6,"the way you h hold of {disfmarker} it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .",User Interface,1960980,1966920
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1966920,1967280

6,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1989780,1990800

6,{gap},Marketing,1996560,1996860
6,while also making it quite different from anything else that's there .,Project Manager,1996860,2001060
6,"We could look in at that but {disfmarker} Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells ,",User Interface,2001060,2008020
6,I mean look at the mobile .,Marketing,2008020,2009640

6,Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different .,Project Manager,2020620,2024160

6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,2036880,2037240
6,"Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea",Marketing,2037240,2056200
6,Yeah we could look in at that .,User Interface,2056200,2058060
6,"and plus you can get {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know even though we're using plastic , you can still {disfmarker} I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .",Marketing,2058060,2071620
6,"Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings .",Project Manager,2071620,2079240
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,2079240,2079480
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,2079480,2079960
6,So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and {disfmarker},Project Manager,2079960,2085360
6,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa",Marketing,2085360,2092560
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,2092560,2092920
6,and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't {disfmarker} not gonna lose it so much {vocalsound} either . It's easier to {disfmarker} bit nice to handle .,Marketing,2092920,2107620
6,Mm .,Project Manager,2107620,2107860

6,Okay .,Project Manager,2119260,2119620
6,Okay .,Marketing,2119620,2119980

6,"our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .",Marketing,2136960,2142780

6,"Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you {disfmarker} it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ?

6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,2191740,2192100

Does everyone have presentations ?",Project Manager,26400,46860
7,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,46860,47160

7,Sure .,Industrial Designer,50400,50760
7,Okay .,Project Manager,50760,51120
7,"So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .",Industrial Designer,51120,132060
7,And why not wood ?,Project Manager,132060,133140
7,"And ,",Industrial Designer,133140,133440
7,And why not wood ? {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Project Manager,133440,136440
7,"hmm ? {vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood . {vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design .",Industrial Designer,136440,161280
7,'S good .,Project Manager,161280,161820
7,"Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material",Marketing,161820,166020

7,"Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use .

7,Mm .,Project Manager,218100,218340
7,"The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go .

7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,258600,259320

7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,273360,274080
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,274080,274800
7,"Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine .

7,Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound},Project Manager,327780,331680
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,331680,332400
7,"So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .",User Interface,332400,353040
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,353040,353760
7,"And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?",User Interface,353760,368460
7,Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .,Project Manager,368460,370800
7,'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel,User Interface,370800,380280
7,You need a screen for it ?,Project Manager,380280,381840
7,you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen .,User Interface,381840,385200
7,"You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,385200,396000
7,"But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?",User Interface,396000,408180
7,"We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,",Project Manager,408180,411000
7,Are we {disfmarker},User Interface,411000,412140
7,that was one of th I I was {disfmarker},Project Manager,412140,414480
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,414480,414840
7,Okay .,User Interface,414840,415200
7,"sorry ,",Project Manager,415200,415620
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,415620,416340
7,I I meant to update you on that . Um .,Project Manager,416340,418620
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,418620,419340
7,{vocalsound} Alright . Okay .,User Interface,419340,421080
7,"But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said .",Marketing,421080,425220
7,Okay . Okay .,User Interface,425220,426000
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,426000,426360
7,That correct ?,Marketing,426360,427200
7,So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right .,User Interface,427200,447840
7,Graphical interface ?,Marketing,447840,449100
7,Yeah like you're g,User Interface,449100,450180
7,Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though .,Marketing,450180,453780
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,453780,454140
7,"yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can {disfmarker} okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .",User Interface,454140,472320
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,472320,472680
7,So that {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} people seems to be {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface,472680,478020
7,"You've {disfmarker} Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to {disfmarker}",Project Manager,478020,482760
7,You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um {vocalsound} I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because {disfmarker} So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if {disfmarker} or or {disfmarker} then again if you just {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .,User Interface,482760,510480
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,510480,511680
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,511680,512040
7,You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or {disfmarker},User Interface,512040,517080
7,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing,517080,517860
7,But but imagine someone with s,Project Manager,517860,519660
7,"My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,519660,524460
7,I oh yeah ?,User Interface,524460,525120
7,But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager,525120,533340
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,533340,534060
7,'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker},User Interface,534060,536400
7,Yeah .,Marketing,536400,536760
7,They have to r wheel really fast .,Industrial Designer,536760,538800
7,but you can quickly s you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,538800,542100
7,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager,542100,543240
7,"But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,",Industrial Designer,543240,546840
7,Yeah .,User Interface,546840,547200
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,547200,548400
7,at least on theirs .,Industrial Designer,548400,549600
7,"Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different",User Interface,549600,575040
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,575040,575400
7,"uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth",User Interface,575400,588660
7,Right .,Project Manager,588660,589080
7,"And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,",User Interface,589080,607860
7,"Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better ,",Project Manager,607860,615540
7,like {disfmarker},User Interface,615540,616560
7,"because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,616560,620280
7,"I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker}",User Interface,620280,631980
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,631980,632340
7,"but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker}",User Interface,632340,644520
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,644520,644880
7,It's more expensive according to the design people .,Industrial Designer,644880,648000
7,m yeah .,User Interface,648000,648480
7,Uh . {vocalsound},Project Manager,648480,649500
7,"Yeah , that's the only thing though .",User Interface,649500,651720
7,"You have to get a {disfmarker} an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .",Industrial Designer,651720,661920
7,"Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um {disfmarker}",User Interface,661920,669540
7,Mm .,Project Manager,669540,669780
7,"{vocalsound} You can get to {disfmarker} you know , you can {disfmarker} Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can {disfmarker} it brings up like the menu on the T_V_",User Interface,669780,682560
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,682560,683760
7,Mm .,Project Manager,683760,684000
7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,684000,684480
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,684480,684840
7,"and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the {disfmarker}",User Interface,684840,689640
7,Yeah .,Marketing,689640,690000
7,"So the T_V_ is the screen , that {disfmarker} yeah",Project Manager,690000,693000
7,"yeah , yeah .",User Interface,693000,693780
7,So it would have all these different options of changing,Project Manager,693780,697140
7,Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .,User Interface,697140,700500
7,to {disfmarker},Project Manager,700500,701400
7,Look it even has settings .,Marketing,701400,703020
7,Okay .,Project Manager,703020,703380
7,Hmm ?,User Interface,703380,703680
7,On the {disfmarker},Marketing,703680,704820
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,704820,705180
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,705180,705900
7,{vocalsound} you can just take theirs and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing,705900,710220
7,"Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,",User Interface,710220,712980
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,712980,713340
7,"but um {disfmarker} 'cause that just {disfmarker} it does seem like , it {disfmarker} that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but {disfmarker} I dunno , and then {disfmarker} so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .",User Interface,713340,730500
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,730500,731220
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface,731220,732120
7,"Um , right . What if {disfmarker} I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes ,",Project Manager,732120,739980
7,Yeah .,User Interface,739980,740340
7,"um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing ,",Project Manager,740340,744300
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,744300,745020
7,or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or {disfmarker},Project Manager,745020,752520
7,It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .,User Interface,752520,763800
7,Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager,763800,771240
7,Yeah . Yeah definitely .,User Interface,771240,772680
7,okay .,Project Manager,772680,773040
7,"Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .",User Interface,773040,782880
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,782880,783240
7,I mean it it needs to be easy to {disfmarker},User Interface,783240,785940
7,Yeah but should be comfortable .,Marketing,785940,787860
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,787860,788220
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,788220,788580
7,somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your {disfmarker},User Interface,788580,792900
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,792900,793260
7,"I mean how do how do {disfmarker} I'm not really {disfmarker} Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So {disfmarker}",User Interface,793260,803340
7,"Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .",Project Manager,803340,807840
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,807840,808560
7,{vocalsound} Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So {disfmarker},User Interface,808560,812400
7,Yeah I use it like that .,Marketing,812400,813900
7,"W when we had the wheely remote control , we {disfmarker} it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .",Industrial Designer,813900,820620
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,820620,820980
7,Yeah .,User Interface,820980,821340
7,Yeah .,Marketing,821340,821700
7,"But , were there buttons on there as well ?",Project Manager,821700,824280
7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,824280,825600
7,Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .,Industrial Designer,825600,832500
7,Mm . Yeah .,Project Manager,832500,833160
7,So we just used the top part .,Industrial Designer,833160,834960
7,Mm yeah .,User Interface,834960,835500
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,835500,835860
7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker} but I mean I think it could be pretty small .",User Interface,835860,839940
7,Uh .,Marketing,839940,840180
7,"Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can {disfmarker}",User Interface,840180,844980
7,"What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you {disfmarker} so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .",Project Manager,844980,863460
7,But can't you just get {disfmarker},User Interface,863460,865560
7,"Do {disfmarker} do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something {disfmarker}",Project Manager,865560,871800
7,Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,871800,878700
7,K,User Interface,878700,878760
7,"Well you can have it on the settings ,",Marketing,878760,881040
7,"Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,881040,883740
7,no ?,Marketing,883740,883980
7,"Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen .",User Interface,883980,893940
7,Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing,Project Manager,893940,896100
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,896100,896460
7,is is {disfmarker} if w I {disfmarker},Project Manager,896460,898740
7,That keeps it,User Interface,898740,899520
7,"if we can do this , that'd probably be {disfmarker}",Project Manager,899520,902580
7,really {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh you wouldn't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I just don't think you would even need it .,User Interface,902580,909780
7,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,909780,910560
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface,910560,911460
7,"So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this {disfmarker} how they actually programme these things , and if that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,911460,921000
7,Mean {disfmarker},User Interface,921000,922020
7,Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?,Industrial Designer,922020,924840
7,yeah . I mean it {disfmarker} would y would {disfmarker} that would be {disfmarker},Project Manager,924840,929820
7,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,929820,930660
7,"I mean you can do it ,",User Interface,930660,931980
7,They already do it .,Marketing,931980,933180
7,"I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .",Industrial Designer,933180,937620
7,you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote .,User Interface,937620,943500
7,I'm not sure .,Industrial Designer,943500,944340
7,"It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,",User Interface,944340,949320
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,949320,950040
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,950040,950760
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,950760,951480
7,Well they usually are .,Industrial Designer,951480,952860
7,which is a little {disfmarker},User Interface,952860,954660
7,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,954660,955680
7,"My {disfmarker} I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .",User Interface,955680,961020
7,No .,Marketing,961020,961260
7,Huh .,Project Manager,961260,961560
7,But um {disfmarker},User Interface,961560,962700
7,I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,962700,966720
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,966720,967440
7,"So , um {disfmarker} but I mean it's {disfmarker} I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .",User Interface,967440,982560
7,"Yeah , it {disfmarker} most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .",Industrial Designer,982560,996300
7,"Yeah . Yeah . Well so {disfmarker} So , do we need {disfmarker} I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about {disfmarker} But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .",User Interface,996300,1009560
7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1009560,1010040
7,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager,1010040,1010820
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1010820,1011540
7,That's what it does anyway .,User Interface,1011540,1013220
7,"But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you {disfmarker} like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,",Marketing,1013220,1026540
7,Yeah .,User Interface,1026540,1026900

7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1031760,1032480
7,and I never get it .,Marketing,1032480,1033680

7,Yeah .,User Interface,1034040,1034400
7,Never ever .,Marketing,1034400,1035120

7,Well on the telly .,Marketing,1040820,1041960
7,Or on the T_V_ too .,Industrial Designer,1041960,1043160
7,"On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea",User Interface,1043160,1051080
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1051080,1051800
7,"because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .",User Interface,1051800,1065300
7,"Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,",Project Manager,1065300,1068420
7,Mm .,Marketing,1068420,1068660
7,so that fits with the {disfmarker},Project Manager,1068660,1070700
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1070700,1071420
7,"Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are {vocalsound} really hot right now , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,1071420,1077480

7,Did you did you get that pc picture on {disfmarker} did they provide you with that picture on the web ?,Marketing,1077960,1084140

7,"Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,",Industrial Designer,1584180,1588680
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1588680,1589400
7,which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .,Industrial Designer,1589400,1593900

7,I think batteries sound good .,Project Manager,1624320,1626120

7,Oh .,User Interface,1646400,1646640

7,How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said {disfmarker},Project Manager,1749780,1754100
8,Oh .,Project Manager,0,240
8,It's not saved yet .,User Interface,240,1440

8,"Oh , okay . Yeah .",Industrial Designer,17040,18120
8,"So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .",Project Manager,18120,26460
8,Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .,User Interface,26460,33420
8,"Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay .",Project Manager,33420,38340
8,Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .,User Interface,38340,41340
8,"Okay , just {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker}",Project Manager,41340,43920
8,"Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,43920,48900
8,"Yeah , and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .",Industrial Designer,48900,55860
8,Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .,Project Manager,55860,58920
8,"It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you {gap} other functions .",Industrial Designer,58920,65160
8,{vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .,User Interface,65160,68460
8,"Maybe that's better . Yeah , that's that's a very good point .",Project Manager,68460,72180
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,72180,72540
8,"Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside .",User Interface,72540,75300
8,Think that's better .,Industrial Designer,75300,76560
8,So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .,User Interface,76560,81900
8,Yeah . Okay . So this is okay ? {gap},Project Manager,81900,84120
8,"{gap} No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .",User Interface,84120,87600
8,"Okay , so that's {disfmarker} Uh I'll just have a look how much that is .",Project Manager,87600,91980
8,{vocalsound} The {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,91980,93720
8,"But um {disfmarker} Okay , for the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,93720,96540
8,Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .,User Interface,96540,98700
8,Okay .,Project Manager,98700,99060
8,"Yeah , I I think so . I don't know .",Industrial Designer,99060,101220
8,"No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So {disfmarker}",Project Manager,101220,105480
8,Okay .,User Interface,105480,105840
8,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer,105840,106380
8,So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .,Project Manager,106380,110820
8,Good .,User Interface,110820,111180
8,So you can show your prototype if you want to .,Project Manager,111180,114000
8,Together ?,User Interface,114000,114600
8,"Yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Let's do it together .",Industrial Designer,114600,117840
8,I'll give comments .,User Interface,117840,119040
8,"Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . {vocalsound} Uh the material should be hard plastic . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .",Industrial Designer,119040,137400
8,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,137400,137880
8,"And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have {disfmarker} The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel .",Industrial Designer,137880,153000
8,"Okay , cool . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,153000,154560
8,"And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .",Industrial Designer,154560,158820
8,Okay .,Project Manager,158820,159180
8,"And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger .",Industrial Designer,159180,163440
8,Means {disfmarker},Marketing,163440,164520
8,So you hold it like this in your right hand and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,164520,168120
8,Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?,Project Manager,168120,172080
8,{vocalsound},Marketing,172080,172800
8,Speech recognition .,User Interface,172800,174000
8,"Yeah , speech recognition . Just {disfmarker} Only one button to say it's on or off .",Project Manager,174000,179100
8,Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .,User Interface,179100,185820
8,Uh I dunno .,Industrial Designer,185820,186540
8,Um so I've {disfmarker},User Interface,186540,187920
8,"Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .",Industrial Designer,187920,190800
8,"Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .",User Interface,190800,195840
8,So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .,Project Manager,195840,199080
8,"Yeah , you can {gap} put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .",User Interface,199080,202920
8,"Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,202920,205980
8,Okay .,Project Manager,205980,206340
8,That's uh {disfmarker},User Interface,206340,207660
8,"Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .",Industrial Designer,207660,211080
8,Okay .,Marketing,211080,211440
8,"We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But {disfmarker} You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .",User Interface,211440,220020
8,"Yeah , you can put it separate .",Project Manager,220020,221940
8,You {disfmarker} Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So {disfmarker} But it's enough room .,User Interface,221940,229680
8,"Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,229680,233100
8,Uh well {disfmarker},User Interface,233100,234300
8,"You wrote this , so .",Industrial Designer,234300,235560
8,"Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . That was the the most important thing .",User Interface,235560,241260
8,{gap},Marketing,241260,241560
8,"So uh the best {gap} place , the best reach place {disfmarker} Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's {vocalsound} basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .",User Interface,241560,267480
8,"Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .",Industrial Designer,267480,274200
8,Yeah .,User Interface,274200,274560
8,Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine .,Marketing,274560,282000
8,"Okay yeah , they {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface,282000,284100
8,But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .,Marketing,284100,287580
8,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer,287580,288120
8,Yeah okay . That's that's below that then .,User Interface,288120,290700
8,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,290700,291480
8,It's uh twelve buttons .,User Interface,291480,292920
8,{gap} just so you get that .,Industrial Designer,292920,294600
8,"Okay , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's rather important . {vocalsound}",Marketing,294600,298980
8,"Yeah okay , just we just missed that .",User Interface,298980,301260
8,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,301260,302400
8,"But um I'll just uh {disfmarker} I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um {disfmarker} The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .",User Interface,302400,320580
8,Okay .,Project Manager,320580,320940
8,"So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh {vocalsound} in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .",User Interface,320940,340800
8,Okay .,Marketing,340800,341160
8,"And also in the num-pads , there's also colour {gap} light behind it .",User Interface,341160,345360
8,"And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?",Project Manager,345360,350520
8,So when you pre Yeah .,User Interface,350520,351840
8,How do you want to implement that ? Just on the {disfmarker} Maybe on the second level as well ?,Project Manager,351840,357600
8,We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little {disfmarker},User Interface,357600,361380
8,"Yeah , these are just basic functions , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,361380,364680
8,Ah .,Marketing,364680,364920
8,All the non-basic are in {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,364920,367140
8,"Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .",Project Manager,367140,371400
8,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,371400,372540
8,Okay . Um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,372540,373860
8,"Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player .",Marketing,373860,383520
8,"Okay , maybe we use this button for the {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,383520,386640
8,"That function must be {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .",Marketing,386640,394320
8,"Yeah ,",User Interface,394320,394680
8,"Yeah , as well .",Project Manager,394680,395640

8,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface,406500,407640
8,{vocalsound} A second level ?,Industrial Designer,407640,409380
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,409380,409740
8,Like a a new blank one or {disfmarker} Or just here ?,Industrial Designer,409740,412920
8,"No no , just on {disfmarker} Down there .",Project Manager,412920,415380
8,Is i Ah okay .,User Interface,415380,416220
8,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,416220,417300
8,Okay . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,417300,418080
8,And h how does the second level come out ?,Marketing,418080,420600
8,Just uh if you s,Project Manager,420600,421560
8,Uh it slides uh along ?,Marketing,421560,422940
8,Um slides I think .,User Interface,422940,424080
8,"Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .",Project Manager,424080,425460
8,It's,User Interface,425460,425700
8,From from the uh beneath ?,Marketing,425700,427260
8,For the bottom .,Project Manager,427260,428220
8,"You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .",User Interface,428220,432540
8,"No , you gotta slide it .",Project Manager,432540,434040
8,If that breaks then you're screwed .,User Interface,434040,436200
8,"Yeah , it's right .",Project Manager,436200,437340
8,So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um {disfmarker},User Interface,437340,441540

8,"Okay , just give it a two . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,1003980,1006380
8,Yeah . A two . Okay . The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons .,Marketing,1006380,1015020

8,Yeah .,User Interface,1085460,1085820
8,"And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey .",Industrial Designer,1085820,1092720
8,Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent .,User Interface,1092720,1094700

8,"Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,1103700,1107540
8,So I'll give it a {disfmarker},Marketing,1107540,1109340
8,Ye,Project Manager,1109340,1109460
8,"Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so {disfmarker}",Marketing,1109460,1113180

8,Yeah .,User Interface,1115460,1115820
8,It's okay . It's cool .,Project Manager,1115820,1117200
8,"I think it's one . Okay , next .",Marketing,1117200,1119120
8,"This is a difficult one , because we we don't {disfmarker} Yeah , we don't know it about the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1119120,1125420
8,"{vocalsound} Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,1125420,1131120
8,"Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .",Project Manager,1131120,1136460
8,Yeah .,User Interface,1136460,1136820
8,It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker},Project Manager,1136820,1139040
8,"No , but you don't have to use that .",Industrial Designer,1139040,1141260
8,Yeah .,Marketing,1141260,1141620
8,And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .,Industrial Designer,1141620,1145280
8,No .,Project Manager,1145280,1145520
8,That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .,Industrial Designer,1145520,1148940
8,"So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker}",User Interface,1148940,1153860
8,Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .,Marketing,1153860,1157820
8,"Well , I think it is .",Industrial Designer,1157820,1159140
8,"Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .",Marketing,1159140,1168740
8,Well y just uh f,User Interface,1168740,1169700
8,"I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or",Marketing,1169700,1172940
8,"But the rest of it is very easy ,",Project Manager,1172940,1174920
8,{disfmarker} Uh then the re,Marketing,1174920,1176540
8,because there are so so n,Project Manager,1176540,1178040
8,"Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .",User Interface,1178040,1180980
8,So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .,Industrial Designer,1180980,1185960
8,Yes .,User Interface,1185960,1186260
8,Yeah .,Marketing,1186260,1186620
8,"But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .",User Interface,1186620,1191480
8,Okay .,Marketing,1191480,1191840
8,So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .,Project Manager,1191840,1196040
8,Okay .,Marketing,1196040,1196400
8,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker},User Interface,1196400,1199580
8,But {disfmarker},Marketing,1199580,1200540
8,"And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .",Project Manager,1200540,1207560
8,"Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?",Marketing,1207560,1212120
8,Device .,User Interface,1212120,1212600
8,"And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .",Marketing,1212600,1226700
8,But {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,1226700,1228080
8,'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use .,Marketing,1228080,1232460
8,Okay .,User Interface,1232460,1232820
8,Because easy to use comes after learnable .,Marketing,1232820,1235400
8,"Okay , just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool ,",Project Manager,1235400,1238460
8,I I think it a three or something .,Marketing,1238460,1240560
8,so just give it a two .,Project Manager,1240560,1241940
8,Maybe three then . Learnable's {disfmarker},User Interface,1241940,1244520
8,"No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .",Project Manager,1244520,1249560

9,"Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things",Project Manager,770280,778080
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,778080,778560
9,"and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .",Project Manager,778560,787560
9,"{vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .",Marketing,787560,803880
9,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,803880,804360
9,"Mm , okay . S",User Interface,804360,805140
9,"I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}",Project Manager,805140,810840
9,Y,Industrial Designer,810840,810900
9,It might,User Interface,810900,811380
9,Yeah ?,Marketing,811380,811740
9,"it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .",User Interface,811740,817020
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,817020,817500
9,"Yes , no that's important .",Project Manager,817500,819120
9,But it might have its cost implications .,User Interface,819120,821580
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,821580,821940
9,"Yeah , like smaller .",Marketing,821940,823200
9,Okay .,Project Manager,823200,823560
9,"And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?",Marketing,823560,832020
9,Mm .,Project Manager,832020,832260
9,Right .,User Interface,832260,832680
9,Something that's easily moulded and produced .,Marketing,832680,835440
9,Yeah .,Project Manager,835440,835800
9,Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . {vocalsound},Marketing,835800,839160
9,"{vocalsound} Um , right , okay",Project Manager,839160,840960
9,No uh uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,840960,842220
9,"we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .",Project Manager,842220,856800
9,Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,856800,860160
9,Sure .,Project Manager,860160,860520
9,"about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui",Industrial Designer,860520,877680
9,Ah right .,Marketing,877680,878280
9,Okay .,User Interface,878280,878640
9,Okay .,Project Manager,878640,879000
9,Okay .,Marketing,879000,879360
9,I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic,Industrial Designer,879360,882960
9,Sure b y yeah .,Marketing,882960,883860
9,and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,883860,886320
9,"But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point ,",Marketing,886320,892860
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,892860,893220
9,"we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,",Marketing,893220,898080
9,Mm .,Project Manager,898080,898320
9,I presume it would .,Marketing,898320,899520
9,I would {disfmarker},Project Manager,899520,900720
9,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,900720,901500
9,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,901500,902700
9,"it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,",Project Manager,902700,914940
9,Right .,Marketing,914940,915360
9,so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .,Project Manager,915360,918300
9,Okay .,Marketing,918300,918660
9,"Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ?",Project Manager,918660,921180
9,Okay .,Industrial Designer,921180,921540
9,'Kay .,Marketing,921540,921900
9,"So , see you in half an hour .",Project Manager,921900,923700
9,Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?,Marketing,923700,925680
9,"Mm , yeah .",User Interface,925680,926340
9,"I think so , yeah .",Project Manager,926340,927480
10,{vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .,Project Manager,0,5100
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,5100,5820
10,"So ,",Project Manager,5820,6060
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,6060,6540
10,as the previous meeting I will be the secretary,Project Manager,6540,9360
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,9360,9840
10,and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,9840,19560
10,"No y you do the minutes first , or ?",Marketing,19560,21720
10,What ?,Project Manager,21720,22080
10,No ?,Marketing,22080,22320
10,"I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .",Project Manager,22320,27540
10,Okay .,Marketing,27540,27900
10,Yep .,User Interface,27900,28200
10,"So , we'll {disfmarker} S",Project Manager,28200,29700
10,Yeah .,User Interface,29700,30060
10,technical accessoire ?,Project Manager,30060,31380
10,No no no .,User Interface,31380,31980
10,Interface ?,Project Manager,31980,32640
10,Yeah .,User Interface,32640,33000
10,This .,Project Manager,33000,33360
10,"Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um",User Interface,33360,83940
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,83940,84180
10,Mm .,Marketing,84180,84420
10,A nice one .,Industrial Designer,84420,85140
10,"attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .",User Interface,85140,89640
10,{vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .,Project Manager,89640,94500
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,94500,95220
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,95220,95940
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know",User Interface,95940,98340
10,"{vocalsound} It's very big ,",Project Manager,98340,100020
10,if you're {disfmarker},User Interface,100020,101340
10,{vocalsound} yeah .,Project Manager,101340,102480
10,Yeah .,User Interface,102480,102840
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,102840,103560
10,"It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,",User Interface,103560,108480
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,108480,109200
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,109200,111120
10,yeah .,User Interface,111120,111480
10,"Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,111480,113220
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,113220,114000
10,"We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,",Project Manager,114000,116880
10,{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,116880,119220
10,so .,Project Manager,119220,119460
10,Yeah .,User Interface,119460,119820
10,Mm .,Marketing,119820,120060
10,"So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,",User Interface,120060,125280
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,125280,125760
10,Mm .,Marketing,125760,126000
10,"so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .",User Interface,126000,145560
10,Okay . Something else ?,Project Manager,145560,146940
10,Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .,User Interface,146940,151560
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,151560,151920
10,"I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,",Project Manager,151920,161280
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,161280,162060
10,"but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?",Project Manager,162060,171900
10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,171900,173220
10,"Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?",Project Manager,173220,181860
10,Y,User Interface,181860,181920
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,181920,182640
10,{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .,Industrial Designer,182640,184260
10,"or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?",Project Manager,184260,192120
10,Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .,User Interface,192120,198540
10,"Yeah , sure .",Project Manager,198540,199320
10,"For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .",User Interface,199320,208380
10,I,Project Manager,208380,208440
10,"Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so .",Industrial Designer,208440,213000
10,That's true . {vocalsound},Project Manager,213000,214560
10,One and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,214560,215760
10,"Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .",Project Manager,215760,220020
10,Yeah .,User Interface,220020,220380
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,220380,221100
10,Mm .,Marketing,221100,221340
10,So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . {vocalsound},User Interface,221340,225060
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,225060,225780
10,Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?,Marketing,225780,232140
10,Broken arm ?,Project Manager,232140,232860
10,For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker},User Interface,232860,240840
10,Okay . Okay .,Marketing,240840,241620
10,"Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?",Project Manager,241620,254040
10,Yeah .,User Interface,254040,254400
10,{vocalsound} Yep . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,254400,256260
10,But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway .,Marketing,256260,260040
10,Why ?,Project Manager,260040,260340
10,"Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .",User Interface,260340,262920
10,If you have one brother and one sister,Project Manager,262920,265200
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Marketing,265200,266220
10,"and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,",Project Manager,266220,269700
10,"Yeah , but the {disfmarker}",Marketing,269700,271320
10,"so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,",Project Manager,271320,276300
10,{vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah,Industrial Designer,276300,278640
10,"Yeah , it's very interesting . {vocalsound}",User Interface,278640,281220
10,Yeah but this {disfmarker},Marketing,281220,282780
10,so .,Project Manager,282780,283020
10,but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control,Industrial Designer,283020,287400
10,Yeah .,Marketing,287400,287760
10,because the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,287760,289200
10,Yeah .,User Interface,289200,289560
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,289560,289920
10,I don't think it {disfmarker},Marketing,289920,291660
10,"but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .",Project Manager,291660,295920
10,{vocalsound} That's right .,Industrial Designer,295920,297540
10,You're not you're not obliged to share it .,Project Manager,297540,300120
10,"Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .",Marketing,300120,304560
10,"Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,304560,306540
10,"Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,",User Interface,306540,315180
10,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,315180,318420
10,No .,Marketing,318420,318660
10,"so it's c come to channel three ,",User Interface,318660,320640
10,"No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .",Marketing,320640,323100
10,I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface,323100,325560
10,"Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .",Project Manager,325560,327720
10,It's advantage .,User Interface,327720,328680
10,Yeah .,Marketing,328680,329040
10,And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to,Industrial Designer,329040,334260
10,"Yeah , but one other question .",Project Manager,334260,336120
10,"manual controllers , eh .",Industrial Designer,336120,337620
10,How how much will it cost ?,Project Manager,337620,339240
10,"No , more expensive maybe .",Industrial Designer,339240,340860
10,How much ?,User Interface,340860,341460
10,Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .,Project Manager,341460,345960
10,No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker},User Interface,345960,348840
10,Some some efficient .,Project Manager,348840,350100
10,Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker},Marketing,350100,352860
10,"No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .",User Interface,352860,360360
10,So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ? Or ?,Project Manager,360360,364320
10,"Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}",User Interface,364320,373320
10,"Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,373320,375060
10,it's uh {disfmarker} yeah . It's {disfmarker},User Interface,375060,377760
10,"But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .",Marketing,377760,388260
10,"Well y y you have also the language problem ,",Industrial Designer,388260,390960
10,No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface,390960,396840
10,you know when you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,396840,398640
10,Mm-mm .,Project Manager,398640,399060
10,"'Cause it it have to be universal ,",Industrial Designer,399060,401160
10,Yeah . I agree with uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,401160,403260
10,so .,Industrial Designer,403260,403500
10,"The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .",User Interface,403500,406860
10,Yeah .,Marketing,406860,407220
10,"Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international",Project Manager,407220,411900
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,411900,413040
10,Yeah .,User Interface,413040,413400
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,413400,414120
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,414120,414840
10,remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .,Project Manager,414840,421800
10,Yeah .,User Interface,421800,422160
10,"The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,",Project Manager,422160,429900
10,Yeah .,User Interface,429900,430260
10,so .,Project Manager,430260,430500
10,"Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation",User Interface,430500,438480
10,"Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}",Marketing,438480,442440
10,Yeah but you know . The product {disfmarker} The pro,Industrial Designer,442440,445560
10,mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .,User Interface,445560,456240
10,"{vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,456240,461040
10,"Mm , okay .",Project Manager,461040,461700
10,Yeah .,Marketing,461700,462060
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",User Interface,462060,463200
10,And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?,Project Manager,463200,467520
10,it's {disfmarker},User Interface,467520,468540
10,Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,468540,471000
10,Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .,User Interface,471000,475260
10,"Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}",Project Manager,475260,477420
10,So {disfmarker},User Interface,477420,478320
10,"Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .",Industrial Designer,478320,488040
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,488040,488820
10,"If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .",Industrial Designer,488820,492720
10,Mm .,Marketing,492720,492960
10,"Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .",User Interface,492960,496980
10,"Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,",Industrial Designer,496980,499860
10,Yeah .,User Interface,499860,500220
10,because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,500220,502980
10,Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker},User Interface,502980,509940
10,Oh really ? {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,509940,513360
10,Oh .,Project Manager,513360,513600
10,"Yeah ,",Marketing,513600,513960
10,Seems to be quite complex .,Project Manager,513960,515580
10,"but then w Yeah ,",Marketing,515580,516600
10,Comple,Industrial Designer,516600,516960
10,"No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} .",User Interface,516960,519300
10,we have to take care of the twelve Euros,Marketing,519300,521700
10,"And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?",Project Manager,521700,525240
10,problem .,Marketing,525240,525780
10,And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?,Project Manager,525780,530640
10,No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller .,User Interface,530640,541980
10,"Yeah , but where is the controller ?",Project Manager,541980,544140
10,Okay .,Marketing,544140,544500
10,Where is the controller ?,User Interface,544500,546000
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,546000,546360
10,"It's in your family , in your home . {vocalsound}",User Interface,546360,549300
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,549300,550020
10,"Yeah , but we're {disfmarker}",Project Manager,550020,551760
10,"No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,551760,554700
10,here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .,Project Manager,554700,559320
10,Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .,User Interface,559320,562740
10,A microphone maybe .,Industrial Designer,562740,563940
10,"Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .",Project Manager,563940,576480
10,To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .,Industrial Designer,576480,578520
10,You just want to interact with television .,Project Manager,578520,581100
10,"Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you",User Interface,581100,585360
10,"I if you say one , he switch to channel ,",Industrial Designer,585360,587820
10,you use your command,User Interface,587820,589020
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,589020,590160
10,yeah .,Industrial Designer,590160,590520
10,and you do s your gesture .,User Interface,590520,592140
10,but you can lose it . {vocalsound},Project Manager,592140,594180
10,No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker},User Interface,594180,598260
10,So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .,Industrial Designer,598260,610620
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,610620,611340
10,Yeah .,User Interface,611340,611700
10,Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box,Project Manager,611700,615180
10,Devic,Industrial Designer,615180,615480
10,and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .,Project Manager,615480,619140
10,Yeah .,Marketing,619140,619500
10,Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control .,Industrial Designer,619500,626160
10,Ah .,Project Manager,626160,626400
10,Yeah .,User Interface,626400,626760
10,But you would still have the buttons . Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?,Marketing,626760,638160
10,think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker},User Interface,638160,643740
10,"Okay , so you {disfmarker}",Marketing,643740,645300
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,645300,645660
10,yeah .,User Interface,645660,646020
10,yeah .,Marketing,646020,646380
10,You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another .,User Interface,646380,650640
10,Mm .,Project Manager,650640,650880
10,"Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .",Marketing,650880,653340
10,I think so .,Project Manager,653340,654060
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,654060,654420
10,"No ,",User Interface,654420,654660
10,And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker},Project Manager,654660,657000
10,that's quite inter quite attractive .,User Interface,657000,659220
10,"But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y",Industrial Designer,659220,666360
10,"Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . {vocalsound}",User Interface,666360,671160
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Marketing,671160,672300
10,Yeah but i i {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,672300,673800
10,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager,673800,675720
10,I dunno .,Marketing,675720,676260
10,We should have confidence in technology . {vocalsound},User Interface,676260,679500
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , we should . {vocalsound} Uh .",Industrial Designer,679500,682440
10,"Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .",Project Manager,682440,686700
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,686700,686940
10,What ?,Marketing,686940,687300
10,"Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?",Project Manager,687300,692160
10,"If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .",Marketing,692160,698520
10,"More features , yeah .",User Interface,698520,699840
10,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,699840,701220
10,But if if if it like doubles uh,Marketing,701220,703080
10,"I think he need a control that is very reliable ,",Industrial Designer,703080,706020
10,no one would would be interested .,Marketing,706020,708060
10,so .,Industrial Designer,708060,708300
10,So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?,Project Manager,708300,720360
10,{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,720360,721920
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,721920,722640
10,"Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?",Project Manager,722640,732480
10,"Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?",User Interface,732480,750240
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,750240,751380
10,"Yeah . No ,",Marketing,751380,752040
10,Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker},User Interface,752040,760860
10,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing,760860,762000
10,It's not really the {disfmarker} we,Industrial Designer,762000,764100
10,Y,Marketing,764100,764160
10,"we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that . But uh I think a user need {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,764160,773100
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,",User Interface,773100,784260
10,"No ,",Marketing,784260,784500
10,but {disfmarker},User Interface,784500,785460
10,"but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,",Marketing,785460,793680
10,Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah,Industrial Designer,793680,796740
10,Okay .,User Interface,796740,797100
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing,797100,798000
10,if we can send email from it .,Industrial Designer,798000,799800
10,"But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .",User Interface,799800,807540
10,No . No .,Marketing,807540,808080
10,Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,808080,816480
10,Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing,816480,818700
10,"Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,",User Interface,818700,825300
10,Yeah .,Marketing,825300,825660
10,"Yeah , but uh we want so",Project Manager,825660,827100
10,"but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .",User Interface,827100,840600
10,"Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker}",Marketing,840600,842820
10,That's {disfmarker},User Interface,842820,843960
10,True .,Marketing,843960,844320
10,"the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products .",User Interface,844320,852660
10,"Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .",Project Manager,852660,858780
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,858780,859800
10,Yeah .,User Interface,859800,860160
10,"{vocalsound} And for all the person of the family maybe ,",Industrial Designer,860160,863580
10,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,863580,864900
10,You don't need to tune it .,Project Manager,864900,866520
10,"so , yeah .",Industrial Designer,866520,867180
10,"Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?",User Interface,867180,875880
10,"Yeah , why not ? If it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,875880,878100
10,"I mean , for example the goo y",Marketing,878100,879900
10,Because you have new {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,879900,881880
10,you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .,Marketing,881880,885480
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,885480,886260
10,"I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine ,",Marketing,886260,895500
10,Yeah .,User Interface,895500,895860
10,"so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .",Marketing,895860,902400
10,"Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .",User Interface,902400,907320
10,"Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition",Marketing,907320,913620
10,The {disfmarker} then nn,User Interface,913620,915060
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing,915060,915960
10,no .,User Interface,915960,916200
10,"if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .",Marketing,916200,923580
10,Tha,User Interface,923580,923760
10,Not too expensive too .,Project Manager,923760,925140
10,But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .,User Interface,925140,934920
10,See {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Marketing,934920,936660
10,That's the same {disfmarker},User Interface,936660,938340
10,"That's the problem ,",Marketing,938340,939540
10,yeah .,User Interface,939540,939900
10,"yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .",Marketing,939900,946860
10,{vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,946860,948540
10,Yeah .,User Interface,948540,948900
10,"But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product",Marketing,948900,953040
10,Yeah .,User Interface,953040,953400
10,and so .,Marketing,953400,953880
10,Okay . So,Project Manager,953880,954420
10,"I mean , that's the point .",Marketing,954420,956040
10,let's go to the Industrial Designer .,Project Manager,956040,958260
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,958260,958980
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,958980,959340
10,Okay .,User Interface,959340,959700
10,"Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .",Project Manager,959700,963060
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,963060,963420
10,Yeah .,User Interface,963420,963780
10,Two ?,Project Manager,963780,964080
10,"Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,964080,966360
10,Working ?,Project Manager,966360,966900
10,"Yeah , working design ,",Industrial Designer,966900,968280
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,968280,969000
10,so .,Industrial Designer,969000,969240
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,969240,969960
10,So I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,969960,971340
10,I can {disfmarker},Project Manager,971340,972420
10,Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ? I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one .,Industrial Designer,972420,977160
10,Okay .,Project Manager,977160,977520
10,It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,977520,980520
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing,980520,982020
10,It's the working design . Sorry . {vocalsound} Component design .,Industrial Designer,982020,985920
10,It's okay {vocalsound},Project Manager,985920,987240
10,So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,987240,991260
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,991260,991980
10,What ? Are you inst,Industrial Designer,991980,993120
10,Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker},Project Manager,993120,996540
10,It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .,User Interface,996540,999420
10,Maybe you you record it somewhere else .,Project Manager,999420,1001820
10,I don't think so .,Industrial Designer,1001820,1002900
10,Participant one . Participant one .,User Interface,1002900,1005000
10,Interface concept . No .,Project Manager,1005000,1006440
10,Hmm .,Marketing,1006440,1006740
10,Mm mm .,Project Manager,1006740,1007160
10,Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer .,Industrial Designer,1007160,1011240
10,Yeah .,Marketing,1011240,1011600
10,Uh . {vocalsound} Nope . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1011600,1013820
10,Dunno .,Marketing,1013820,1014240
10,"Okay , okay . Yes .",Industrial Designer,1014240,1015380
10,It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker},Project Manager,1015380,1018560
10,I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker},Marketing,1018560,1022100
10,I can say it to you without .,Industrial Designer,1022100,1023840
10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1023840,1025160
10,"Yeah , maybe we can first come to",User Interface,1025160,1027140
10,"No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1027140,1031340
10,"uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,",User Interface,1031340,1035120
10,"I think it's more interesting what he says ,",Marketing,1035120,1037760
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,1037760,1038120
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,1038120,1039260
10,then present it later .,User Interface,1039260,1040640
10,okay .,Marketing,1040640,1041000
10,exac,Industrial Designer,1041000,1041240
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,1041240,1041960
10,You will had s some more information in {disfmarker},Project Manager,1041960,1045080
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1045080,1045440
10,I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .,Project Manager,1045440,1050660
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1050660,1051020
10,"Yeah , true .",Marketing,1051020,1051800
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1051800,1052940
10,Okay . {vocalsound},User Interface,1052940,1054080
10,"In fact , I don't know ,",Industrial Designer,1054080,1055520
10,So . Okay .,Project Manager,1055520,1056180
10,I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1056180,1060260
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,1060260,1060980
10,"Okay , never mind .",Project Manager,1060980,1062120
10,so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r,Industrial Designer,1062120,1071060
10,Okay .,User Interface,1071060,1071420
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,1071420,1072140
10,of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside,Industrial Designer,1072140,1078440
10,Okay . Okay .,User Interface,1078440,1079220
10,"and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,",Industrial Designer,1079220,1087980
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1087980,1088460
10,"so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,",Industrial Designer,1088460,1100460
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1100460,1100940
10,"so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,",Industrial Designer,1100940,1111680
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1111680,1112160
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1112160,1112640
10,"or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .",Industrial Designer,1112640,1115640
10,Okay .,Project Manager,1115640,1116000
10,Okay .,User Interface,1116000,1116360
10,"And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation",Industrial Designer,1116360,1127040
10,Uh-huh .,User Interface,1127040,1127520
10,"or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come",Industrial Designer,1127520,1157160
10,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1157160,1158180
10,"and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .",Industrial Designer,1158180,1167420
10,"Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control",Project Manager,1167420,1170780
10,"Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .",Industrial Designer,1170780,1172160
10,and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers,Project Manager,1172160,1175760
10,"Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1175760,1178580
10,Yeah . Yeah .,Marketing,1178580,1179360
10,"and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,",Project Manager,1179360,1187580
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1187580,1188300
10,no ?,Project Manager,1188300,1188540
10,"Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,",Industrial Designer,1188540,1201320
10,So .,Project Manager,1201320,1201560
10,"but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,",Industrial Designer,1201560,1205220
10,Yeah .,Marketing,1205220,1205580
10,Okay .,Project Manager,1205580,1205940
10,so hmm .,Industrial Designer,1205940,1206420
10,And what tha what about the uh materials ?,Project Manager,1206420,1208940
10,"And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common",Industrial Designer,1208940,1218120
10,"Impersonal , mm-hmm .",Project Manager,1218120,1219380
10,"it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,",Industrial Designer,1219380,1226280
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,1226280,1226640
10,Special for {disfmarker},Marketing,1226640,1228080
10,"or you know , you can have some {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1228080,1230720
10,"Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .",Project Manager,1230720,1237620
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,1237620,1238100
10,"Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood",Industrial Designer,1238100,1244280
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1244280,1244760
10,Yeah .,Marketing,1244760,1245120
10,Mm-hmm . Mm .,Project Manager,1245120,1245900
10,and it can be interesting .,Industrial Designer,1245900,1247520
10,"Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .",Project Manager,1247520,1249920
10,"And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .",Industrial Designer,1249920,1264740
10,"Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .",Project Manager,1264740,1271760
10,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1271760,1273380
10,And you think that we will be {disfmarker},Project Manager,1273380,1275900
10,"Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,",Industrial Designer,1275900,1280040
10,Okay .,Project Manager,1280040,1280400
10,so .,Industrial Designer,1280400,1280640
10,So wood .,Project Manager,1280640,1281180
10,{gap},Industrial Designer,1281180,1281480
10,And what about the buttons ?,Project Manager,1281480,1283160
10,"I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion",Industrial Designer,1283160,1294980
10,"No it's fashion , yeah .",Project Manager,1294980,1296420
10,"and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .",Industrial Designer,1296420,1309380
10,What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .,Marketing,1309380,1314480
10,{vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .,Industrial Designer,1314480,1320360
10,Mm .,Marketing,1320360,1320600
10,"But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1320600,1327860
10,Yeah .,Marketing,1327860,1328220
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1328220,1328940
10,So you got email ?,User Interface,1328940,1330020
10,I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .,Project Manager,1330020,1335540
10,Okay .,Marketing,1335540,1335900
10,Participant four ? Functional requirements ?,Project Manager,1335900,1338540
10,"Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}",Marketing,1338540,1342500
10,This one ?,Project Manager,1342500,1343100
10,"Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .",Marketing,1343100,1360860
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1360860,1361580
10,"So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically",Marketing,1361580,1381020
10,Mm .,User Interface,1381020,1381260
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1381260,1381500
10,"but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .",Marketing,1381500,1394700
10,Okay .,Project Manager,1394700,1395060
10,"At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .",Marketing,1395060,1402920
10,{gap},Industrial Designer,1402920,1403220
10,"Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,",Marketing,1403220,1414860
10,Ah yes .,Industrial Designer,1414860,1415340
10,"okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .",Marketing,1415340,1420860
10,"Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1420860,1422480
10,"'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .",Marketing,1422480,1448280
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1448280,1448640
10,"So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris",Marketing,1448640,1456680
10,And fruit and vegetables yeah .,Industrial Designer,1456680,1458540
10,"we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,",Marketing,1458540,1465920
10,{vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .,Industrial Designer,1465920,1468260
10,okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .,Marketing,1468260,1472460
10,"Okay , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1472460,1473660
10,I dunno .,Marketing,1473660,1474200
10,"Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?",Industrial Designer,1474200,1478880
10,Yeah thi this is this would be like um,Marketing,1478880,1481160
10,Pla S,Industrial Designer,1481160,1481460
10,"plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh",Marketing,1481460,1485420
10,"Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .",Industrial Designer,1485420,1489620
10,"device , so um",Marketing,1489620,1490460
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1490460,1490820
10,"Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .",Marketing,1490820,1495500
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1495500,1495860
10,"So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,",Project Manager,1495860,1510440
10,Yeah . Solar .,Industrial Designer,1510440,1511280
10,"Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}",Marketing,1511280,1513680
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1513680,1514040
10,maybe will attract,Project Manager,1514040,1515120
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1515120,1515480
10,Mm-hmm,Marketing,1515480,1515840
10,It will be a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1515840,1517340
10,pro-ecology consumers .,Project Manager,1517340,1518720
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1518720,1519080
10,Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .,Project Manager,1519080,1525380
10,"Yeah , I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . Yeah .",Industrial Designer,1525380,1529040
10,Case .,Project Manager,1529040,1529400
10,Later ? {vocalsound},User Interface,1529400,1530600
10,So you think {gap} case . Something spongy . {vocalsound} Someth no wood .,Project Manager,1530600,1535040
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1535040,1535760
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,1535760,1536480
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,1536480,1537200
10,{vocalsound} No wood but {disfmarker} Plastic ?,Industrial Designer,1537200,1540020
10,"Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .",Marketing,1540020,1544580
10,Would some {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1544580,1545960
10,Pla,User Interface,1545960,1546140
10,Maybe you {disfmarker},Project Manager,1546140,1547460
10,"I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want ,",Industrial Designer,1547460,1553580
10,"Yeah , maybe the base .",Marketing,1553580,1554960
10,so .,Industrial Designer,1554960,1555200
10,It's it's natural .,Project Manager,1555200,1556340
10,But still y,Marketing,1556340,1557000
10,"Th The feeling is natural ,",Project Manager,1557000,1558620
10,"Yeah , it's natural",Industrial Designer,1558620,1559760
10,Yeah .,Marketing,1559760,1560120
10,and i,Industrial Designer,1560120,1560420
10,so maybe we can stay with wood .,Project Manager,1560420,1562340
10,"And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol",Industrial Designer,1562340,1569180
10,"Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .",Marketing,1569180,1573200
10,"Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .",Industrial Designer,1573200,1575180
10,But it's still fashion .,Project Manager,1575180,1576620
10,"But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,",Marketing,1576620,1581420
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1581420,1581780
10,or,Marketing,1581780,1581900
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,1581900,1582260
10,I dunno .,Marketing,1582260,1582800
10,something that you can {vocalsound} into it .,Project Manager,1582800,1585500
10,Yeah .,Marketing,1585500,1585860
10,Uh and what about the user interface concept ?,Project Manager,1585860,1588620
10,{vocalsound} Google and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1588620,1590780
10,Google and fancy ?,Project Manager,1590780,1591860
10,"and fancy , f how about the the voice ? {vocalsound} And {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,1591860,1596000
10,Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .,Project Manager,1596000,1602360
10,Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested,Industrial Designer,1602360,1606980
10,Uh yes .,User Interface,1606980,1607460
10,and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control .,Industrial Designer,1607460,1614360
10,Yeah .,Marketing,1614360,1614720
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,1614720,1615500
10,Mm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1615500,1616160
10,The smart controller . {vocalsound},User Interface,1616160,1618260
10,"But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,",Industrial Designer,1618260,1630620
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,1630620,1631760
10,so .,Industrial Designer,1631760,1632000
10,but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .,Project Manager,1632000,1635900
10,"But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .",Industrial Designer,1635900,1640220
10,That's true .,Project Manager,1640220,1641000
10,Yeah {disfmarker} d,Marketing,1641000,1642140
10,Okay .,User Interface,1642140,1642500
10,"So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,",Project Manager,1642500,1647180
10,I dunno .,Marketing,1647180,1647720
10,Mm .,User Interface,1647720,1647960
10,"maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .",Project Manager,1647960,1657500
10,Yeah . It's good .,User Interface,1657500,1658580
10,And L_C_D_ buttons .,Project Manager,1658580,1659780
10,"Yeah , L_C_D_ .",Industrial Designer,1659780,1660680
10,"Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .",Project Manager,1660680,1668300
10,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1668300,1672740
10,What interface ?,Marketing,1672740,1673700
10,"Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value .",Project Manager,1673700,1677360
10,"I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1677360,1686120
10,With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use,Project Manager,1686120,1691520
10,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,1691520,1692300
10,"commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .",Project Manager,1692300,1696560
10,Yeah . Mm .,Industrial Designer,1696560,1697220
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1697220,1697700
10,"To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .",Industrial Designer,1697700,1704600
10,Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .,Project Manager,1704600,1706520
10,"Yeah , turning {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,",Industrial Designer,1706520,1712640
10,"So ,",Project Manager,1712640,1712880
10,so .,Industrial Designer,1712880,1713120
10,adding some vocal commands .,Project Manager,1713120,1714800
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1714800,1715160
10,Simple ones ?,Project Manager,1715160,1715940
10,"Yeah , simple ones for {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1715940,1718040
10,"Okay . {vocalsound} So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} we'll {disfmarker} you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .",Project Manager,1718040,1739580
10,Yeah .,User Interface,1739580,1739940

10,"{vocalsound} expensive buttons {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , to make some new {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1748160,1753320
10,and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .,Project Manager,1753320,1757280
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1757280,1758420
10,{vocalsound} And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .,Project Manager,1758420,1762860

11,Okay .,Project Manager,108180,108540
11,"Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .",Marketing,108540,158640
11,Hm .,Project Manager,158640,158880
11,"Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .",Marketing,158880,258000

11,Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user .

11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,302100,302820
11,"And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .",User Interface,302820,392820

11,Right .,Industrial Designer,398100,398520
11,Oh .,Marketing,398520,398760
11,"Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .

11,"You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker}",Project Manager,981480,996720
11,"Oh okay , yeah .",Marketing,996720,997680
11,It seems like that would be hard though .,User Interface,997680,1000140
11,But {disfmarker},Project Manager,1000140,1001100
11,"I mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker}",User Interface,1001100,1004100
11,It might be confusing . Yeah .,Project Manager,1004100,1005900
11,yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't {disfmarker} I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound},User Interface,1005900,1013760
11,Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .,Project Manager,1013760,1016640
11,"Yeah , I never think to hold something down . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,1016640,1020120
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1020120,1020480
11,{vocalsound} I have the power {vocalsound},Project Manager,1020480,1023000
11,Yeah . B {vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,1023000,1024680
11,I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .,Project Manager,1024680,1028760
11,Yeah .,User Interface,1028760,1029120
11,"Well even um iPod thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of",Marketing,1029120,1041000
11,"That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .",User Interface,1041000,1044120
11,scrolling {disfmarker} I don't know .,Marketing,1044120,1046340
11,Mm . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1046340,1047360
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1047360,1048080
11,Yeah . Because people li seem {disfmarker} now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no {disfmarker} Know you don't have one two three four five {disfmarker},Marketing,1048080,1058760
11,"Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,",User Interface,1058760,1062900
11,Mm .,Project Manager,1062900,1063140
11,"it's it's funny like you f like I just {disfmarker} I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and {disfmarker} it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .",User Interface,1063140,1082880
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,1082880,1083240
11,"Yeah yeah , it's just {disfmarker} and it's one thing which has everything .",Marketing,1083240,1087800

11,Well can't it tell the {disfmarker} like can't you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker},Marketing,1095600,1100580
11,"Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .",Industrial Designer,1100580,1104120
11,Yeah . Okay .,User Interface,1104120,1104900
11,you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker},Marketing,1104900,1111440
11,Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .,User Interface,1111440,1115400
11,Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,1115400,1120860
11,Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .,User Interface,1120860,1126980
11,okay . I've never used one . No .,Project Manager,1126980,1128960

11,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager,1132800,1133580
11,Yeah . Yeah and then .,User Interface,1133580,1134900
11,"And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .",Marketing,1134900,1146180
11,Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker},User Interface,1146180,1155420
11,"Yeah , you can {disfmarker}",Marketing,1155420,1157040
11,Well i,Project Manager,1157040,1157400
11,zap .,User Interface,1157400,1157700
11,"Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker}",Marketing,1157700,1160880
11,Okay .,User Interface,1160880,1161240
11,"We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .",Project Manager,1161240,1171080
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1171080,1171440
11,Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom {disfmarker} So do you need to {disfmarker},User Interface,1171440,1177440
11,"Doesn't it rotate though ,",Industrial Designer,1177440,1179000
11,okay .,User Interface,1179000,1179360
11,so it'll be moving around .,Industrial Designer,1179360,1180980
11,Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker},User Interface,1180980,1186560
11,What do you mean the function ?,Marketing,1186560,1188420
11,"I mean like okay , 'cause so {disfmarker} I dunno , I guess {disfmarker} Okay {disfmarker} so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .",User Interface,1188420,1206120
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1206120,1206480
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1206480,1206960
11,But then {disfmarker},User Interface,1206960,1208220
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1208220,1208580
11,"so if you wanna switch to the {disfmarker} to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .",User Interface,1208580,1224780
11,Yeah but it knows for some reason .,Marketing,1224780,1226880
11,It just {disfmarker},User Interface,1226880,1228080
11,The iPod knows .,Marketing,1228080,1229040

11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1232400,1233120

11,{vocalsound},Marketing,1236180,1236900
11,Huh .,Project Manager,1236900,1237200
11,Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .,User Interface,1237200,1242600
11,I don't have one .,Industrial Designer,1242600,1243680
11,"Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .",Marketing,1243680,1247700
11,"Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .",User Interface,1247700,1255500
11,Oh .,Industrial Designer,1255500,1255740
11,So it's like holding {disfmarker},Project Manager,1255740,1257720
11,"And then {disfmarker} well if you do that it goes , but if you {disfmarker} like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .",Marketing,1257720,1267980
11,You can {disfmarker} o And you you {disfmarker} is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually {disfmarker} you're just using the mouse to go up and down .,Project Manager,1267980,1277700
11,Well what you {disfmarker},Marketing,1277700,1279260
11,Like {disfmarker},Project Manager,1279260,1280280
11,It's like a b,User Interface,1280280,1281060
11,"for the iPod you press an {disfmarker} w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .",Marketing,1281060,1292880
11,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1292880,1294920
11,"But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker}",Marketing,1294920,1299780
11,"Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?",Project Manager,1299780,1306680
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1306680,1307040
11,Like you could just have {disfmarker},Project Manager,1307040,1309260
11,"I don't know ,",Marketing,1309260,1310100
11,"Oh , like {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1310100,1311420

11,Like {disfmarker},User Interface,1316220,1317240
11,but I think {disfmarker},Marketing,1317240,1318680
11,I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .,User Interface,1318680,1322760
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,1322760,1323720
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,1323720,1324080
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,1324080,1325220

11,Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker},Project Manager,1332120,1335960

11,I don't think it's the wheel dealy .,Industrial Designer,1345260,1347420
11,I think it {disfmarker},Marketing,1347420,1348800
11,Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they {disfmarker} it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .,Project Manager,1348800,1356600
11,Okay .,User Interface,1356600,1356960
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1356960,1357320
11,Yeah . {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,1357320,1358580
11,Yeah . I'm thinking we could {disfmarker} if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .,User Interface,1358580,1365780
11,And they're re-programmable aren't they ?,Industrial Designer,1365780,1368240

11,Yeah .,User Interface,1377180,1377540
11,S,Project Manager,1377540,1377600
11,"Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker}",User Interface,1377600,1391640
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1391640,1392000
11,Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1392000,1393260
11,"Yeah yeah yeah . Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation {vocalsound} , is that people find it {disfmarker} find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote",Marketing,1393260,1409160
11,Yeah .,User Interface,1409160,1409520
11,and that's another thing they complained about .,Marketing,1409520,1412400
11,Mm .,Project Manager,1412400,1412640
11,Yeah .,User Interface,1412640,1413000

11,Channel selection .,Marketing,1418640,1419780
11,"This is just for T_V_ , it's not for {disfmarker} or it is {disfmarker} does need to be compatible with {disfmarker}",User Interface,1419780,1426740
11,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,1426740,1427640
11,"I {disfmarker} A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,",Industrial Designer,1427640,1431960
11,Yeah .,User Interface,1431960,1432320
11,"You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .",Project Manager,1432320,1442220
11,So how do you switch {disfmarker},User Interface,1442220,1444200
11,Menu .,Marketing,1444200,1444560
11,and menu maybe . Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer,1444560,1446120
11,So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker},Project Manager,1446120,1449900
11,Okay . So like if we had that {disfmarker},User Interface,1449900,1452420
11,But we'll hold off on that 'cause {disfmarker},Project Manager,1452420,1455180
11,Yeah .,User Interface,1455180,1455540
11,But s yeah uh .,Project Manager,1455540,1456440
11,But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .,Marketing,1456440,1459440
11,"That's true , yeah .",User Interface,1459440,1460640
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,1460640,1461000
11,"So , I know I'm not c really clear on what {disfmarker}",User Interface,1461000,1464300
11,"But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .",Industrial Designer,1464300,1474260
11,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,1474260,1475040
11,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,1475040,1476240
11,Mm . Mm .,Project Manager,1476240,1476780
11,So you'd have to have like {disfmarker},User Interface,1476780,1479120
11,Yeah .,Marketing,1479120,1479480
11,"I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So {disfmarker}",User Interface,1479480,1492620
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,1492620,1492980
11,Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .,Industrial Designer,1492980,1495560
11,"Yeah ,",User Interface,1495560,1495920
11,"Yeah , it is only fun",Marketing,1495920,1497180

11,But i Yeah .,Project Manager,1503660,1504380
11,Oh . But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1504380,1512060
11,Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker},User Interface,1512060,1515000
11,but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .,Industrial Designer,1515000,1520340
11,"So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that ,",User Interface,1520340,1544940
11,"Um , yeah , let's think about it",Project Manager,1544940,1546860
11,that like {disfmarker},User Interface,1546860,1548180
11,Yes we can try that .,Industrial Designer,1548180,1549440

Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . {vocalsound} The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .",Marketing,99180,166140
12,Hmm .,User Interface,166140,166440
12,"But um {vocalsound} this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .",Marketing,166440,174900
12,But we already have the flashing flashing light on the {disfmarker},Project Manager,174900,178920
12,{vocalsound} Uh maybe maybe something new .,Marketing,178920,181500
12,"Yeah , more .",User Interface,181500,182280
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,182280,182580
12,"We have to discuss about it s uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh {gap}",Marketing,182580,186240
12,Okay .,Project Manager,186240,186600
12,"Well , I'll I'll get back on it .",User Interface,186600,188580
12,features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .,Marketing,188580,208140
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,208140,208500
12,"So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .",Marketing,208500,225720
12,Hmm .,Project Manager,225720,226020
12,"But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .",Marketing,226020,233400
12,Spongy .,User Interface,233400,233880
12,"But spongy , what what does spongy says ?",Marketing,233880,236340
12,Spongy .,Industrial Designer,236340,236820
12,"Spongy , like sponge .",User Interface,236820,238140
12,Spongy . Okay . {vocalsound},Marketing,238140,239820
12,"So rubber , kind of .",Industrial Designer,239820,241080
12,Uh soft materials .,User Interface,241080,242220
12,"But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,",Project Manager,242220,245040
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,245040,245400
12,because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be {vocalsound} flexible .,Project Manager,245400,252540
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface,252540,254340
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,254340,255060
12,"Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .",Marketing,255060,262260
12,It's like a sponge .,Industrial Designer,262260,263460
12,"Soft , sponge .",User Interface,263460,264360
12,So it's also a stress-ball .,Marketing,264360,266040
12,"That's a good {disfmarker} That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea .",Project Manager,266040,271920
12,"Yeah , somewhat like {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,271920,273900
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface,273900,275700
12,Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ?,Project Manager,275700,279300
12,How are you gonna make it ?,User Interface,279300,280920
12,R_ soft .,Project Manager,280920,281460
12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,281460,281820
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,281820,282720
12,"I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .",Industrial Designer,282720,287880
12,Okay .,Project Manager,287880,288240
12,Okay ?,Marketing,288240,288600
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,288600,289320
12,"What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .",Marketing,289320,297600
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,297600,297960
12,Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .,Marketing,297960,302400
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,302400,303120
12,"And uh some basic uh colour fronts . {vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . {vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .",Marketing,303120,319020
12,Yeah .,User Interface,319020,319380
12,"Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .",Marketing,319380,336240
12,"Yeah , I'll get back on that .",User Interface,336240,338040
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,338040,338340
12,So {disfmarker},Marketing,338340,339240
12,{vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .,Project Manager,339240,342360
12,Intro,Marketing,342360,342660
12,Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .,Project Manager,342660,347760
12,Yeah .,Marketing,347760,348120
12,"Well ,",User Interface,348120,348480
12,"Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .",Marketing,348480,351660
12,I got f also an email from the the technology department .,User Interface,351660,355140
12,So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .,Marketing,355140,359460
12,"They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .",User Interface,359460,366480
12,Okay .,Project Manager,366480,366840
12,Well {disfmarker},User Interface,366840,367860
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,367860,368160
12,Okay .,Marketing,368160,368520
12,I'll check what they exact mean .,User Interface,368520,370500
12,Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .,Marketing,370500,373680
12,So uh {disfmarker},User Interface,373680,374760
12,"Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap",Industrial Designer,374760,380460
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,380460,380820
12,and it's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer,380820,382500
12,"th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh",User Interface,382500,388320
12,{gap},Marketing,388320,388620
12,"if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .",User Interface,388620,394380
12,"Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker}",Marketing,394380,398640
12,Since you have to uh configure speech thing .,User Interface,398640,401340
12,But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,401340,405360
12,"Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .",User Interface,405360,407760
12,"Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} .",Marketing,407760,415800
12,"Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .",Project Manager,415800,423660
12,"Yeah , so uh we gotta de",User Interface,423660,425100
12,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,425100,426180
12,We have to decide on that .,User Interface,426180,427800
12,Yeah . Okay . That was this ?,Marketing,427800,429540
12,Mm uh {disfmarker},User Interface,429540,430620
12,"Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So",Industrial Designer,430620,444900
12,L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker},User Interface,444900,447000
12,"it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .",Industrial Designer,447000,452820
12,Okay . And speech recognition ?,User Interface,452820,454680
12,"Yeah , probably too .",Industrial Designer,454680,455940
12,Advanced {gap} . Yeah .,User Interface,455940,457320
12,"I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,457320,461400
12,I'll I'll give you my design .,User Interface,461400,463200
12,"Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .",Industrial Designer,463200,469440
12,Yeah okay . So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .,User Interface,469440,493380
12,"Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .",Project Manager,493380,496140
12,"More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,496140,518640
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,518640,518940
12,"It's the most important part , I think . But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .",User Interface,518940,534420
12,"Yeah , maybe the teletext tel",Project Manager,534420,536160
12,"Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,",User Interface,536160,543540
12,No .,Project Manager,543540,543780
12,but it's {disfmarker},User Interface,543780,545040
12,"No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it .",Marketing,545040,547800
12,Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So {disfmarker},User Interface,547800,552360
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,552360,552660
12,"and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker}",User Interface,552660,563400
12,But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display .,Industrial Designer,563400,566160
12,No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .,User Interface,566160,575040
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,575040,575400
12,So the focus is on these two parts .,User Interface,575400,577560
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,577560,577920
12,So you don't see all the buttons you else need .,User Interface,577920,580800
12,{vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .,Project Manager,580800,588000
12,Uh well um {disfmarker},User Interface,588000,589380
12,So you can't use your thumb for it .,Project Manager,589380,591540
12,This is how it is now . Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume .,User Interface,591540,596460
12,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,596460,596820
12,I think it is on uh on the bottom too .,Industrial Designer,596820,599160
12,down there . But it's not not the best best .,Project Manager,599160,601860
12,Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use {disfmarker},User Interface,601860,608100
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,608100,608880
12,"Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel .",Project Manager,608880,611700
12,"Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .",Industrial Designer,611700,614520
12,"Yeah , why not .",Project Manager,614520,615480
12,For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .,User Interface,615480,618660
12,Scroll .,Industrial Designer,618660,619140
12,By just putting the volume on the side .,User Interface,619140,621540
12,And the channels as well .,Project Manager,621540,623100
12,And and just channel buttons here .,User Interface,623100,625200
12,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,625200,625740
12,But I think uh {disfmarker},User Interface,625740,627360
12,"Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .",Industrial Designer,627360,637560
12,"Well . Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here .",User Interface,637560,641340
12,"Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .",Industrial Designer,641340,647340
12,"Yeah , that's better .",Project Manager,647340,648660
12,They're on top ?,User Interface,648660,649620
12,"Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .",Project Manager,649620,654600
12,Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .,Industrial Designer,654600,659760
12,You mean uh these to the low ?,User Interface,659760,661560
12,Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button .,Project Manager,661560,664380
12,"Oh okay . Well , yeah .",User Interface,664380,665760
12,"But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom .",Industrial Designer,665760,675960
12,"Mm {disfmarker} Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker}",User Interface,675960,679620
12,Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .,Industrial Designer,679620,682860
12,"Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .",User Interface,682860,693720
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,693720,694380
12,"And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good .",User Interface,694380,699840
12,"That's that's good , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,699840,702060
12,"{vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .",User Interface,702060,710220
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,710220,710880
12,"But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .",User Interface,710880,718320
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,718320,718680
12,So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker},User Interface,718680,721140
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,721140,721440
12,"I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .",User Interface,721440,725940
12,"No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .",Industrial Designer,725940,730680
12,"Okay . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,730680,733380
12,"But uh we we can switch those two ,",Industrial Designer,733380,735480
12,"Those two , yeah .",User Interface,735480,736560
12,yeah .,Industrial Designer,736560,736920
12,"And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . {gap}",User Interface,736920,744780
12,Okay .,Marketing,744780,745140
12,"Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .",User Interface,745140,766500
12,"Yeah . Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager,766500,768120
12,To use {disfmarker},User Interface,768120,769260
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,769260,769620
12,"So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .",User Interface,769620,777420
12,Okay .,Project Manager,777420,777780
12,No .,Industrial Designer,777780,778020
12,So that's something we have to decide on .,User Interface,778020,780540
12,"Yeah , we have to keep it simple .",Industrial Designer,780540,782580
12,"We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .",Project Manager,782580,788820
12,Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay .,User Interface,788820,790920
12,"Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like .",Industrial Designer,790920,812640
12,"Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,812640,815520
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,815520,816240
12,Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved {gap} square .,User Interface,816240,820200
12,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,820200,821340
12,Square . Like .,Marketing,821340,822240
12,"Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .",Industrial Designer,822240,825060
12,Okay . So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,825060,827400
12,So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .,Industrial Designer,827400,831240
12,Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .,User Interface,831240,833640
12,"Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of",Industrial Designer,833640,842520
12,"Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control .",Project Manager,842520,848280
12,"looking , I think .",Industrial Designer,848280,849420
12,Mm .,Marketing,849420,849660
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,849660,850020
12,So the colours also .,Project Manager,850020,851280
12,"Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker}",User Interface,851280,854460
12,"So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .",Project Manager,854460,857760
12,Black yellow control . {vocalsound},User Interface,857760,859860
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,859860,860220
12,Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .,Project Manager,860220,863580
12,"Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .",Industrial Designer,863580,870240
12,"Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But {disfmarker}",User Interface,870240,876780
12,We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .,Project Manager,876780,881460
12,"No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,881460,886440
12,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,886440,887220
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,887220,887940
12,"We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .",Industrial Designer,887940,891060
12,"Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker}",User Interface,891060,898020
12,"Yeah , it's cool . Yep .",Project Manager,898020,899460
12,Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue,Industrial Designer,899460,902340
12,And still trans,Project Manager,902340,903240
12,Yes .,User Interface,903240,903540
12,Still still transparent .,Project Manager,903540,905040
12,So {disfmarker},User Interface,905040,905940
12,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,905940,906900
12,Oh yeah .,Marketing,906900,907440
12,Yeah . But with all with logo on it .,User Interface,907440,909660
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,909660,910020
12,Okay .,Project Manager,910020,910380
12,"Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the components . The case has just a {disfmarker} Here's black .",Industrial Designer,910380,919200
12,"Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .",Project Manager,919200,924300
12,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,924300,925260
12,{gap} Yeah .,User Interface,925260,925980
12,"Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?",Industrial Designer,925980,930360
12,Well one of the options .,User Interface,930360,931860
12,S,Industrial Designer,931860,931920
12,"You can {disfmarker} Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .",User Interface,931920,937200
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,937200,937560
12,"So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,",User Interface,937560,941040
12,"Yeah , we could do that .",Industrial Designer,941040,942540
12,or just uh release one .,User Interface,942540,943980
12,"Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . {vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker}",Project Manager,943980,949380
12,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Or just uh sell different ones .",User Interface,949380,952680
12,"Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .",Industrial Designer,952680,957180
12,Yeah . Cool .,Project Manager,957180,957960
12,So you can still th look through it .,Industrial Designer,957960,960180
12,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,960180,960960
12,Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .,Industrial Designer,960960,965640

12,{vocalsound} Uh uh {disfmarker},Marketing,973020,974880
12,That's better prob,Project Manager,974880,975960
12,With the hard hard buttons .,Industrial Designer,975960,977640
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,977640,978000
12,I think uh rubber really has an odd look .,User Interface,978000,980520
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,980520,980880
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,980880,981240
12,"Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .",Marketing,981240,991020
12,Yeah .,User Interface,991020,991380
12,It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't {disfmarker} Is {vocalsound} uh a button uh um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How do you say it ?,Marketing,991380,1000560
12,"Yeah , it's it's all on one level .",Industrial Designer,1000560,1002660
12,It it didn't it i it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background .,Marketing,1002660,1007160
12,"Yeah , on one level .",Industrial Designer,1007160,1008420
12,It is in uh the c a remote control uh {disfmarker},Marketing,1008420,1011420
12,Yeah .,User Interface,1011420,1011780
12,"Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1011780,1018020
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,1018020,1018380
12,Yeah .,Marketing,1018380,1018740

12,{vocalsound} I dunno what uh kind of material it is .,User Interface,1028700,1031880
12,I think . Or maybe {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1031880,1033740
12,But {disfmarker},User Interface,1033740,1034700
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1034700,1035060

12,I dunno .,Project Manager,1050480,1051020
12,The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s .,Industrial Designer,1051020,1055460
12,Y,Project Manager,1055460,1055520
12,Yeah .,User Interface,1055520,1055880
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1055880,1056780
12,Cool .,Project Manager,1056780,1057140
12,"But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .",Industrial Designer,1057140,1062420
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,1062420,1062780
12,So if you put {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1062780,1064340
12,Y i if you {disfmarker} The numbers could be can be {disfmarker},Project Manager,1064340,1068180

12,Or it runs the whole {disfmarker},User Interface,1073760,1075740
12,"Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1075740,1079400
12,They can choose .,Project Manager,1079400,1080420
12,"Yeah , you can halfs transparent ,",User Interface,1080420,1082460
12,Or no,Industrial Designer,1082460,1082760
12,or just that it's comes out a bit .,User Interface,1082760,1084860
12,"Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights",Industrial Designer,1084860,1088220
12,"Different , I think , also .",User Interface,1088220,1089900

12,"No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1108320,1112220
12,Is it {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,1112220,1113720
12,"Yeah ,",Marketing,1113720,1114080
12,I I know {disfmarker} I dunno . Is {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1114080,1117680

12,You {disfmarker},Marketing,1126200,1127160
12,Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .,Industrial Designer,1127160,1129740
12,"Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just {disfmarker} No , just some LED .",Project Manager,1129740,1135620
12,I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .,User Interface,1135620,1138860
12,I think it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1138860,1140360
12,And I can change the colour of it .,User Interface,1140360,1142460
12,"Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .",Project Manager,1142460,1147800
12,"Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it {disfmarker} I th I don't think so .",Industrial Designer,1147800,1153020
12,"Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So {disfmarker}",User Interface,1153020,1157280
12,Hmm .,Marketing,1157280,1157580
12,Then uh some more technical things .,Industrial Designer,1157580,1159740
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1159740,1160460

12,"Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager,1171800,1175580
12,W {vocalsound} So we d we just need this and {vocalsound} this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .,Industrial Designer,1175580,1183140
12,{vocalsound},User Interface,1183140,1183860
12,Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .,Industrial Designer,1183860,1188840
12,I'm sure we can fit in .,User Interface,1188840,1190280
12,So I guess we j we just need that .,Industrial Designer,1190280,1192380
12,{gap},Marketing,1192380,1192680
12,Yeah .,User Interface,1192680,1193040

12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,1195500,1196160
12,"Okay yeah ,",Marketing,1196160,1196820
12,We just {disfmarker},User Interface,1196820,1198020
12,you can you can change {disfmarker} Yeah . No .,Marketing,1198020,1200840
12,"Nah , but they just said we need it .",Industrial Designer,1200840,1203060
12,Okay .,Project Manager,1203060,1203420
12,"Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .",Industrial Designer,1203420,1207440
12,"Yeah , a recharger maybe .",Project Manager,1207440,1209000
12,"Yeah , we have to make sure to uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,1209000,1211760
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,1211760,1212420
12,"We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?",Project Manager,1212420,1215180
12,Yeah but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1215180,1216440
12,Is that still the {disfmarker},Project Manager,1216440,1218240
12,Yes . Yes .,User Interface,1218240,1218900
12,"Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Accu .",Industrial Designer,1218900,1223940
12,A recha Oh no . Uh {disfmarker} Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .,Project Manager,1223940,1228140
12,Re recharger . Base station .,User Interface,1228140,1229880
12,"Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .",Industrial Designer,1229880,1232940
12,"Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .",User Interface,1232940,1236900
12,Okay . Not a separate {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1236900,1238940
12,"No , just rechargeable batteries .",Project Manager,1238940,1240980
12,"Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one .",Industrial Designer,1240980,1243380
12,{gap},Project Manager,1243380,1243680
12,Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh {disfmarker} Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .,Industrial Designer,1243680,1254420
12,Ah cool . Okay .,Marketing,1254420,1255380
12,But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .,Project Manager,1255380,1259460
12,"So if you hold it , it gets powered .",User Interface,1259460,1261680
12,"If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and {disfmarker} Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,",Industrial Designer,1261680,1269720

12,{gap},User Interface,1271400,1271700

12,{vocalsound},Marketing,1273860,1274580
12,that's cheaper {gap} .,Project Manager,1274580,1275900
12,"Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .",Industrial Designer,1275900,1279380
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,1279380,1279740
12,"Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .",Industrial Designer,1279740,1286820
12,Okay .,Marketing,1286820,1287180
12,"So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .",Industrial Designer,1287180,1293240
12,Mm . So,User Interface,1293240,1293660
12,So we can't use the flat buttons .,Industrial Designer,1293660,1295700
12,we need uh two D_ .,User Interface,1295700,1296840
12,Yeah . Definitely .,Project Manager,1296840,1297980
12,"Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used .",Industrial Designer,1297980,1301280

12,Yeah .,Project Manager,1316760,1317120
12,But I think just the volume is enough .,Industrial Designer,1317120,1319460

12,Okay .,Project Manager,1322520,1322880
12,because you scroll too fast .,User Interface,1322880,1324620

12,Mm {disfmarker},Marketing,1330200,1331100
12,I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .,Project Manager,1331100,1337460

12,Oh just sk,Project Manager,1352460,1353060
12,We haven't decided yet .,Industrial Designer,1353060,1354500

12,"Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .",Industrial Designer,1435440,1438320
12,"Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular .",Project Manager,1438320,1441740
12,"You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second .",Industrial Designer,1441740,1447260
12,Okay .,Project Manager,1447260,1447620
12,I think I'll just check it .,Industrial Designer,1447620,1449300
12,"And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . {gap}",Project Manager,1449300,1452660
12,Yes .,User Interface,1452660,1452960
12,That's pretty much it .,Project Manager,1452960,1454340
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1454340,1454700
12,And a flashy light .,Project Manager,1454700,1455900
12,User interface concept .,User Interface,1455900,1457340
12,So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But {gap},Project Manager,1457340,1463640
12,I dunno either .,User Interface,1463640,1464600
12,Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?,Industrial Designer,1464600,1467300
12,Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .,User Interface,1467300,1471500
12,Yeah . That's for the next one .,Project Manager,1471500,1473420
12,So we should did it here ?,Industrial Designer,1473420,1474980
12,That's for th,Project Manager,1474980,1475760
12,So we're staying here ?,User Interface,1475760,1477140
12,Uh that {disfmarker} I think that's the next next meeting .,Project Manager,1477140,1480680
12,Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Okay .,Industrial Designer,1480680,1483500
12,But you definitely get a specific instruction . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1483500,1487100
12,"Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?",User Interface,1487100,1490160
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1490160,1490520
12,But th think about something that's more rounded . Just {disfmarker} And more {disfmarker} It has to be {disfmarker},Project Manager,1490520,1497480
12,"Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .",User Interface,1497480,1502520
12,Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom .,Project Manager,1502520,1505520
12,"Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .",User Interface,1505520,1509000
12,"Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a {disfmarker} What the fuck is it ? {vocalsound} Okay . Mm {disfmarker} Doesn't work . {vocalsound} You see what I mean ?",Project Manager,1509000,1521480
12,{vocalsound} What ?,Industrial Designer,1521480,1522620
12,If I draw here {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It draws about four centimetres lower than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,1522620,1529160
12,Oh . Okay .,Industrial Designer,1529160,1529820
12,"Nah okay . Just {gap} . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um {disfmarker} It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .",Project Manager,1529820,1540680
12,Like a very big scroll-wheel . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1540680,1543260
12,"Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .",Project Manager,1543260,1546800
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1546800,1547160
12,"Maybe , I dunno .",Project Manager,1547160,1548180
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1548180,1548480
12,"Okay , so we {vocalsound} have this at the moment .",Project Manager,1548480,1551540
12,I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .,Industrial Designer,1551540,1555980
12,"Yeah , you {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface,1555980,1557720
12,"Okay , so",Project Manager,1557720,1558260
12,Yeah .,User Interface,1558260,1558620
12,we'd have this . Is that okay ?,Project Manager,1558620,1560480
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,1560480,1560840
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1560840,1561200
12,"that's a little problem , of course , as well .",User Interface,1561200,1564020
12,I think it's probably better .,Industrial Designer,1564020,1565820
12,And {disfmarker},Project Manager,1565820,1566780
12,"Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger .",Industrial Designer,1566780,1575000
12,"Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh {disfmarker} That's not scrollable too easy .",User Interface,1575000,1580160
12,Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom,Project Manager,1580160,1585680
12,I think in middle .,Industrial Designer,1585680,1586820
12,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,1586820,1587720
12,Uh wh what is the middle part ?,User Interface,1587720,1589580
12,That's the numbers .,Project Manager,1589580,1590780
12,"Numbers , okay .",User Interface,1590780,1591740
12,"Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .",Industrial Designer,1591740,1597380
12,"Yeah , I agree as well .",User Interface,1597380,1598820
12,"It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .",Project Manager,1598820,1605900
12,Use the dz,User Interface,1605900,1606500
12,"Because you already have the volume here , so {disfmarker} You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . {gap} back and forth .",Project Manager,1606500,1616220
12,"Yeah , that's right .",User Interface,1616220,1617480
12,"So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well .",Project Manager,1617480,1624320
12,Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .,Industrial Designer,1624320,1630620
12,"But that's not {gap} want to zap very quick , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1630620,1634280
12,"Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority .",User Interface,1634280,1637340
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,1637340,1638120
12,"Yeah ? Is this a opportunity ,",Project Manager,1638120,1639920
12,And then you use those uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1639920,1642200
12,or you don't want a different {disfmarker},Project Manager,1642200,1644720
12,"Yeah , of course uh .",User Interface,1644720,1645980
12,"Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1645980,1650780
12,Why ?,Project Manager,1650780,1651080
12,Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1651080,1655580
12,But still the next {disfmarker} It's still the next one . Doesn't make {disfmarker},Project Manager,1655580,1660560
12,"Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you put them {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1660560,1669080
12,"Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference .",Project Manager,1669080,1674780
12,"Yeah . I I think it's {disfmarker} It's it's obvious , I think .",User Interface,1674780,1678620
12,"But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .",Industrial Designer,1678620,1686060
12,"Yeah , that's not not {disfmarker} It's not al uh always the same .",Marketing,1686060,1690080
12,But it's exactly th,Project Manager,1690080,1691220
12,In uh {disfmarker} On most on most remote controls .,Industrial Designer,1691220,1694340
12,Every remote control's uh different .,Marketing,1694340,1696560
12,"Yeah , I think {disfmarker}",User Interface,1696560,1698180
12,"So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .",Industrial Designer,1698180,1702500
12,"I dunno . I {disfmarker} You already have the volume on the side ,",Project Manager,1702500,1706460
12,"No , uh I think {disfmarker}",User Interface,1706460,1708140
12,so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake .,Project Manager,1708140,1711140
12,Yeah .,User Interface,1711140,1711500
12,So it's uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,1711500,1712880
12,I think it's s so simple,User Interface,1712880,1714320
12,I dunno .,Industrial Designer,1714320,1714860
12,you just {disfmarker},User Interface,1714860,1716120
12,"So but that's for that's for you ,",Project Manager,1716120,1718160
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1718160,1718520
12,'cause it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,1718520,1719960
12,"Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .",User Interface,1719960,1722540
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1722540,1723260
12,"Okay , so hmm . What did {disfmarker} What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno .",Project Manager,1723260,1728300
12,Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?,User Interface,1728300,1731120
12,"Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .",Marketing,1731120,1739160
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,1739160,1739520
12,'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .,Marketing,1739520,1745640
12,And the LED .,Project Manager,1745640,1746420
12,"No , you have uh {disfmarker} It is {disfmarker}",User Interface,1746420,1749300
12,"Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .",Industrial Designer,1749300,1752120
12,Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic .,User Interface,1752120,1755540
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1755540,1756440
12,You have to look at that image of the iPod .,User Interface,1756440,1759080
12,Yes . Okay .,Marketing,1759080,1759800
12,More that uh kind of style .,User Interface,1759800,1761480
12,And a bit uh {disfmarker},Marketing,1761480,1762980
12,Not not the old grey black {disfmarker},User Interface,1762980,1765320
12,Uh {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,1765320,1766640
12,Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have {disfmarker},Marketing,1766640,1770240
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1770240,1770960
12,Where you can put a ve Uh we have {disfmarker} If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .,User Interface,1770960,1778640
12,"Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,1778640,1782540
12,Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ?,Marketing,1782540,1787880
12,"Yeah , five . Let's give five .",Project Manager,1787880,1789740
12,{gap},User Interface,1789740,1790040
12,Or more or {disfmarker},Marketing,1790040,1791420
12,Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1791420,1794480
12,"And um uh {vocalsound} uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .",Marketing,1794480,1799400
12,Yeah . Um,User Interface,1799400,1799940
12,Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .,Marketing,1799940,1802880
12,"I think {disfmarker} Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh .",User Interface,1802880,1806600
12,"No , tha that will be {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1806600,1808640
12,So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?,Project Manager,1808640,1815000
12,Yes .,User Interface,1815000,1815300
12,"So you could put it like that ,",Project Manager,1815300,1817160
12,"Yeah , so top down .",Industrial Designer,1817160,1818360
12,okay .,Project Manager,1818360,1818720

12,"Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .",Marketing,1819020,1822500
12,Do we have to design that w as well ?,Industrial Designer,1822500,1824720
12,Yeah . {vocalsound},Marketing,1824720,1825860

12,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,1828140,1829280
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1829280,1829580

12,"Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example .",User Interface,1838040,1842480

12,Mm . Mm .,User Interface,1847580,1848120
12,"Yeah ,",Marketing,1848120,1848480

12,but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then .,Marketing,1848900,1851960
12,Here you see one that's very round .,User Interface,1851960,1854120
12,"Oh yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,1854120,1855080
12,So I think that can be all kind of shapes .,User Interface,1855080,1857660
12,But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all .,Project Manager,1857660,1861500
12,Of the remote control ?,Industrial Designer,1861500,1862880
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,1862880,1863240

12,and {disfmarker},User Interface,2023920,2024880
12,It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh {disfmarker},Marketing,2024880,2028300

12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,2032140,2033040
12,I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .,Project Manager,2033040,2036160
12,Mm .,User Interface,2036160,2036400
12,"Okay . Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,2036400,2037180
12,It {disfmarker} The th th,Marketing,2037180,2038680
12,I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .,Industrial Designer,2038680,2043480
12,No .,Project Manager,2043480,2043720
12,Yeah .,Marketing,2043720,2044080
12,"But I I think it's still for older people . You j still have older people . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal {disfmarker}",Project Manager,2044080,2055660
12,"Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .",Industrial Designer,2055660,2058600
12,"There is one {disfmarker} There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different {disfmarker}",Marketing,2058600,2072640
12,"Yeah , {gap} idea . But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker}",User Interface,2072640,2079600
12,But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy .,Project Manager,2079600,2085960
12,And if you make it look like the iPod {disfmarker},User Interface,2085960,2088960
12,"Yeah , they're all the same .",Marketing,2088960,2090700
12,Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change,User Interface,2090700,2093520
12,Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the {vocalsound} wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .,Project Manager,2093520,2103300
12,compared to {disfmarker},User Interface,2103300,2104740
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,2104740,2105040
12,Ye yeah . Well uh {disfmarker},User Interface,2105040,2106840
12,"Yeah , we could do that .",Industrial Designer,2106840,2108340
12,Could .,User Interface,2108340,2108760
12,"Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow .",Marketing,2108760,2113740
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,2113740,2114100
12,"No , I think {disfmarker} Oh .",User Interface,2114100,2115900
12,It's right .,Project Manager,2115900,2116620
12,"Think the scroll wheel {vocalsound} won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .",User Interface,2116620,2124780
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,2124780,2125140
12,So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much .,User Interface,2125140,2129880
12,Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has {vocalsound} if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . So maybe you have to ask her .,Project Manager,2129880,2142960
12,"Yeah okay . Well ,",User Interface,2142960,2144040
12,No .,Marketing,2144040,2144280

13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,414060,414780
13,{vocalsound} I was very good in drawing . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,414780,418020
13,You should feed that uh that animal . {vocalsound},User Interface,418020,421020
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,421020,421740
13,"{vocalsound} Well , I guess you uh get the idea . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,421740,425460
13,"Yes , okay . {vocalsound} Beautiful .",Project Manager,425460,427680
13,Beautiful .,Industrial Designer,427680,428340
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,428340,429060
13,"Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions {disfmarker} well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um {vocalsound} the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . {vocalsound} Um",Project Manager,429060,453600
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,453600,454320
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,454320,455040
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,455040,455760
13,"we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , {vocalsound} um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .",Project Manager,455760,481500
13,"Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh",Industrial Designer,481500,490320
13,Limitations .,Project Manager,490320,491100
13,influations influences .,Industrial Designer,491100,492540
13,Okay .,Project Manager,492540,492900
13,Okay .,User Interface,492900,493260
13,"Okay , great .",Project Manager,493260,494100
13,"Okay ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . {vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .",Industrial Designer,494100,534360
13,Okay .,User Interface,534360,534720
13,"I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .",Industrial Designer,534720,559200
13,And for a cell phone ?,User Interface,559200,560520
13,"Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .",Industrial Designer,560520,564840
13,"Yeah , okay . Yeah .",User Interface,564840,566040
13,"I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh",Industrial Designer,566040,579900
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,579900,580620
13,is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .,Industrial Designer,580620,587220
13,"But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .",User Interface,587220,594480
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,594480,594960
13,"But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so",User Interface,594960,598080
13,"But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .",Industrial Designer,598080,602100
13,y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .,User Interface,602100,604560
13,So that's the point .,Industrial Designer,604560,605820
13,Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker},User Interface,605820,607800
13,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,607800,608700
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,608700,609420
13,you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .,User Interface,609420,613260
13,"Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss",Industrial Designer,613260,616200
13,Yeah .,User Interface,616200,616560
13,"and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,",Industrial Designer,616560,631680
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,631680,632040
13,but take these things into account when you start the discussion .,Industrial Designer,632040,636000
13,"Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,",Project Manager,636000,642420
13,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer,642420,642720
13,and {disfmarker},Project Manager,642720,643680
13,"so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,",Industrial Designer,643680,649020
13,"Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,649020,650820
13,and the way of communicating with these equipments .,Industrial Designer,650820,653940
13,"Okay . Okay , good .",Project Manager,653940,655140
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,655140,655500
13,"Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .",Project Manager,655500,658980
13,That's it .,Industrial Designer,658980,659640
13,Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .,Project Manager,659640,670200
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,670200,670920
13,"Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .",Project Manager,670920,690720
13,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,690720,691200
13,H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?,Project Manager,691200,694980
13,"Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?",User Interface,694980,707940
13,Yep .,Project Manager,707940,708240
13,{vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .,User Interface,708240,714720
13,"Yes , I think it should be something like that .",Industrial Designer,714720,717600
13,"It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,",User Interface,717600,723060
13,"Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,",Project Manager,723060,726060
13,right ?,User Interface,726060,726480
13,not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker},Project Manager,726480,730380
13,"Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .",User Interface,730380,736260
13,"We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?",Industrial Designer,736260,740220
13,No . No .,Project Manager,740220,740760
13,"No ,",Industrial Designer,740760,741000
13,"No , okay .",User Interface,741000,741660
13,"we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .",Industrial Designer,741660,748980
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,748980,749340
13,Yeah .,User Interface,749340,749700
13,"Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?",Project Manager,749700,751260
13,"Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .",Marketing,751260,753960
13,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager,753960,754740
13,"{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .",User Interface,754740,768060
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,768060,768420
13,So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker},User Interface,768420,773220
13,So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker},Project Manager,773220,776940
13,Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,776940,778860
13,"Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .",User Interface,778860,788160
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,788160,788640
13,It just should change the T_V_'s state .,User Interface,788640,791040
13,Okay .,Project Manager,791040,791400
13,So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker},User Interface,791400,794160
13,And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?,Industrial Designer,794160,797880
13,"Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .",User Interface,797880,799560
13,Or are there any o other controls ?,Industrial Designer,799560,801660
13,"Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}",User Interface,801660,804960
13,"Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,804960,808680
13,But {disfmarker},User Interface,808680,809640
13,"I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .",Industrial Designer,809640,815820
13,Yeah .,User Interface,815820,816180
13,Uh-huh .,Project Manager,816180,816660
13,You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,816660,821580
13,They're very vu vulnerable .,User Interface,821580,823260
13,"w yes ,",Industrial Designer,823260,823680
13,Yeah .,User Interface,823680,824040
13,"to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,",Industrial Designer,824040,833760
13,Yeah .,User Interface,833760,834120
13,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,834120,834960
13,"And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,",User Interface,834960,846000
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,846000,846480
13,"so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}",User Interface,846480,851100
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,851100,851460
13,Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .,Project Manager,851460,853320
13,"Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .",User Interface,853320,859440
13,Okay,Project Manager,859440,859680
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,859680,860160
13,{disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,860160,861840
13,"Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .",Industrial Designer,861840,871920
13,"Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,",User Interface,871920,882960
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,882960,883440
13,"but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,883440,893760
13,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,893760,894780
13,"Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting",Project Manager,894780,900180
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,900180,900540
13,But {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface,900540,901920
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,901920,902280
13,um {disfmarker},Project Manager,902280,903180
13,Two more things .,User Interface,903180,904200
13,okay .,Project Manager,904200,904560
13,"Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .",User Interface,904560,918360
13,"Okay , s yeah .",Project Manager,918360,919260
13,"You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .",User Interface,919260,922860
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,922860,923220
13,"And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too .",User Interface,923220,930180
13,Okay .,Project Manager,930180,930540
13,So when it's dark {disfmarker},User Interface,930540,932340
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,932340,933060
13,Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker},User Interface,933060,936120
13,Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha {vocalsound},Project Manager,936120,939540
13,Yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect . {vocalsound},User Interface,939540,942840
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,942840,943560
13,Okay .,Project Manager,943560,943920
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,943920,944280
13,"Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .",Project Manager,944280,948480
13,Do do you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,948480,949800
13,Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?,Project Manager,949800,961080
13,"Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .",Marketing,961080,966300
13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,966300,966780
13,"And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .",Marketing,966780,969420
13,Because ?,Project Manager,969420,969960
13,"Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .",Marketing,969960,973500
13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,973500,973980
13,But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that .,Marketing,973980,980040
13,"Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?",Project Manager,980040,983820
13,"Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,",Industrial Designer,983820,986820
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,986820,987540
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,987540,988260
13,"but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them . Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .",Industrial Designer,988260,997800
13,Yeah .,User Interface,997800,998160
13,"Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it .",Industrial Designer,998160,1007040
13,"Yeah . Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple ,",User Interface,1007040,1011180
13,I I don't know .,Industrial Designer,1011180,1012140
13,you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .,User Interface,1012140,1015560
13,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer,1015560,1016460
13,The uh the the digits in black .,User Interface,1016460,1018380
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1018380,1018860
13,Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy,User Interface,1018860,1024260
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1024260,1024620
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1024620,1025340
13,"{disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course .",User Interface,1025340,1028580
13,Okay .,Project Manager,1028580,1028940
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1028940,1029300
13,"Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1029300,1035060
13,"Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .",Industrial Designer,1035060,1037520
13,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,1037520,1037880
13,"Well , that's more {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1037880,1039740
13,"twelve Euro fifty , yeah .",Project Manager,1039740,1041300
13,Yeah .,Marketing,1041300,1041660
13,"So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .",Industrial Designer,1041660,1050540
13,Okay .,Project Manager,1050540,1050900
13,The cost price is very low .,Industrial Designer,1050900,1052580
13,Just remind something .,User Interface,1052580,1053960
13,Um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1053960,1054860
13,The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .,User Interface,1054860,1058820
13,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager,1058820,1059600
13,You have a m uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1059600,1061280
13,Okay . Very good point . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1061280,1063140
13,"Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .",User Interface,1063140,1068300
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1068300,1068660
13,"Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily",Project Manager,1068660,1076880
13,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer,1076880,1077780
13,um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .,Project Manager,1077780,1086360
13,Yeah .,User Interface,1086360,1086720
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1086720,1087080
13,{vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker},Project Manager,1087080,1094940
13,"But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah .",User Interface,1094940,1097220
13,"yeah . I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1097220,1102800
13,Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .,User Interface,1102800,1105620
13,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1105620,1105920
13,'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1105920,1108320
13,{vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1108320,1111260
13,Well does it ?,Project Manager,1111260,1112100
13,"Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .",User Interface,1112100,1114380
13,well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1114380,1115400
13,I'm not sure . Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,1115400,1117200
13,"Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay .",Industrial Designer,1117200,1124160
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,1124160,1124520
13,So uh technically it will be possible .,Industrial Designer,1124520,1126860
13,"But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .",User Interface,1126860,1131540
13,"Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .",Project Manager,1131540,1135140
13,Does it {disfmarker},User Interface,1135140,1136340
13,"No , you cannot .",Industrial Designer,1136340,1137360
13,{vocalsound} It's over ?,User Interface,1137360,1138800
13,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,1138800,1139940

13,Um,Project Manager,1140660,1140780
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1140780,1141140
13,"{vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it .",Project Manager,1141140,1154940
13,Okay .,User Interface,1154940,1155300
13,See you in thirty minutes .,Project Manager,1155300,1156920

14,There he is .,Project Manager,9360,10140
14,{vocalsound} Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer,10140,13260
14,We have a slight problem . {vocalsound} I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .,User Interface,13260,17940
14,Sorry ?,Project Manager,17940,18360
14,{vocalsound} Can I get a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer,18360,20760
14,"Uh no . You can't ,",Project Manager,20760,21900
14,Okay . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,21900,23040
14,sorry .,Project Manager,23040,23460
14,So just cancel it .,User Interface,23460,24600
14,"{gap} Well , during my work I have no time either .",Industrial Designer,24600,27660
14,"{vocalsound} Well ,",Project Manager,27660,28800
14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,28800,30480
14,"this is life . {vocalsound} Sorry uh , Roo .",Project Manager,30480,33120
14,"Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . {vocalsound} Accidentally .",User Interface,33120,36840
14,"Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .",Project Manager,36840,40500
14,But it's alright .,User Interface,40500,41580
14,"{vocalsound} Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it .",Project Manager,41580,56520
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,56520,57000
14,"Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?",Project Manager,57000,61680
14,I think so too .,Industrial Designer,61680,62640
14,Roo ?,Project Manager,62640,62940
14,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface,62940,64080
14,Ruud ?,Project Manager,64080,64440
14,Almost . {vocalsound},Marketing,64440,65700
14,"Almost , okay .",Project Manager,65700,66600
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,66600,67320
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,67320,68040
14,Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m,Project Manager,68040,72480
14,"But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .",User Interface,72480,76200
14,{vocalsound} Um we will figure that out . Ca {vocalsound} can you try to {disfmarker},Project Manager,76200,81300
14,Okay .,User Interface,81300,81660
14,Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the {gap} .,Marketing,81660,85800
14,"Yeah , w we will see .",Project Manager,85800,87120
14,I don't think it's wireless here .,User Interface,87120,89160
14,"Um {disfmarker} it is , yeah . Yeah .",Project Manager,89160,91380
14,It is .,Industrial Designer,91380,91800
14,Or it is . Yeah ?,User Interface,91800,92820
14,It is .,Industrial Designer,92820,93240
14,"Okay , great .",User Interface,93240,94080
14,Uh okay .,Marketing,94080,94620
14,"Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um {vocalsound} we have forty minutes . So it's now {disfmarker} Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . {vocalsound} It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w",Project Manager,94620,136320
14,Yeah .,User Interface,136320,136680
14,uh uh {disfmarker} we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .,Project Manager,136680,142680
14,"Time , yeah .",User Interface,142680,143460
14,"Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , {vocalsound} which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um {vocalsound} then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .",Project Manager,143460,171420
14,Yes .,User Interface,171420,171720
14,"Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?",Project Manager,171720,182040
14,"Yeah , I'll start .",User Interface,182040,183180
14,"Uh uh yeah . Okay ,",Project Manager,183180,184320
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,184320,184620
14,great .,Project Manager,184620,185040
14,"Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .",User Interface,185040,191460
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,191460,192180
14,Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .,User Interface,192180,212340
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,212340,212700
14,"Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .",User Interface,212700,224940
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,224940,225420
14,And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .,User Interface,225420,232380
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,232380,232740
14,"{vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .",User Interface,232740,251340
14,Uh-huh .,Project Manager,251340,251820
14,"So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .",User Interface,251820,272220
14,"Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?",Project Manager,272220,274320
14,Yeah .,User Interface,274320,274680
14,"Yeah , uh b uh most .",Marketing,274680,275940
14,"Okay , so",Project Manager,275940,276480
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,276480,277200
14,the important thing here is {disfmarker},Project Manager,277200,279600
14,{vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .,User Interface,279600,284460
14,"Oh , user-friendly .",Marketing,284460,285660
14,"In the market , yeah .",Project Manager,285660,286980
14,"Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .",User Interface,286980,290340
14,"Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,290340,293220
14,Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .,User Interface,293220,299760
14,Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .,Project Manager,299760,301260
14,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,301260,304680
14,{vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound},User Interface,304680,306660
14,"Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .",Industrial Designer,306660,316680
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,316680,317400
14,"Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,",Industrial Designer,317400,330420
14,Energies and uh {disfmarker},User Interface,330420,332100
14,but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?,Industrial Designer,332100,334680
14,"No , it's not visible .",Project Manager,334680,336060
14,"No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .",Industrial Designer,336060,381480
14,Yeah .,User Interface,381480,381840
14,"There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w",Industrial Designer,381840,391740
14,The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .,User Interface,391740,394680
14,yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,394680,403080
14,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager,403080,403860
14,"Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .",Industrial Designer,403860,425940
14,So it's fairly easy .,Project Manager,425940,427200
14,"There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,",Industrial Designer,427200,432120
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,432120,433260
14,{vocalsound} Succeed in it also .,User Interface,433260,435240
14,and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .,Industrial Designer,435240,439680
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,439680,440400
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,440400,440760
14,"So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh",Industrial Designer,440760,443220
14,good .,Project Manager,443220,443580
14,"personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear .",Industrial Designer,443580,453900
14,Okay .,Project Manager,453900,454260
14,"Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .",Industrial Designer,454260,485460
14,Okay .,Project Manager,485460,485820
14,"And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .",Industrial Designer,485820,494580
14,{vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker},User Interface,494580,497160
14,I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .,Industrial Designer,497160,500700
14,"if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}",User Interface,500700,504720
14,"No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .",Industrial Designer,504720,507480
14,Okay .,User Interface,507480,507840
14,So we can use them . So that's no problem .,Industrial Designer,507840,510420
14,"For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker}",User Interface,510420,513720
14,"Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,513720,519240
14,Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker},User Interface,519240,523080
14,We can we can make its I think .,Industrial Designer,523080,525000
14,"Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .",Marketing,525000,531780
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,531780,532140
14,Yeah .,User Interface,532140,532500
14,"Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .",Project Manager,532500,543420
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing,543420,544320
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,544320,544680
14,But I think {disfmarker},User Interface,544680,546120
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,546120,546420
14,"Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,",User Interface,546420,553440
14,"Hmm , true . {vocalsound}",Marketing,553440,554940
14,and not for {disfmarker},User Interface,554940,556380
14,"Yes . Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .",Industrial Designer,556380,562500
14,"Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .",User Interface,562500,565500
14,"No no no , no . That's right , that's right .",Industrial Designer,565500,568200
14,Okay .,Project Manager,568200,568560
14,"So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it .",Industrial Designer,568560,571260
14,Okay .,Project Manager,571260,571620
14,{vocalsound} Um have a think about it .,Industrial Designer,571620,573960
14,"Yeah . Okay , Ruud .",Project Manager,573960,575160
14,"Oh , mine is already outdated .",Marketing,575160,577020
14,"Okay well ,",Project Manager,577020,577680
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,577680,578400
14,we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .,Project Manager,578400,583560
14,{vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker},Marketing,583560,585600
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,585600,586320
14,So any income is welcome . {vocalsound} Input .,Project Manager,586320,589140
14,"Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .",Marketing,589140,601080
14,Okay .,Project Manager,601080,601440
14,"Could you step a little bit more to the right ? {vocalsound} Yeah , thank you . {vocalsound}",User Interface,601440,606960
14,"But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .",Marketing,606960,619800
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,619800,620520
14,"Uh well , skip this . {vocalsound}",Marketing,620520,622560
14,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager,622560,623700
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,623700,624420
14,"Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .",Marketing,624420,648420
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer,648420,648660
14,So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .,Marketing,648660,654900
14,"Okay . Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager,654900,656940
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing,656940,657840
14,"Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function ,",Industrial Designer,657840,660420
14,Yeah .,User Interface,660420,660780
14,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,660780,661140
14,you know .,Industrial Designer,661140,661740
14,that's definitely interesting .,Project Manager,661740,663600
14,That's quite a {disfmarker} yes .,Industrial Designer,663600,665580
14,It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .,Project Manager,665580,668880
14,Sound signal .,User Interface,668880,669720
14,Yeah .,Marketing,669720,670080
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,670080,670440
14,Yeah .,User Interface,670440,670800
14,go on .,Project Manager,670800,671220
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,671220,671520
14,"Well , I just said that . And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it .",Marketing,671520,676860
14,Okay . So that's what the market tells us .,Project Manager,676860,679440
14,"Uh that's about it , yes .",Marketing,679440,681000
14,Yep . Okay .,Project Manager,681000,681720
14,The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .,User Interface,681720,685020
14,Uh mo uh zap buttons most .,Marketing,685020,686640
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface,686640,687540
14,"Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So {disfmarker}",Marketing,687540,693060
14,"Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons . And first um {disfmarker}",User Interface,693060,701580
14,"Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .",Industrial Designer,701580,704400
14,Yeah .,User Interface,704400,704760
14,Yep .,Project Manager,704760,705060
14,"Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .",Industrial Designer,705060,729240
14,"Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?",User Interface,729240,737400
14,Well,Industrial Designer,737400,737640
14,"Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem . Yeah . {vocalsound}",Marketing,737640,742080
14,Yes . {vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem .,Industrial Designer,742080,746220
14,{vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .,User Interface,746220,749040
14,Well,Project Manager,749040,749280
14,Usually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,749280,750480
14,"maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",Project Manager,750480,752940
14,It should be uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface,752940,754800
14,like um turning on and off the the the lights .,Project Manager,754800,757620
14,Oh yes .,Industrial Designer,757620,758100
14,"Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .",User Interface,758100,761760
14,"Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .",Industrial Designer,761760,780000
14,Reports rep respend response to it .,Project Manager,780000,782160
14,And um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,782160,783300
14,"just like uh the phones Yeah ,",User Interface,783300,785100
14,"Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .",Industrial Designer,785100,787620
14,the {disfmarker},User Interface,787620,788580
14,Yeah .,Marketing,788580,788940
14,But uh th,Project Manager,788940,789480
14,But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,789480,793080
14,"No , so we we should use something else .",Industrial Designer,793080,795540
14,And you {disfmarker},Marketing,795540,796740
14,"Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,796740,800340
14,But I believe you will have an {disfmarker},User Interface,800340,802920
14,"Yeah , and usually {disfmarker}",Marketing,802920,804780
14,We do not control the T_V_ set so well .,Industrial Designer,804780,807180
14,"And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,",Marketing,807180,812700
14,"Yes , m yes . S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers ,",Industrial Designer,812700,819480
14,and it's {disfmarker},Marketing,819480,820740
14,Okay .,Project Manager,820740,821100
14,so we should think about {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,821100,823320
14,So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se,Project Manager,823320,826680
14,I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .,User Interface,826680,830520
14,"{vocalsound} It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .",Industrial Designer,830520,838740
14,{vocalsound} And b,Marketing,838740,839820
14,"Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,839820,843840
14,"Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,",Industrial Designer,843840,852720
14,"Yeah , a peak . Yeah .",Project Manager,852720,854040
14,which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .,Industrial Designer,854040,858240
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,858240,858600
14,But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .,Industrial Designer,858600,865080
14,"So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .",Marketing,865080,868860
14,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager,868860,870060
14,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer,870060,870360
14,But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .,User Interface,870360,877380
14,so we don't want that .,Industrial Designer,877380,878760
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,878760,879480
14,Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that .,Industrial Designer,879480,882300
14,Well if you lost th,User Interface,882300,883440
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer,883440,883800
14,Well uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,883800,885000
14,is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,885000,888540
14,I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .,User Interface,888540,896040
14,"Well , I don't think uh {gap} .",Industrial Designer,896040,897900
14,Uh that's just uh {disfmarker},User Interface,897900,899700
14,"No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,",Industrial Designer,899700,911820
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,911820,912180
14,"so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .",Industrial Designer,912180,925440
14,{gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .,User Interface,925440,929520
14,"Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .",Industrial Designer,929520,933600
14,"Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .",Project Manager,933600,943380
14,So that's not a good idea .,Industrial Designer,943380,945000
14,Yeah .,Marketing,945000,945360
14,"Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,",Project Manager,945360,950820
14,Mm-hmm . I will .,Industrial Designer,950820,951840
14,Yeah .,User Interface,951840,952200
14,because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .,Project Manager,952200,955560
14,Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated,Industrial Designer,955560,964920
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,964920,965400
14,um and it will become more costly also .,Industrial Designer,965400,967800
14,Yep .,Project Manager,967800,968100
14,Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp,Industrial Designer,968100,974340
14,"And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?",User Interface,974340,979320
14,"Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .",Industrial Designer,979320,985740
14,It's a unique item uh {disfmarker},User Interface,985740,987780
14,"Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .",Project Manager,987780,990240
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,990240,991140
14,It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .,User Interface,991140,995160
14,"It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,",Project Manager,995160,999420
14,Yeah .,Marketing,999420,999780
14,Yeah .,User Interface,999780,1000140
14,and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .,Project Manager,1000140,1007160
14,"And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .",User Interface,1007160,1014660
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,1014660,1015020
14,What should we choose in in design ?,User Interface,1015020,1017180
14,"Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .",Project Manager,1017180,1023240
14,"Well , the extra functions .",User Interface,1023240,1024920
14,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,1024920,1025820
14,I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .,Marketing,1025820,1028940
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1028940,1029300
14,"Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .",Marketing,1029300,1036080
14,Used option .,User Interface,1036080,1036860
14,Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1036860,1038000
14,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1038000,1039920
14,"Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound}",Project Manager,1039920,1044600
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,1044600,1045320
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,1045320,1046040
14,"Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .",Marketing,1046040,1050780
14,"Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .",Project Manager,1050780,1057140
14,So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .,Marketing,1057140,1058880
14,"Well , we skip that .",Project Manager,1058880,1060140
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,1060140,1061040
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1061040,1061400
14,"Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .",User Interface,1061400,1068360
14,"No , no .",Industrial Designer,1068360,1068900
14,No .,Project Manager,1068900,1069140
14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,1069140,1070820
14,Nope .,Marketing,1070820,1071180
14,So that's out of the question .,Industrial Designer,1071180,1073040
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,1073040,1073400
14,Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .,User Interface,1073400,1080660
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1080660,1081560
14,Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .,Project Manager,1081560,1084560
14,"I think also . Yes . Well ,",Industrial Designer,1084560,1086180
14,No .,Project Manager,1086180,1086420
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface,1086420,1087320
14,we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface,Industrial Designer,1087320,1098660
14,"Yeah . Okay ,",Project Manager,1098660,1099440
14,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1099440,1100400
14,"Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1100400,1107900
14,"Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might ,",Marketing,1107900,1114140
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,1114140,1114620
14,'cause young people uh like new features .,Marketing,1114620,1117140
14,Mm yeah .,Project Manager,1117140,1117680
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,1117680,1118580
14,"Yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer,1118580,1119840
14,"Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1119840,1122480
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer,1122480,1122720
14,"Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .",User Interface,1122720,1127580
14,"Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .",Industrial Designer,1127580,1138860
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,1138860,1139220
14,"Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1139220,1148640
14,"But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh",Project Manager,1148640,1160520
14,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .",Industrial Designer,1160520,1174260
14,But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?,Project Manager,1174260,1180260
14,"Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound}",User Interface,1180260,1182540
14,Because we do not implement uh a user history .,Project Manager,1182540,1185360
14,"Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .",Industrial Designer,1185360,1192560
14,"I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1192560,1197000
14,"W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .",Industrial Designer,1197000,1212720
14,"And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .",Marketing,1212720,1220760
14,Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .,Project Manager,1220760,1225620
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,1225620,1225920
14,"But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,",User Interface,1225920,1233660
14,"Yeah , draw draw it on the board .",Project Manager,1233660,1235700
14,"should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh .",User Interface,1235700,1241280
14,"yeah , something like that . Oh",Industrial Designer,1241280,1243140
14,It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .,User Interface,1243140,1250640
14,"It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes .",Industrial Designer,1250640,1253880
14,A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down,User Interface,1253880,1257180
14,"Yeah , it can break down .",Project Manager,1257180,1258740
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,1258740,1259040
14,or uh,User Interface,1259040,1259340
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,1259340,1260000
14,"just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .",User Interface,1260000,1263240
14,Yeah .,Marketing,1263240,1263600
14,"And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .",Industrial Designer,1263600,1267500
14,Yeah .,User Interface,1267500,1267860
14,"I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .",Industrial Designer,1267860,1271400
14,A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh .,Marketing,1271400,1273260
14,But you're the marketing man .,Industrial Designer,1273260,1275060
14,"And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .",Marketing,1275060,1285680
14,"Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound}",User Interface,1285680,1289400
14,Uh-huh . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1289400,1290660
14,The programme up and down . {vocalsound},User Interface,1290660,1293060
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1293060,1293780
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,1293780,1294500
14,"Okay , yeah .",Project Manager,1294500,1295280
14,"And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .",User Interface,1295280,1299060
14,"Okay , that's good .",Industrial Designer,1299060,1300260
14,"Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .",Project Manager,1300260,1323180
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1323180,1323660
14,"But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think .",User Interface,1323660,1338600
14,"Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah .",Project Manager,1338600,1343220
14,Yes ?,User Interface,1343220,1343520
14,We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience .,Project Manager,1343520,1351080
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1351080,1351560
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,1351560,1352700
14,"but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay ,",User Interface,1352700,1355520
14,Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?,Industrial Designer,1355520,1363800
14,"Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .",Project Manager,1363800,1376100
14,Okay . Okay .,Industrial Designer,1376100,1376880
14,The ten digits .,User Interface,1376880,1377840
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1377840,1378320
14,"Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1378320,1387440
14,"Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change",User Interface,1387440,1400880
14,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer,1400880,1401720

14,Uh and I think the most {disfmarker},User Interface,1490400,1492560
14,I can imagine when,Industrial Designer,1492560,1493640
14,I agree actually . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1493640,1495500
14,"Just elder elder people would would buy it ,",User Interface,1495500,1498140
14,"I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .",Industrial Designer,1498140,1507560
14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing,1507560,1508580
14,but {disfmarker},User Interface,1508580,1509540
14,"But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .",Industrial Designer,1509540,1521840
14,But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .,Project Manager,1521840,1524840
14,But {disfmarker},Marketing,1524840,1525800
14,Yep . The older people only use five of them .,User Interface,1525800,1528560
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer,1528560,1528920
14,"Yeah ,",Marketing,1528920,1529280
14,but how how often do you watch all these channels ?,Industrial Designer,1529280,1532340
14,"and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .",Marketing,1532340,1540620
14,Often .,Project Manager,1540620,1541040
14,"No , you're probably right .",Industrial Designer,1541040,1542720
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,1542720,1543620
14,Yeah .,User Interface,1543620,1543980
14,Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?,Industrial Designer,1543980,1548660
14,"Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1548660,1553040
14,The design .,Industrial Designer,1553040,1553760
14,On the design .,User Interface,1553760,1554660
14,"Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it .",Industrial Designer,1554660,1561320
14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing,1561320,1562340
14,You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy,Project Manager,1562340,1565280
14,And {disfmarker},Marketing,1565280,1566240
14,"by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .",Project Manager,1566240,1573140
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1573140,1573620
14,So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker},Project Manager,1573620,1576680
14,Yeah .,User Interface,1576680,1577040
14,"Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .",Industrial Designer,1577040,1583880
14,"Exactly , exactly .",Project Manager,1583880,1585020
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1585020,1585380
14,"And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker}",Marketing,1585380,1597380
14,"Okay , speech .",Project Manager,1597380,1598280
14,"Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .",Industrial Designer,1598280,1602240
14,Yeah .,User Interface,1602240,1602600
14,"So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .",Industrial Designer,1602600,1610340
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,1610340,1610700
14,And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .,Industrial Designer,1610700,1613760
14,To find {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,1613760,1615380
14,"So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .",Industrial Designer,1615380,1619700
14,Yeah .,Marketing,1619700,1620060
14,Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits,Project Manager,1620060,1623240
14,But maybe when we uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1623240,1625220
14,"but keep the programme and the volume ,",Project Manager,1625220,1627560
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1627560,1628040
14,"because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1628040,1632600
14,"Okay . Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer,1632600,1633800
14,Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but,Marketing,1633800,1639560
14,Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .,Project Manager,1639560,1644180
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,1644180,1644540
14,Yes .,Marketing,1644540,1644840
14,"Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .",Industrial Designer,1644840,1649220
14,So,User Interface,1649220,1649340
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1649340,1649700
14,we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .,User Interface,1649700,1654740
14,"Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function .",Industrial Designer,1654740,1667460
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1667460,1667940
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1667940,1668300
14,"So that's that's a big advantage , I think .",Industrial Designer,1668300,1670940
14,"Okay , g good .",Project Manager,1670940,1671840
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,1671840,1672560
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1672560,1672920
14,There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .,Industrial Designer,1672920,1684500
14,Mm .,Project Manager,1684500,1684740
14,But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it .,Industrial Designer,1684740,1688880
14,Yep .,Project Manager,1688880,1689180
14,There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .,Industrial Designer,1689180,1695180
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1695180,1695540
14,"So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .",Industrial Designer,1695540,1700100
14,But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?,Project Manager,1700100,1703880
14,You have to do nothing for it .,Industrial Designer,1703880,1705740
14,M {vocalsound},Marketing,1705740,1706580
14,{vocalsound} Twelve dollar fifty . {vocalsound},User Interface,1706580,1709400
14,Because it seems like a very {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,1709400,1712640
14,"{vocalsound} Maybe , maybe not .",Industrial Designer,1712640,1714560
14,"And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .",Marketing,1714560,1721940
14,"I'll have to find that out . Yes . So {disfmarker} No , that's very cheap .",Industrial Designer,1721940,1726440
14,'Cause when {disfmarker},Marketing,1726440,1727880
14,Is a cradle very cheap ?,Project Manager,1727880,1729320
14,"It's {disfmarker} Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .",Industrial Designer,1729320,1735800
14,"I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .",Project Manager,1735800,1739040
14,"It's {disfmarker} Yes , but they're they're mass production .",Industrial Designer,1739040,1742700
14,Yeah .,Marketing,1742700,1743060
14,They're very cheap .,Industrial Designer,1743060,1744260
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1744260,1744620
14,So it will cost us p practically nothing .,Industrial Designer,1744620,1747140
14,"Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um {vocalsound} I would like to hear um {disfmarker} maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?",Project Manager,1747140,1766700
14,Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .,Marketing,1766700,1779720
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1779720,1780440
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1780440,1780800
14,"But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So {disfmarker} I don't think that's a big problem",Marketing,1780800,1789020
14,"Okay . Okay , so",Project Manager,1789020,1789980
14,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1789980,1790340
14,"although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh {disfmarker} Profitable . We we {disfmarker} yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",Project Manager,1790340,1801500
14,"Yes . Yeah , profitable .",Marketing,1801500,1803000
14,Profitable .,Industrial Designer,1803000,1803720
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1803720,1804080
14,Yes .,Marketing,1804080,1804380
14,O okay . {vocalsound} Um Roo . {gap} {disfmarker} Nothing to add .,Project Manager,1804380,1808340
14,"I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .",User Interface,1808340,1810980
14,Sebastian ?,Project Manager,1810980,1811640
14,Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um,Industrial Designer,1811640,1817640
14,Yeah ? Great .,Project Manager,1817640,1818480
14,"so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that {disfmarker} these kinds of things .",Industrial Designer,1818480,1844280
14,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,Project Manager,1844280,1845180
14,"Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .",Industrial Designer,1845180,1867500
14,Yep .,Project Manager,1867500,1867800
14,"Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not {disfmarker} do not implement these buttons . {vocalsound} If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1867800,1885320
14,"Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1885320,1889580
14,"well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .",Industrial Designer,1889580,1897560
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,1897560,1897920
14,And this even uh makes it more cheapy .,Industrial Designer,1897920,1900260
14,But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?,User Interface,1900260,1903740
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,1903740,1904220
14,The board .,Project Manager,1904220,1904880
14,The circuit board .,User Interface,1904880,1906020
14,The circuit board .,Industrial Designer,1906020,1907160
14,The fewer buttons you can use on it .,User Interface,1907160,1909380
14,"No , it's th",Project Manager,1909380,1910100
14,"The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .",Industrial Designer,1910100,1914660
14,yeah .,Project Manager,1914660,1915020
14,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,1915020,1915800

14,Yeah .,User Interface,1917840,1918200
14,"And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage .",Industrial Designer,1918200,1924980
14,It shouldn't be a big issue .,Project Manager,1924980,1926720
14,Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition .,User Interface,1926720,1934340
14,"So {disfmarker} Yes , because I don't know {disfmarker} Yes . I d I really don't know . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1934340,1940520
14,No .,User Interface,1940520,1940760
14,Okay .,Project Manager,1940760,1941120
14,It can be costly . Maybe not .,Industrial Designer,1941120,1942920
14,"I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that .",Project Manager,1942920,1950480
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,1950480,1950780
14,Um I'm not sure how how that {disfmarker},Project Manager,1950780,1953240

14,Mm yes .,Industrial Designer,2037240,2037720
14,Yeah .,User Interface,2037720,2038080
14,I think that's what we decided .,Project Manager,2038080,2040000

14,"No no no , we didn't {disfmarker}",Project Manager,2042040,2044020
14,Or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,2044020,2044920

15,Right .,Project Manager,100980,101400
15,"this is our look and feel presentation , the final {disfmarker} our final presentation .",Industrial Designer,101400,106680
15,Mm 'kay .,Project Manager,106680,107220
15,And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um,Industrial Designer,107220,112140
15,'Kay . You able to look {gap} ?,User Interface,112140,114000
15,"It's gonna have a a plastic body {vocalsound} um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .",Industrial Designer,114000,124740
15,Yep . {gap},User Interface,124740,125400
15,This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing,Industrial Designer,125400,129240
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,129240,129720
15,"um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker} they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .",Industrial Designer,129720,136740
15,Okay .,Project Manager,136740,137100
15,"Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,137100,148380
15,{vocalsound} {gap} .,User Interface,148380,149580
15,"and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top",Industrial Designer,149580,161940
15,The black and white touch screen wherein people can {disfmarker},User Interface,161940,165780
15,Mm . So it's flush .,Project Manager,165780,166980
15,and the buttons at the bottom would d,Industrial Designer,166980,169200
15,Right .,User Interface,169200,169620
15,so so it'll fully close flat .,Industrial Designer,169620,171420
15,"Oh right , okay , yeah .",Project Manager,171420,172860
15,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,172860,173640
15,{gap} {gap},User Interface,173640,174300
15,"{vocalsound} And working on the inside we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries , which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,174300,191820
15,"So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,",Project Manager,191820,195540
15,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,195540,196320
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,196320,196800
15,'cause it's the top part that's {disfmarker} okay .,Project Manager,196800,199860
15,"Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound} and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .",Industrial Designer,199860,221040
15,{vocalsound} Or something . {vocalsound},Marketing,221040,223440
15,{vocalsound},User Interface,223440,224160
15,"{vocalsound} And then {disfmarker} yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .",Industrial Designer,224160,233460
15,{vocalsound},Marketing,233460,234180

15,Ah oka,User Interface,236100,236460
15,"Or , that would be too complicated .",Project Manager,236460,238620
15,"Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .",Industrial Designer,238620,256080
15,Infrared {gap} .,Project Manager,256080,257040
15,"Um it would it would have {disfmarker} obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . {vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker} we haven't {disfmarker} I don't think we actually put it on .",Industrial Designer,257040,289860
15,Like here .,Project Manager,289860,290520
15,"Yeah , yeah , something like that .",Industrial Designer,290520,292620
15,"Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here .",User Interface,292620,295200
15,"Okay . Actually , no , it would be {disfmarker} it would have to be on the on the front .",Project Manager,295200,300540
15,"Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .",Industrial Designer,300540,303780
15,"{gap} . So when it's {disfmarker} even if it's open here , the signals would go {gap} .",User Interface,303780,309000
15,"Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing ,",Project Manager,309000,313080
15,"So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,313080,317100
15,yes .,Project Manager,317100,317400
15,Yeah .,User Interface,317400,317760
15,"Yeah , that would make sense .",Project Manager,317760,319560
15,"And then finally um on to the interface . {vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen",Industrial Designer,319560,329100
15,{gap} This one right here .,User Interface,329100,330720
15,"which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .",Industrial Designer,330720,348120
15,{gap} .,User Interface,348120,348540
15,Okay .,Project Manager,348540,348900
15,"And now we've {disfmarker} we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .",Industrial Designer,348900,361440
15,Which is {disfmarker},User Interface,361440,362700
15,But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product,Project Manager,362700,366540
15,"No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing .",Industrial Designer,366540,373500
15,No .,User Interface,373500,373740
15,once it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,373740,375060

15,"This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .",Marketing,405000,460500

15,"{vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .

16,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing,441300,442800
16,this is definitely the best one .,Project Manager,442800,444780
16,{vocalsound},User Interface,444780,445500
16,Uh .,Industrial Designer,445500,445740
16,"Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Okay ,",Project Manager,445740,452280
16,Excuse me .,Industrial Designer,452280,452940
16,"that's {gap} . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,",Project Manager,452940,463800
16,Piece of cake .,User Interface,463800,464700
16,sorry .,Project Manager,464700,465120
16,Uh easy .,User Interface,465120,465660
16,"So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have {gap} a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the {gap} and everything , so just have a look how it {disfmarker} we think about remote controls .",Project Manager,465660,484200
16,"Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a {vocalsound} a universal remote control ?",Marketing,484200,489660
16,"Oh yeah , that's a good question .",Project Manager,489660,491700
16,"Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .",Marketing,491700,497520
16,"I think it's {disfmarker} I'm not I'm not sure ,",Project Manager,497520,500400
16,So I {disfmarker},Marketing,500400,501420
16,it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker},Project Manager,501420,504120
16,"Yeah , it probably would be universal .",Industrial Designer,504120,506460
16,Universal .,User Interface,506460,507120
16,Because {disfmarker} {gap},Marketing,507120,508680
16,And only television ? Or more devices ?,User Interface,508680,511020
16,"I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so {disfmarker} not sure , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,511020,518640
16,"Hmm , maybe , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,518640,520320
16,"Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros",Marketing,520320,525360

16,Ah okay .,User Interface,530580,531120
16,"Yeah , I think .",Marketing,531120,532080

16,"Yeah , everything",Project Manager,534900,535920
16,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,535920,536880
16,just {disfmarker} so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control .,Project Manager,536880,541320
16,"okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , probably .",Industrial Designer,541320,543540
16,Not just a T_V_ .,User Interface,543540,544560

16,Okay .,Marketing,547260,547620
16,"what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not {disfmarker} nothing very special , but um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,547620,556620
16,Well we can try to make it special .,User Interface,556620,558780

16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,560040,560760
16,{vocalsound},Marketing,560760,561480
16,So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound},Project Manager,561480,566400
16,Well {disfmarker},User Interface,566400,567420
16,"Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , {gap} {disfmarker} we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . {vocalsound} Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons .

16,Hmm yeah .,Project Manager,601320,601920
16,{vocalsound},User Interface,601920,602640

16,"{gap} It shouldn't be too big ,",User Interface,608820,610680
16,I dunno um {disfmarker},Marketing,610680,612060
16,"but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .",User Interface,612060,617580
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,617580,617940
16,We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .,User Interface,617940,621600
16,"Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .",Project Manager,621600,625200
16,Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .,User Interface,625200,630660
16,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,630660,631440
16,"Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,",User Interface,631440,634440
16,Yes,Marketing,634440,634620
16,maybe more trendy .,User Interface,634620,635760
16,But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open .,Project Manager,635760,639420
16,"Fold open ,",User Interface,639420,640080
16,"Okay ,",Project Manager,640080,640440
16,where you can see uh more options . I think {disfmarker},User Interface,640440,643800
16,"yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something ,",Project Manager,643800,647820
16,Yeah,Industrial Designer,647820,648060
16,Ah,Marketing,648060,648180
16,n,Industrial Designer,648180,648240
16,that's that's {disfmarker},Marketing,648240,649800
16,if you just {disfmarker},Project Manager,649800,651240
16,"Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .",User Interface,651240,658920
16,Ah right right .,Marketing,658920,659880
16,"Yeah , or you c",Industrial Designer,659880,660780
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,660780,661140
16,O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .,Industrial Designer,661140,665940
16,"Oh that's good , yeah .",Marketing,665940,667320
16,Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker},User Interface,667320,669000
16,Yeah .,Marketing,669000,669360
16,Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?,Project Manager,669360,672600
16,{vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,672600,675600
16,There are buttons on it .,Project Manager,675600,677100
16,No you can make an uh manual in it .,User Interface,677100,679260
16,"Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .",Industrial Designer,679260,682380
16,Okay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .,Project Manager,682380,686460
16,But that's {disfmarker},User Interface,686460,687840
16,Uh like a a to have {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,687840,689760
16,"Yeah , but",Marketing,689760,690360
16,"Yeah , I think it's much uh {disfmarker} too expensive .",User Interface,690360,693720
16,"Yeah , maybe it would .",Industrial Designer,693720,695100
16,"Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .",Marketing,695100,698220
16,{gap},Project Manager,698220,698520
16,"And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,",Marketing,698520,702300
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,702300,702660
16,because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .,Marketing,702660,709860
16,"Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .",Project Manager,709860,715560
16,"Yeah , too fragile .",User Interface,715560,716760
16,Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker},Marketing,716760,722040
16,No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound},Project Manager,722040,726300

16,{vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .,User Interface,727680,729180
16,{vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?,Industrial Designer,729180,731880
16,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,731880,732780
16,Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,732780,737040
16,"Oh maybe that's a good idea ,",Project Manager,737040,738780
16,Ma maybe a home station .,Marketing,738780,740280
16,"just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,",Project Manager,740280,743580
16,Yeah .,User Interface,743580,743940
16,you never have to use any batteries .,Project Manager,743940,746160
16,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer,746160,746700
16,"Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .",User Interface,746700,751500
16,"Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?",Project Manager,751500,755340
16,Yeah .,Marketing,755340,755700
16,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,755700,756660

16,I dunno .,Project Manager,760560,761100
16,"Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,",Industrial Designer,761100,765660
16,{vocalsound},Project Manager,765660,766380
16,Ah yeah .,Marketing,766380,766920

16,{gap},Marketing,771480,771780
16,Maybe have {gap} uh {disfmarker},User Interface,771780,773700
16,{vocalsound},Marketing,773700,774420
16,"Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .",Project Manager,774420,783360
16,"Yeah , 'cause well {disfmarker}",User Interface,783360,785220
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,785220,785580
16,"Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,",Marketing,785580,794760
16,"Yeah , that's right , yeah .",Project Manager,794760,796440
16,and now you can put it always at the same place .,Marketing,796440,799380
16,Yeah .,User Interface,799380,799740
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,799740,800100
16,"Maybe it's {disfmarker} Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .",Marketing,800100,804840

16,"Yeah . You can {disfmarker} yeah , you can buy it with it .",Marketing,808560,812100

16,Rechargeable .,User Interface,815640,816480

16,Yeah .,User Interface,822480,822840
16,"or you can change your batteries ,",Industrial Designer,822840,824880
16,Oh yeah .,Marketing,824880,825420
16,so .,Industrial Designer,825420,825660
16,"The option , just the option , that's cool .",Project Manager,825660,828300
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,828300,828660
16,"Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,",Marketing,828660,837540

16,"uh it has to lay good in the hand ,",Marketing,837900,840000
16,Yeah .,User Interface,840000,840360
16,you you have to uh {disfmarker},Marketing,840360,842220
16,Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control,Project Manager,842220,849660
16,"Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know",Marketing,849660,852060
16,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,852060,852960
16,"Well I think we have to look at that ,",User Interface,852960,855240
16,if we {disfmarker},Marketing,855240,856320
16,"'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}",User Interface,856320,861060
16,"You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,",Marketing,861060,864600
16,Yeah,Project Manager,864600,864840
16,but it's very hard to {disfmarker},Marketing,864840,866880
16,"N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .",Industrial Designer,866880,873000
16,"Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .",User Interface,873000,886020
16,Nah .,Marketing,886020,886320
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,886320,886680
16,"But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .",User Interface,886680,894480
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,894480,894840
16,"So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,",User Interface,894840,898980
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,898980,899340
16,so you can do something unique with that .,User Interface,899340,901860
16,"And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .",Industrial Designer,901860,913740
16,"Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .",Marketing,913740,915900

16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,920040,920400
16,"Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,",Marketing,920400,923220

16,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,924300,925080
16,"yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,",Industrial Designer,925080,931200
16,and if you fold it open {disfmarker},Marketing,931200,933360

16,{gap},Marketing,934920,935220
16,That's what I meant .,User Interface,935220,936480
16,so .,Industrial Designer,936480,936720
16,maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ?,Project Manager,936720,943500
16,Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .,Marketing,943500,951660
16,{gap} Maybe it's hard t,Project Manager,951660,953040
16,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,953040,953940

17,Marketing Experts . {vocalsound},Project Manager,17580,19500
17,Mm .,Marketing,19500,19740
17,"And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .",Project Manager,19740,34140
17,Okay .,User Interface,34140,34500
17,"Um , so you're participant two ?",Project Manager,34500,36420
17,One one .,Industrial Designer,36420,36960
17,No no no .,User Interface,36960,37560

17,Okay .,Marketing,46620,46980
17,"'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound}",Project Manager,46980,50100
17,In one .,User Interface,50100,50580
17,"In one , sorry {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,50580,52320
17,Yeah .,Marketing,52320,52680
17,Isn't that technical functions ?,Project Manager,52680,54600
17,No sure .,Marketing,54600,55140
17,So you didn't save it maybe .,Industrial Designer,55140,56880
17,Uh,Marketing,56880,57000
17,It's mine .,User Interface,57000,57660
17,it's David Jordan . Course .,Marketing,57660,59340
17,"Alright , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,59340,60840
17,{vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So,Project Manager,60840,62700
17,David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,62700,64860
17,Mm yeah .,User Interface,64860,65400
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,65400,65880
17,so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .,Project Manager,65880,69540
17,Okay .,User Interface,69540,69900
17,"No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .",Marketing,69900,73380
17,Uh .,Project Manager,73380,73620
17,Too great for email then .,Industrial Designer,73620,75180
17,"Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .",User Interface,75180,82260
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,82260,82620
17,Uh I I will focus on user interface design .,User Interface,82620,85260
17,Mm .,Project Manager,85260,85500
17,"Um so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide .",User Interface,85500,126240
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,126240,126960
17,So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So {disfmarker},User Interface,126960,137100
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,137100,137820
17,That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation .,User Interface,137820,141960
17,So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .,Project Manager,141960,146100
17,"Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions ,",User Interface,146100,148860
17,"So powerful ,",Project Manager,148860,149640
17,but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful .,User Interface,149640,152160
17,many functions and very easy to use .,Project Manager,152160,154380
17,Yes . Yep .,User Interface,154380,155040
17,"So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,",Marketing,155040,158040
17,To merge the two system huh .,Industrial Designer,158040,159780
17,I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple,Marketing,159780,163020
17,Yeah .,User Interface,163020,163380
17,Yeah .,Marketing,163380,163740
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,163740,164460
17,You mean this one ?,Project Manager,164460,165600
17,Yeah .,Marketing,165600,165960
17,"Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .",Project Manager,165960,170760
17,Mm yep .,Industrial Designer,170760,171240
17,{gap},Marketing,171240,171540
17,But But this is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,171540,173220
17,But if we have very very good user interface,User Interface,173220,175860
17,"Yeah ,",Marketing,175860,176220
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,176220,176580
17,and then {disfmarker},Marketing,176580,177840
17,it take less time for user to learn how to use it .,User Interface,177840,180900
17,Yeah .,Marketing,180900,181260
17,"Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign .",Industrial Designer,181260,191340
17,Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?,Project Manager,191340,195000
17,"Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .",Industrial Designer,195000,204780
17,"Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah . The user should know .",Marketing,204780,208500
17,"So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So .",Industrial Designer,208500,218340
17,Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker},Project Manager,218340,220620
17,Yeah . So .,Industrial Designer,220620,221280
17,"Go on , go back and {disfmarker}",Project Manager,221280,223200
17,"Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .",Industrial Designer,223200,228720
17,"Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . {vocalsound}",Marketing,228720,231540
17,"Yeah , that's my job . {vocalsound}",User Interface,231540,233640
17,{vocalsound} That's your job {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,233640,236100
17,That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .,User Interface,236100,239100
17,{vocalsound},Marketing,239100,239820
17,It you {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,239820,241740
17,"So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use .",Project Manager,241740,246420
17,Yep .,User Interface,246420,246720
17,Okay .,Marketing,246720,247080
17,Okay .,Project Manager,247080,247440
17,Powerful and easy to use .,User Interface,247440,249000
17,So that's the point .,Marketing,249000,250260
17,"Yeah , that's the point .",User Interface,250260,251760
17,"So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .",Project Manager,251760,255900
17,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer,255900,256680
17,So you you're {disfmarker},Project Manager,256680,258240
17,Participant two . Yeah .,Industrial Designer,258240,259680
17,Um . Okay .,Project Manager,259680,260340
17,{gap},Marketing,260340,260640
17,"{vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,260640,264960
17,"So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay .",Project Manager,264960,268080
17,"So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the",Industrial Designer,268080,283860
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,283860,284340
17,"how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based",Industrial Designer,284340,292920
17,Mm .,Marketing,292920,293160
17,"but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_",Industrial Designer,293160,302820
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,302820,303540
17,{vocalsound},Marketing,303540,304260
17,"so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,304260,314400
17,True .,Marketing,314400,314760
17,So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?,Project Manager,314760,318180
17,"I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,318180,321240
17,Okay .,Marketing,321240,321600
17,"Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen ,",Project Manager,321600,326940
17,What the cost is ?,Marketing,326940,328020
17,yeah . The cost {disfmarker},Project Manager,328020,329700
17,"Twelve , twelve a half .",Marketing,329700,331140
17,"Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here",Industrial Designer,331140,354120
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,354120,354600
17,and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .,Industrial Designer,354600,357120
17,That might just {disfmarker} So .,Marketing,357120,359100
17,You can go to the next slide .,Industrial Designer,359100,360900
17,Okay .,Project Manager,360900,361260
17,"I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff",Industrial Designer,361260,371100
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,371100,371460
17,"you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .",Industrial Designer,371460,377220
17,What is this ?,Project Manager,377220,378060
17,This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .,Industrial Designer,378060,383940
17,Okay .,Project Manager,383940,384300
17,Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .,Industrial Designer,384300,389280
17,Okay .,Project Manager,389280,389640
17,"So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .",Industrial Designer,389640,415320
17,Okay .,Project Manager,415320,415680
17,Okay .,Marketing,415680,416040
17,"Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?",Industrial Designer,416040,419220
17,What's the average price of this technology then ?,Marketing,419220,422220
17,"Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the",Industrial Designer,422220,430440
17,"So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}",User Interface,430440,436560
17,"{vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .",Industrial Designer,436560,455880
17,Okay .,User Interface,455880,456240
17,So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .,Project Manager,456240,464820
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,464820,465540
17,{vocalsound} Okay . Okay .,User Interface,465540,467100
17,"{vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu",Project Manager,467100,473400
17,But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker},Marketing,473400,480480
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,480480,481200
17,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,481200,482340
17,{vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .,User Interface,482340,485400
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,485400,486360
17,"I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,",Marketing,486360,490260
17,"Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,",Industrial Designer,490260,493320
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,493320,494040
17,but in a sense {disfmarker},Marketing,494040,495660
17,sometime I want to have wire because you know .,Industrial Designer,495660,498480
17,"Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?",Project Manager,498480,507660
17,{gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,507660,508740
17,{vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?,Project Manager,508740,512820
17,"Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .",Industrial Designer,512820,516780
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,516780,517500
17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,517500,519000
17,{vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound},Project Manager,519000,522060
17,Okay .,User Interface,522060,522420
17,"Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,522420,530160
17,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,530160,531300
17,"{vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .",Industrial Designer,531300,537960
17,"Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .",Project Manager,537960,542700
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,542700,543180
17,The wire ?,Marketing,543180,543780
17,As it's {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,543780,545400
17,Yeah . True .,Marketing,545400,546180
17,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,546180,546960
17,I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .,Project Manager,546960,555780
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,555780,556260
17,Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker},Marketing,556260,558780
17,"{vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .",Project Manager,558780,561000
17,Now the {disfmarker},Marketing,561000,562200
17,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,562200,563100
17,"Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .",Industrial Designer,563100,587340
17,{vocalsound} So,Project Manager,587340,588240
17,Okay .,User Interface,588240,588600
17,just think of um the usability .,Project Manager,588600,590520
17,Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound},User Interface,590520,593340
17,Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?,Project Manager,593340,599100
17,Yeah .,User Interface,599100,599460
17,Yeah .,Marketing,599460,599820
17,"I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,",Project Manager,599820,606060
17,"Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True .",Marketing,606060,609240
17,yeah .,Project Manager,609240,609600
17,This you will see in my presentation then .,Marketing,609600,612180
17,"{vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .",Project Manager,612180,615840
17,Yeah .,Marketing,615840,616200
17,Okay {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,616200,617340
17,"Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .",Marketing,617340,628920
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,628920,629640
17,"Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .",Marketing,629640,646920
17,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,646920,647400
17,"Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}",Marketing,647400,659460
17,"You mean the loo the look , the outside ?",Project Manager,659460,661920
17,"The look , how it look like .",Industrial Designer,661920,663660
17,"Yeah , the the look is is bad for them",Marketing,663660,665940
17,Okay .,Project Manager,665940,666300
17,"so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .",Marketing,666300,681000
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,681000,681360
17,"So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,",Marketing,681360,719100
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,719100,719580
17,remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .,Marketing,719580,722820
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,722820,723540
17,"So this is from the experiments we've done ,",Marketing,723540,726180
17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager,726180,727680
17,"so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .",Marketing,727680,744720
17,{vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ?,Project Manager,744720,746460
17,"R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .",Marketing,746460,753780
17,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,753780,754920
17,Ah um okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager,754920,756420
17,"Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .",Marketing,756420,774240
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer,774240,774600
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,774600,775080
17,"And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,",Marketing,775080,781740
17,Functions .,User Interface,781740,782400
17,this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .,Marketing,782400,786000
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer,786000,786360
17,So {disfmarker},Marketing,786360,787260
17,"Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?",Project Manager,787260,801300
17,Yeah .,User Interface,801300,801660
17,Sure ? Yeah ?,Project Manager,801660,802440
17,"Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .",User Interface,802440,808620
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,808620,808980
17,So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .,User Interface,808980,812160
17,"Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?",Project Manager,812160,815040
17,But I'm not sure {disfmarker},User Interface,815040,816780
17,Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .,Project Manager,816780,823080
17,"Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the",Marketing,823080,826020
17,The manuals .,Industrial Designer,826020,826800
17,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,826800,827160
17,manual .,Marketing,827160,827640
17,I think the {disfmarker},Project Manager,827640,829080
17,It's {disfmarker},Marketing,829080,830100
17,"No you you can have a switch menu , so you can",User Interface,830100,832860
17,"Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .",Project Manager,832860,834960
17,"well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .",User Interface,834960,850860
17,"Yeah , okay . Okay ,",Project Manager,850860,852060
17,"Then you you put the switch button ,",User Interface,852060,854220
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,854220,855180
17,"then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .",User Interface,855180,866160
17,With a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,866160,867300
17,"So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .",User Interface,867300,877740
17,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,877740,879120
17,"But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny .",User Interface,879120,885900
17,Look fancy .,Industrial Designer,885900,886620
17,{gap},Marketing,886620,886920
17,"This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} .",Industrial Designer,886920,894240
17,Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .,User Interface,894240,898680
17,Yeah .,Marketing,898680,899040
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,899040,899760
17,"Yeah , this is something we sh",Marketing,899760,901560
17,"Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so .",User Interface,901560,910560
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,910560,911040
17,"But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .",Marketing,911040,915420
17,I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,915420,922500
17,"Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .",Project Manager,922500,927720
17,"Specially distribution , yeah .",Marketing,927720,929580
17,"Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .",Industrial Designer,929580,931740
17,If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .,Project Manager,931740,936240
17,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,936240,937140
17,"Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker}",User Interface,937140,940620
17,"Yeah , it will cost little bit more .",Project Manager,940620,942840
17,"Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,",User Interface,942840,946560
17,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,946560,947760
17,some people prefer black remote control .,User Interface,947760,950220
17,"Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .",Marketing,950220,953580
17,And also f,Project Manager,953580,954180
17,"Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,",User Interface,954180,957540
17,Yeah .,Marketing,957540,957900
17,"so user can select which colour they prefer , so .",User Interface,957900,960900
17,"Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,",Project Manager,960900,965880
17,"Yeah ,",Marketing,965880,966240
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,966240,966720
17,remember it's twelve Euros .,Marketing,966720,968400
17,"and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .",Project Manager,968400,990900
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,990900,991380
17,Hmm .,Marketing,991380,991680
17,"And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .",Project Manager,991680,998940
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,998940,999420
17,So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about,Project Manager,999420,1003620
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1003620,1003980
17,and to discuss it with uh the other members .,Project Manager,1003980,1006680
17,"Yeah , hmm .",Industrial Designer,1006680,1007400
17,Yeah .,User Interface,1007400,1007760
17,"So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?",Project Manager,1007760,1011600
17,"Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .",Marketing,1011600,1021740
17,Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker},Project Manager,1021740,1023780
17,So .,Marketing,1023780,1024020
17,"So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1024020,1043460
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,1043460,1043940
17,It's is uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,1043940,1045320
17,"Lame , or {disfmarker}",Marketing,1045320,1046640
17,"No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .",Project Manager,1046640,1052700
17,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,User Interface,1052700,1053600
17,"So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,",Project Manager,1053600,1058760
17,Yep .,Industrial Designer,1058760,1059060
17,"and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .",Project Manager,1059060,1076940
17,Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},User Interface,1076940,1078800

17,Mm-hmm,Marketing,1080600,1080960
17,because if we want to to do remote control,Project Manager,1080960,1083480
17,Mm .,User Interface,1083480,1083720
17,"which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?",Project Manager,1083720,1099920
17,Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .,User Interface,1099920,1103400

17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1166880,1167600
17,This is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1167600,1168800
17,I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .,Marketing,1168800,1172460
17,"Maybe not ,",Project Manager,1172460,1173120
17,It's maybe more in browsing .,Marketing,1173120,1174860

18,'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,0,43140
18,"Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,43140,72660

18,This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,79380,81420
18,Yeah .,User Interface,81420,81780
18,So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .,Industrial Designer,81780,90480
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,90480,91200
18,"The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .",Industrial Designer,91200,95280

18,'S a very bright strawberry . {vocalsound},Project Manager,102600,105120
18,"So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .",Industrial Designer,105120,117120
18,It's been a l,User Interface,117120,117900
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,117900,118620
18,"It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .",User Interface,118620,133920
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,133920,134400
18,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,134400,134940
18,"And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}",User Interface,134940,146520
18,Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .,Industrial Designer,146520,149580
18,Okay so that's just {disfmarker},User Interface,149580,151500
18,And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere,Industrial Designer,151500,154380
18,So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker},User Interface,154380,160800

18,Yeah .,User Interface,764820,765180
18,"{vocalsound} Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .",Project Manager,765180,772740
18,I didn't {disfmarker} yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker},User Interface,772740,779220
18,Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .,Industrial Designer,779220,784140
18,"But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .",User Interface,784140,787380
18,Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?,Project Manager,787380,790380
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,790380,791100
18,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,791100,793020
18,"Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,",User Interface,793020,797640
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,797640,798000
18,like you could probably do a strawberry still .,User Interface,798000,800820
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,800820,801180
18,I think the broccoli would be out .,User Interface,801180,803280
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,803280,804000
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,804000,804720
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,804720,805440
18,"You could do {gap} , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like {disfmarker} sorta like a joystick .",User Interface,805440,812820
18,"Yeah that I I {disfmarker} when you were holding that before , it actually looked {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,812820,818880
18,Yeah . That looked really good .,Marketing,818880,820800
18,I don't know . So {disfmarker},User Interface,820800,822600
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,822600,823320
18,"Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?",Marketing,823320,826380
18,Uh .,User Interface,826380,826620
18,Not that I can think of . Rhubarb . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,826620,829500
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,829500,830220
18,{vocalsound} Rhubarb .,User Interface,830220,831540
18,{vocalsound} I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .,Marketing,831540,835200
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,835200,835920
18,{vocalsound} These obscure fruits .,User Interface,835920,838020
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,838020,838380
18,Uh despite the {disfmarker},Marketing,838380,840000
18,{vocalsound} I think we needn't {disfmarker},User Interface,840000,842640
18,What if um the {disfmarker} it was just patterns on like {disfmarker} we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .,Project Manager,842640,854100
18,Huh ?,User Interface,854100,854400
18,You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .,Project Manager,854400,857820
18,Oh okay .,User Interface,857820,858360
18,"So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .",Industrial Designer,858360,862500
18,Yeah . That could work .,User Interface,862500,863940
18,Yeah . {gap},Marketing,863940,864660
18,Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,864660,868980
18,Yeah .,User Interface,868980,869340
18,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager,869340,870480
18,Yeah . I dunno .,User Interface,870480,871440
18,But if we if we need {disfmarker},Project Manager,871440,873420
18,Yeah and just have the colour match or something .,Marketing,873420,876420
18,"yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be {disfmarker}",Project Manager,876420,881700
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,881700,882420
18,{vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker},Project Manager,882420,889200
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,889200,889920
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,889920,890640
18,Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .,User Interface,890640,895500
18,Mm . {vocalsound},Project Manager,895500,896520
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,896520,897240
18,Mm .,Marketing,897240,897480
18,"Or like {disfmarker} I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think {disfmarker} see as like {disfmarker}",User Interface,897480,903600
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,903600,904320
18,"like you could {disfmarker} if it was only this {disfmarker} you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .",User Interface,904320,916800
18,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager,916800,917580
18,So like maybe that's just too big,User Interface,917580,919560
18,"Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,",Project Manager,919560,924240
18,because {disfmarker},User Interface,924240,925440
18,which is a nice kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,925440,927600
18,Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .,User Interface,927600,929580
18,Yeah .,Marketing,929580,929940
18,yeah . But {disfmarker},Project Manager,929940,931320
18,{gap} I dunno .,User Interface,931320,932220
18,I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?,Project Manager,932220,935940
18,I guess {disfmarker},User Interface,935940,937140
18,'Cause like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,937140,939060
18,"We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .",Industrial Designer,939060,944880
18,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,944880,945660
18,Yeah .,User Interface,945660,946020
18,Yeah .,Marketing,946020,946380
18,Or like even {disfmarker},Project Manager,946380,947880
18,Dif,User Interface,947880,948060
18,We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .,Industrial Designer,948060,952080
18,"Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?",Project Manager,952080,957180
18,Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .,User Interface,957180,964080
18,"'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .",Project Manager,964080,968820
18,Yeah .,User Interface,968820,969180
18,And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .,Project Manager,969180,972540
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,972540,973020
18,Yeah .,Marketing,973020,973380
18,Mm .,User Interface,973380,973620
18,"And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .",Project Manager,973620,979860
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,979860,980580
18,Yeah . Yeah . Alright .,User Interface,980580,981960
18,But I mean it {disfmarker} do we have any other ideas about that ?,Project Manager,981960,985920
18,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,985920,986820
18,We could tr I don't know .,User Interface,986820,988380
18,"Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one . {vocalsound} . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,",Marketing,988380,995880
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,995880,996600
18,which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .,Marketing,996600,1000920
18,The batteries are going in the back ?,Project Manager,1000920,1003140
18,That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .,Industrial Designer,1003140,1010640
18,No .,Marketing,1010640,1010880
18,The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker},Project Manager,1010880,1019160
18,"No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,",Industrial Designer,1019160,1021920
18,no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager,1021920,1025820
18,yeah um like on a normal remote .,Industrial Designer,1025820,1027800
18,Right .,Project Manager,1027800,1028220
18,"So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .",Industrial Designer,1028220,1036560
18,Okay .,Project Manager,1036560,1036920
18,I think everyone's under three anyway .,Marketing,1036920,1039260
18,Mm .,Project Manager,1039260,1039500
18,So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .,Marketing,1039500,1043400
18,Cool . Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .,User Interface,1043400,1046820
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1046820,1047540
18,{vocalsound} Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .,Industrial Designer,1047540,1050720
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,1050720,1051860
18,Okay .,Project Manager,1051860,1052220
18,"Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,1052220,1056480
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1056480,1057200
18,{vocalsound} We were a bit off task .,User Interface,1057200,1059420
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,1059420,1060140
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1060140,1060860
18,Um so uh I can't think of any {disfmarker} So we'll have to like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm .,User Interface,1060860,1066560
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1066560,1067280
18,"Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,",User Interface,1067280,1075020
18,It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .,Industrial Designer,1075020,1080180
18,but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .,User Interface,1080180,1083360
18,"Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .",Project Manager,1083360,1088040
18,Yeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .,User Interface,1088040,1089840
18,I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .,Industrial Designer,1089840,1094760
18,Yeah . Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .,Project Manager,1094760,1101720
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1101720,1102440
18,Hmm .,User Interface,1102440,1102740
18,"Mm . {vocalsound} Not really {disfmarker} Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . {vocalsound} Um so project evaluation .",Project Manager,1102740,1111800
18,Do you want this and we can all {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .,Marketing,1111800,1115520
18,"I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied {disfmarker} oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah .",Project Manager,1115520,1123800
18,It's alright yeah ?,Marketing,1123800,1124940
18,Um {disfmarker} Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of {disfmarker},Project Manager,1124940,1130640
18,Sure .,Industrial Designer,1130640,1131000
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,1131000,1131360
18,I did .,User Interface,1131360,1131780
18,I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? {vocalsound},Project Manager,1131780,1136400
18,Yeah .,Marketing,1136400,1136760
18,{vocalsound} Sponginess . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1136760,1139040
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,1139040,1139760

18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1142880,1143600
18,and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria {vocalsound} .,User Interface,1143600,1149180
18,And how was our leadership and teamwork ? {vocalsound},Project Manager,1149180,1152420
18,I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .,Industrial Designer,1152420,1159380
18,Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .,Project Manager,1159380,1162380
18,"{vocalsound} Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .",Industrial Designer,1162380,1167840

18,I think you were fine .,User Interface,1173120,1174500

18,"Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .",Project Manager,1182660,1185900
18,Yeah we didn't {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} uh it all c sort of blended quite well .,Marketing,1185900,1190940
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,1190940,1191300
18,"Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like {vocalsound} I don't know , all had ideas about it but {disfmarker}",User Interface,1191300,1201680
18,"Yeah . Very democratic . No spats , that was good .",Project Manager,1201680,1204740
18,{vocalsound} yeah .,User Interface,1204740,1205880
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1205880,1206600
18,No . {vocalsound},User Interface,1206600,1207620
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,1207620,1208340
18,"{vocalsound} Um and the means for like {disfmarker} the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,",Project Manager,1208340,1216680
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1216680,1217400
18,I mean we used {disfmarker},Project Manager,1217400,1219020
18,"Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .",Industrial Designer,1219020,1223520
18,Are you a Mac person ? {vocalsound},Project Manager,1223520,1225620

18,{vocalsound},Marketing,1227600,1228320
18,"I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .",Industrial Designer,1228320,1233600
18,Huh .,Project Manager,1233600,1233900
18,Hmm .,User Interface,1233900,1234200
18,Which isn't very user-friendly though . {vocalsound},Marketing,1234200,1237320
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,1237320,1238040
18,Yeah . {vocalsound} Well the problem is if you don't {disfmarker} like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now . But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .,Industrial Designer,1238040,1254900
18,"I felt like my {disfmarker} I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my {disfmarker} the information that was available to me was kind of just like {disfmarker} or maybe it was just the idea that we had .

18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1275840,1276560
18,Mm .,Project Manager,1276560,1276800
18,"So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations ,",User Interface,1276800,1284960
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,1284960,1285320
18,so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .,User Interface,1285320,1287900
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,1287900,1288260
18,"But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , {vocalsound} think it's kinda stupid .",User Interface,1288260,1293960
18,Yeah . I never use it .,Industrial Designer,1293960,1295340
18,Yeah but uh {disfmarker},User Interface,1295340,1296780
18,I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Like I {disfmarker},Project Manager,1296780,1301160
18,Yeah .,User Interface,1301160,1301520
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1301520,1301880
18,It didn't really {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,1301880,1304040
18,It {disfmarker},Project Manager,1304040,1304940
18,My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .,Industrial Designer,1304940,1310160
18,I though it was brilliant no ? {vocalsound},Marketing,1310160,1312740
18,Really ? {vocalsound},Project Manager,1312740,1314000
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,1314000,1314720
18,No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .,Marketing,1314720,1318860
18,I mean m my problem {disfmarker},Project Manager,1318860,1320780
18,{vocalsound} Yeah it probably does .,Industrial Designer,1320780,1322940
18,So like a f,User Interface,1322940,1323600
18,I think it depends on the role,Marketing,1323600,1325400
18,"yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,1325400,1326180
18,Yeah I think so .,User Interface,1326180,1327200
18,no ?,Marketing,1327200,1327440
18,"'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like {disfmarker} they'd put {disfmarker} send you to sites and stuff right ?",Project Manager,1327440,1334880
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,1334880,1335240
18,"See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like {disfmarker}",Project Manager,1335240,1343580
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1343580,1344300
18,"you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things ,",Project Manager,1344300,1349760
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,1349760,1350480
18,'cause I {disfmarker},Project Manager,1350480,1351740
18,Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control .,Industrial Designer,1351740,1359480
18,Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,1359480,1361040
18,As if you'd wanted to .,Industrial Designer,1361040,1362420
18,Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um,Marketing,1362420,1366800
18,System . Yeah .,Project Manager,1366800,1367700
18,"a whole system ,",Marketing,1367700,1368660
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,1368660,1369380
18,'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the {disfmarker},Marketing,1369380,1375320
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,1375320,1375680
18,"Yeah I mean , it {gap}",User Interface,1375680,1377000
18,"Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,1377000,1387500
18,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing,1387500,1388280
18,"Yeah , huh .",Project Manager,1388280,1389000
18,It seems planned you know .,Industrial Designer,1389000,1390620
18,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager,1390620,1391760

18,Yeah .,Project Manager,1408200,1408560
18,I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um {disfmarker},User Interface,1408560,1412700
18,Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like {disfmarker} we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?,Project Manager,1412700,1423860

18,If I hadn't been told that fruit was {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,1428360,1431300

18,Hm .,User Interface,1563060,1563300
18,And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know .,Industrial Designer,1563300,1569300
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,1569300,1569660
18,It's like the {disfmarker} there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .,Industrial Designer,1569660,1575120
18,Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration .,Project Manager,1575120,1577820
18,It seems like way overkill .,Industrial Designer,1577820,1579500

19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,400380,401100
19,Uh just let me check .,Marketing,401100,402420
19,"So , four point {disfmarker} three point five , it means it's acceptable .",Industrial Designer,402420,406860

19,Th this th th there's two two functions .,User Interface,526560,529020
19,"Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Wait th that's the second point .",Marketing,529020,532620
19,This is microphone array {disfmarker},User Interface,532620,534840
19,First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .,Marketing,534840,538140
19,If it is fancy or not .,Industrial Designer,538140,539520
19,Okay . Is it better like that ?,Project Manager,539520,541380
19,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing,541380,543300
19,"Looks {disfmarker} okay ,",Project Manager,543300,544800
19,So we can we can say t,Industrial Designer,544800,546120
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,546120,546840
19,let's say it's a pineapple now . {vocalsound},Project Manager,546840,549540

19,"{vocalsound} No , the colour is okay , that's fine .",Marketing,551880,555000
19,So the shape now .,Industrial Designer,555000,556080
19,I mean it's {disfmarker},Marketing,556080,557520
19,It looks like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Project Manager,557520,559980
19,but I would say there is more {disfmarker} too much red .,Marketing,559980,563400
19,now you took it .,Project Manager,563400,564420
19,It's too much red ?,Industrial Designer,564420,565560
19,Um if,Marketing,565560,565860
19,In the basement ?,Industrial Designer,565860,566880
19,It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top .,Project Manager,566880,569640
19,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface,569640,570780
19,"{vocalsound} Right . So , from one to seven ?",Marketing,570780,573480
19,{vocalsound} I will give {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,573480,576900
19,{vocalsound} Mm uh {disfmarker} Seven is the ma the maximum ?,Project Manager,576900,580560
19,I'll gi,Industrial Designer,580560,580980
19,"No , seven is false and one is true .",Marketing,580980,583200
19,I'll give two or three .,Industrial Designer,583200,584640
19,"Three , I will say three .",Project Manager,584640,586200
19,"Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .",Industrial Designer,586200,589680
19,Three ?,Marketing,589680,590100
19,'Kay,User Interface,590100,590340
19,Okay .,Marketing,590340,590700
19,Isn't it bitter like that {gap} ?,Project Manager,590700,592680
19,Three .,Marketing,592680,593100
19,Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface,593100,594840
19,Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker},Marketing,594840,597240
19,What other {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,597240,598620
19,The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .,Marketing,598620,603360
19,Is it easy to use ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,603360,605280
19,Feasible ? {vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an,Project Manager,605280,611100
19,Ye uh {disfmarker} Embedded .,Industrial Designer,611100,612840
19,"Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact .",User Interface,612840,615420
19,"It's a micro array , okay .",Industrial Designer,615420,617040
19,There four microphone .,User Interface,617040,618420
19,"Oh . Okay ,",Project Manager,618420,619080
19,So they they they they {disfmarker} there's a microphone array .,User Interface,619080,622920
19,and you have the {disfmarker} there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?,Project Manager,622920,628800
19,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,628800,629580
19,And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?,Project Manager,629580,634080
19,"So you can capture voice {disfmarker} yeah , you c",User Interface,634080,637080
19,"Oh yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,637080,638040
19,"Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .",User Interface,638040,642120
19,"And I think you {disfmarker} you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is {disfmarker} I",Industrial Designer,642120,648180
19,"Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .",Marketing,648180,653520
19,"{vocalsound} W Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,653520,655800
19,We have tactile buttons .,Project Manager,655800,657300
19,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,657300,657780
19,"I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,657780,661740
19,"No , that's good . Yeah .",Marketing,661740,663240
19,That's good .,Industrial Designer,663240,664020
19,"Oh , yeah .",Project Manager,664020,664680
19,"Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe {disfmarker} okay .",Marketing,664680,668880
19,"I think technically it's acceptable , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,668880,672060
19,Maybe two ?,Project Manager,672060,672720
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,672720,673080
19,"So using the same scale , two ?",Marketing,673080,674940
19,Two ? I would say two,Project Manager,674940,676200
19,"Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .",Industrial Designer,676200,678600
19,. You agree ?,Project Manager,678600,679380
19,"Yeah , I agree .",User Interface,679380,680340

19,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,682740,684240
19,Now maybe the most critical one .,Marketing,684240,686220
19,Okay .,Project Manager,686220,686580
19,{vocalsound} Most {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,686580,688380
19,{vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ?,Marketing,688380,692580
19,"Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking .",Industrial Designer,692580,697440
19,"Yeah , it's very easy .",User Interface,697440,698820
19,You just need the command .,Industrial Designer,698820,700440
19,You can use this in this way .,User Interface,700440,702240
19,Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker},Marketing,702240,707700
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,707700,708420
19,As a principle . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,708420,710160
19,Yeah .,User Interface,710160,710520
19,{vocalsound} Please .,Marketing,710520,711780
19,Th this is the base .,User Interface,711780,713040
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,713040,713760
19,So you can turn to change the channel .,User Interface,713760,716100
19,Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?,Marketing,716100,720600
19,You just tu turn d d,User Interface,720600,721800
19,I think maybe if you he,Industrial Designer,721800,723180
19,"Oh , ok I understand .",Project Manager,723180,724500
19,Like if you want to go from {disfmarker},Marketing,724500,726900
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,726900,727620
19,"You take take {vocalsound} the remote , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,727620,730920
19,If you hear some click {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,730920,733020
19,and you can turn like that to change the channel ? {vocalsound},Project Manager,733020,736800
19,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface,736800,737580
19,Yeah but imagine you y,Marketing,737580,738900

19,{vocalsound},User Interface,744060,744780
19,"Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?",Marketing,744780,752820
19,"Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .",Industrial Designer,752820,756300
19,Yeah .,User Interface,756300,756660
19,"How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? {vocalsound}",Marketing,756660,760380
19,"No , no , no . I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker}",User Interface,760380,763560
19,Yeah .,Marketing,763560,763920
19,it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker},User Interface,763920,767040
19,Yeah . I agree . I agree .,Marketing,767040,768600
19,Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,768600,772920
19,But I mean if you're fro from two ?,Marketing,772920,775020
19,"I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .",User Interface,775020,781680
19,I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,781680,784200
19,"Yeah , you have a {vocalsound} , like that , and so on .",Project Manager,784200,787560
19,So change . Yeah .,User Interface,787560,788640
19,And you you can {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,788640,790320
19,Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker},Marketing,790320,794280
19,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,794280,794820
19,Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree .,User Interface,794820,800340
19,We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,800340,802560
19,So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker},User Interface,802560,806340
19,Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker},Project Manager,806340,811440
19,"I think you can if you have a scale , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,811440,814620
19,"No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn ,",User Interface,814620,820440
19,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,820440,820920
19,then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker},User Interface,820920,826020
19,Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?,Marketing,826020,829980
19,"It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker}",User Interface,829980,835500

19,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .",User Interface,838740,840900
19,I don't think so . {vocalsound},Marketing,840900,842760
19,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's a bit difficult .",Industrial Designer,842760,845280
19,"I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it . {vocalsound} I think so , you can just change .",User Interface,845280,851160
19,"I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,851160,857460
19,Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker},Marketing,857460,864600
19,"There's uh also a number , you know .",User Interface,864600,866820
19,"Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .",Project Manager,866820,887340
19,"Uh , yeah , and y that's {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer,887340,889980
