0,I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer .,Industrial Designer
0,"Okay . Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . {vocalsound} Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to {disfmarker} um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um {vocalsound} so we're gonna try out our white board . If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . Okay .",Project Manager
0,So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ?,User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Project Manager
0,I think both . {vocalsound},Marketing
0,Yeah . Both . Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
0,Okay . Why don't we do both . Right .,User Interface
0,Who starts ? We ought to decide who starts and {vocalsound} all that . No ?,Marketing
0,Any volunteers ?,Project Manager
0,Uh-huh .,Marketing
0,Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh {disfmarker} Does it have to be {vocalsound} functional , trendy and user friendly ? {vocalsound}",User Interface
0,{vocalsound} I don't think so .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"Um . Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one .",User Interface
0,{gap},Project Manager
0,"Make sure {gap} my things here . Uh-oh . Right . Okay , my favourite animal is {disfmarker} see . {vocalsound} Oops .",User Interface
0,A dolphin .,Project Manager
0,"Yeah , it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}",User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound} 'S like playing Pictionary .,Project Manager

0,{vocalsound} So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,I like its tail .,User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"{vocalsound} Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh {disfmarker} I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like {disfmarker}",User Interface
0,{vocalsound} They're graceful .,Project Manager
0,"they're graceful yeah , and they're so {disfmarker}",User Interface
0,Sleek {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound} Yeah they're sleek,User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"and they look intelligent and I don't know , they're {disfmarker} I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing .",User Interface
0,I don't know how intelligent that one looks {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"Yeah he he doesn't look that smart {vocalsound} . He's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I dunno um they're {disfmarker} I think it's cool the the um {vocalsound} the interaction that or the th things that {disfmarker} the reasons people seem to like you know {disfmarker} you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like {vocalsound} {disfmarker} but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . {gap} {vocalsound}",User Interface
0,Yes . {vocalsound} Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ?,Project Manager
0,"Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah .",Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},User Interface
0,Uh-oh there goes the ten .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound} It's a cat . {vocalsound},Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},User Interface
0,"I don't know . They sleep all day , {vocalsound} they're easy to draw {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound} Do you wanna {gap} anything ?,Project Manager
0,Uh yeah .,Marketing
0,I dunno if the the {disfmarker},Project Manager
0,I think the pen is running out of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
0,"Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one .",Marketing
0,ah .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,So I'll use the spare one . Um but it's harder to draw {gap} um .,Marketing
0,And the pen's dying {vocalsound} .,User Interface
0,Um .,Marketing
0,A horse .,Project Manager
0,Horse .,User Interface
0,"Uh . Um I don't {vocalsound} really know how the legs go ,",Marketing
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,That's very good .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"but anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um {disfmarker}",Marketing
0,{gap} Yeah . This cord's {disfmarker} {gap} Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet {vocalsound} . Uh {disfmarker} It's a pig .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound},Marketing
0,"{vocalsound} So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is {disfmarker}",Project Manager
0,And furry .,User Interface
0,"yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .",Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"Textile {disfmarker} tactile , {vocalsound} tactile remote control .",User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Marketing
0,{vocalsound} Although {disfmarker} uh I'll just put there . Right .,Project Manager
0,You're dragging a {disfmarker} you have a tail {vocalsound} .,User Interface
0,"{gap} Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country {vocalsound} . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .",Project Manager
0,Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ?,User Interface
0,Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .,Project Manager
0,Okay .,User Interface
0,"How many should we sell then ? {vocalsound} Um , a lot ,",Marketing
0,Anyone a mathematician ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
0,"two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million .",Marketing
0,Two million .,Industrial Designer
0,Four million . And it {disfmarker},Marketing
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .",Marketing
0,"Oh , yeah .",Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh .,Marketing
0,"So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .",Project Manager
0,"Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find",Marketing
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,I was thinking that too .,User Interface
0,bec yeah {vocalsound} bec,Marketing
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,"I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,",User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"I've always wanted that ,",User Interface
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker},User Interface
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .",Marketing
0,"I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .",User Interface
0,Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .,Marketing
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
0,In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker},Marketing
0,Yeah .,User Interface
0,I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker},Marketing
0,I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker},User Interface
0,Maybe call is enough . But yeah .,Marketing
0,"just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}",User Interface
0,Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah .,Marketing
0,"What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base ,",Project Manager
0,"Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah .",User Interface
0,like just to have a home for it .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,Yeah yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing
0,"Yeah ,",User Interface
0,"{vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
0,I mean {disfmarker},User Interface
0,{vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch .,Industrial Designer
0,Yeah .,User Interface
0,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
0,"Yeah , in in the couch {vocalsound} .",User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Marketing
0,{gap},Project Manager
0,"I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker}",User Interface
0,Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
0,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls .,User Interface
0,"{vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive .",Marketing
0,Yeah .,User Interface
0,"But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .",Marketing
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,Yeah .,User Interface
0,Something like that .,Marketing
0,"Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?",Project Manager
0,And the other thing is {disfmarker},Marketing
0,Bigger .,User Interface
0,Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker},Marketing
0,"Like Hand hand held size , yeah .",Project Manager
0,Hand-sized .,User Interface
0,Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker},Marketing
0,"Not not huge , but {vocalsound}",Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .,Marketing
0,It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .,User Interface
0,"No , it can't be , uh-uh .",Marketing
0,No it really wouldn't be .,Industrial Designer
0,Huh .,Project Manager
0,Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound},User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound} Like spaceship .,Marketing
0,. Yeah {vocalsound} . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound},Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .,User Interface
0,Little homing device . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Uh .,User Interface
0,Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes .,Project Manager
0,Oh dear .,Marketing
0,"Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}",Project Manager
0,"I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,",User Interface
0,"Yeah , I agree .",Industrial Designer
0,'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker},User Interface
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,"{vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .",Industrial Designer
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah .",Marketing
0,"I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .",User Interface
0,"You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does .",Project Manager
0,That would be cool .,User Interface
0,Yeah .,Marketing
0,Yeah . I mean it just seems like {disfmarker},User Interface
0,"So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
0,yeah .,User Interface
0,what do you call it {disfmarker},Project Manager
0,Select . Uh .,Marketing
0,"s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s",Project Manager
0,"But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .",Marketing
0,That's something we could decide . Mm .,Project Manager
0,Because {disfmarker},Marketing
0,I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno .,User Interface
0,"Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,",Marketing
0,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
0,and then use the telly as a screen .,Marketing
0,Right .,Project Manager
0,But um {disfmarker},Marketing
0,I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker},User Interface
0,"But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,",Marketing
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,is that what you mean ?,Marketing
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,Right . Mm .,Marketing
0,"Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker}",User Interface
0,Yeah .,Marketing
0,must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .,User Interface
0,Mm .,Project Manager
0,But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .,Marketing
0,"Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true .",User Interface
0,"Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point {disfmarker} twelve fifty for {disfmarker} to actually make the device .",Project Manager
0,Yeah .,Marketing
0,Mm .,User Interface
0,"Um but it's something to think about , yeah .",Project Manager
0,"Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .",User Interface
0,I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .,Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},User Interface
0,Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker},Marketing
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,"Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}",Marketing
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,What was the word ?,Marketing
0,Furry .,User Interface
0,Water resistant .,Marketing
0,Oh I was just {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},User Interface
0,"No but it's {disfmarker} I thought , ah , spot on .",Marketing
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,"Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel ,",Marketing
0,Yeah .,Project Manager
0,maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .,Marketing
0,"Yeah . Mm , mm .",User Interface
0,That's quite annoying .,Marketing
0,"Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}",Project Manager
0,Yeah .,User Interface
0,like that's another {disfmarker},Project Manager
0,"Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um .",Marketing
0,"Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ ,",Project Manager
0,Yeah I think so .,Industrial Designer
0,"yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ?",Project Manager
0,User .,Industrial Designer
0,"Yeah , what does it stand for again ?",Project Manager
0,"That's me . Uh , User Interface design .",User Interface
0,User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w,Project Manager
0,So technical function .,User Interface
0,The working design is the structure .,Industrial Designer
0,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
0,What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker},User Interface
0,"Um , I guess you'd have to find out {vocalsound} .",Project Manager
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
0,{gap},User Interface
0,Um .,Industrial Designer
0,It says on that email but it {disfmarker},Marketing
0,It was in the email .,Industrial Designer
0,It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker},User Interface
0,I wrote down what mine were .,Industrial Designer
0,It said um {disfmarker},Marketing
0,Yeah .,User Interface
0,It said {disfmarker},Marketing
0,"{vocalsound} What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright .",User Interface
0,Yeah,Marketing
0,And working design .,User Interface
0,like {disfmarker},Marketing
0,Okay .,User Interface
0,"Be a medium between you and the telly I think ,",Marketing
0,"Yeah , yeah . Alright .",User Interface
0,Mm .,Project Manager
0,that's uh {disfmarker},Marketing
0,"And how it works , okay . Right . I'm I'm on task .",User Interface
0,"And the M_E_ , what does that stand for {vocalsound} ? M",Project Manager
0,Marketing .,Industrial Designer
0,"Marketing , right . Um {vocalsound} .",Project Manager
0,"Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um .",Marketing
0,"So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker} Yeah .",Project Manager
0,Okay .,Marketing
0,So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . I just did .,Project Manager
1,That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button .,User Interface
1,Like this one .,Industrial Designer
1,"But uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers .",User Interface
1,"It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that .",Industrial Designer
1,Okay .,Project Manager
1,"They n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them",Industrial Designer
1,"Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well ,",Project Manager
1,"Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device .",Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager
1,It's it's quite easy .,Industrial Designer
1,"Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ?",Project Manager
1,"Yes , rubber ?",Industrial Designer
1,And the buttons ?,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound} Plastic or rubber .,User Interface
1,{vocalsound} There are plastic or rubber .,Industrial Designer
1,"Well ,",User Interface
1,"Okay ,",Project Manager
1,yeah .,User Interface
1,and uh the colouring ?,Project Manager
1,Uh yellow with uh,Industrial Designer
1,{gap} with with grey or black .,Project Manager
1,grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,we'll we'll come to that later . Um,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,okay . Anything else to add or {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,No . {vocalsound} Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound} But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,"Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button ,",Marketing
1,"Yes , but it {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels .,Marketing
1,"but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .",Industrial Designer
1,M uh yeah .,Project Manager
1,Or not ?,Industrial Designer
1,"M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .",Project Manager
1,You {disfmarker},Marketing
1,"Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .",Industrial Designer
1,And a button for disabling the voice recognition .,User Interface
1,"Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,User Interface
1,"but o okay , that that's not really really important .",Project Manager
1,"{vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype .",User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,The basic {disfmarker} okay . Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?,Project Manager
1,Yes .,Marketing
1,Okay .,Project Manager
1,Uh my name is not name,Marketing
1,{vocalsound} You are nameless . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,but {disfmarker},Marketing
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . And these uh were the most important criteria .",Marketing
1,{vocalsound} Is it spongy ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,"It should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah ,",Marketing
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So {disfmarker},Marketing
1,"So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy . {vocalsound}",User Interface
1,Uh well appar,Marketing
1,I believe it's fancy too .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet .",Marketing
1,No .,Project Manager
1,"Oh , sorry .",User Interface
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing
1,"Okay , so",Project Manager
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria .,Project Manager
1,"Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .",Marketing
1,"Okay , well {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,So uh,Marketing
1,the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,that's about it .,Marketing
1,The production costs . The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,Twenty two .,User Interface
1,"Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty .",Project Manager
1,Yikes .,User Interface
1,"And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that ,",Project Manager
1,Well it's very expensive .,Industrial Designer
1,because it's not that important .,Project Manager
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,"Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa",User Interface
1,"Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .",Project Manager
1,yeah . The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface
1,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,"Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,And and does it {disfmarker},User Interface
1,"if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,",Project Manager
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
1,because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .,Project Manager
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
1,"Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .",Project Manager
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
1,"So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .",Project Manager
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So it's c way too expensive .,Industrial Designer
1,"It's still too expensive , yeah . Um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,But that's that's only for the buttons .,User Interface
1,"I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,So the button we can use plastic .,User Interface
1,oh . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,And uh maybe not use the special form .,Project Manager
1,"And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .",User Interface
1,But it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,"{vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .",Project Manager
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,But it's the board decision . Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
1,"Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .",Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic",Project Manager
1,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1,and uh m maximise the profits,Project Manager
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,and um {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,but that's not what uh has been asked .,Industrial Designer
1,"I know , I know .",Project Manager
1,So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .",Project Manager
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
1,Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .,Project Manager
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,"Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative .",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,Or however you s pronounce that .,Project Manager
1,"Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound}",User Interface
1,"Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .,Project Manager
1,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1,Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Marketing
1,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager
1,"Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .",Industrial Designer
1,We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .,Project Manager
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,Is it fancy ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?,Marketing
1,"Yeah , I think so .",Project Manager
1,"Um the yellow rubber , I think so .",User Interface
1,I think so .,Industrial Designer
1,"{vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound},User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,So uh one ?,Marketing
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,But it's not that fancy .,Industrial Designer
1,"No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .",Project Manager
1,I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . It would be even more {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,You like tita {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,That's a flavour as well .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"It has flavour . Yes , that's right . {vocalsound} You should taste it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} Right . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"Yeah , I know ,",Project Manager
1,Is it uh {disfmarker},Marketing
1,but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"It has to do with fashion , I guess .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface
1,So do {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,And w,Marketing
1,yeah .,User Interface
1,"yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials .",Marketing
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy .,Marketing
1,It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
1,"Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two .",User Interface
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,"It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker}",User Interface
1,"I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .",Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,"{vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two .",User Interface
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , I I agree .",Project Manager
1,"Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good .",Industrial Designer
1,"Okay , and uh was it innovative ?",Marketing
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"Well ,",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker},User Interface
1,Yep .,Marketing
1,"No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .",Project Manager
1,"Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product .",Industrial Designer
1,Okay .,User Interface
1,So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"{vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think .",User Interface
1,"No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing
1,That would have been a thrill .,Project Manager
1,"yes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,So uh also a uh two ?,Marketing
1,I think uh it's a two .,Industrial Designer
1,Yep .,Project Manager
1,Is it easy to use ?,Marketing
1,I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure .,Project Manager
1,Yeah .,User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,"Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .",User Interface
1,"{vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .,Industrial Designer
1,I think {disfmarker} I think a three .,User Interface
1,So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .,User Interface
1,Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .",Marketing
1,Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .,Project Manager
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?,Project Manager
1,"Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,Um {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager
1,"After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,"Uh Roo , a three ?",Project Manager
1,Yep .,User Interface
1,Ruud ?,Project Manager
1,Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .,Marketing
1,Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .",Industrial Designer
1,So I could make it e easy ?,Project Manager
1,If you make it a four it will be three in general .,User Interface
1,"So that's w No , two and a half .",Industrial Designer
1,If he makes it a four . Not a three .,User Interface
1,Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,Darn . Nee .,User Interface
1,Yes . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,Hmm ? Huh ?,Marketing
1,Roo . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,"A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .",User Interface
1,Yeah . I yeah {gap} .,Marketing
1,A four and a three together .,User Interface
1,{vocalsound} Four ?,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?",User Interface
1,"Yeah ,",Marketing
1,Two ?,Industrial Designer
1,"two , two , three {disfmarker}",Marketing
1,"No ,",Project Manager
1,And a three ?,User Interface
1,I haven't said anything yet .,Project Manager
1,Nee . I know .,User Interface
1,No . {vocalsound},Marketing
1,"Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .",Project Manager
1,Divided by four .,Industrial Designer
1,Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
1,But I'm filling in a three .,Project Manager
1,That's not even {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,"But that's not possible to fill in ,",Industrial Designer
1,"Yes , it is .",Project Manager
1,so we have to round it . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound},Marketing
1,"{vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .",Project Manager
1,"Yeah ,",User Interface
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,"we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .",User Interface
1,It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
1,"Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
1,Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,"I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
1,"something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
1,But even without it {disfmarker},User Interface
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,"Well , I uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,"So , I th",Industrial Designer
1,"we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .",Project Manager
1,Yeah .,User Interface
1,Um Sebastian ?,Project Manager
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , me too .",Industrial Designer
1,Me too .,User Interface
1,"Yeah , I agree .",Marketing
1,"Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,"Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .",Industrial Designer
1,Was it one of our options ?,User Interface
1,"No , it's not one of our option ,",Industrial Designer
1,No . Uh,Marketing
1,"No okay , but but",Project Manager
1,"So , in the in {disfmarker}",User Interface
1,"but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound},Marketing
1,"for the options given , it's the most spongy one .",Project Manager
1,"Uh yes ,",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,User Interface
1,"but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .,User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"Yes , but it's not good enough ,",Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} I'll give it a one .,Project Manager
1,so it's a two .,Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one .,User Interface
1,You take one ? What do you give it ?,Industrial Designer
1,"Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker}",Marketing
1,"Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
1,but {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing
1,Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time .,Project Manager
1,"Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .",Marketing
1,It will be a one . {vocalsound},User Interface
1,So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .,Marketing
1,"No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} You are {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,okay .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,The remote control offers enough features .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?",Project Manager
1,"Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker}",Marketing
1,{vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , depends .",Marketing
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager
1,So it's quite advanced .,Industrial Designer
1,What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .",User Interface
1,I think it has .,Project Manager
1,Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat,Marketing
1,"Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,",Project Manager
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,"you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .",Project Manager
1,Has uh the signals sent to it .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,User Interface
1,Signal .,Marketing
1,"So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .",Project Manager
1,Absolutely .,Industrial Designer
1,"Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .",Project Manager
1,"Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .,Industrial Designer
1,Yep .,Project Manager
1,You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .",Project Manager
1,I'll give a two .,User Interface
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one .",Industrial Designer
1,"Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker}",Marketing
1,"Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .",Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,"So high quality , low acceptance .",Project Manager
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
1,"The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure .",Project Manager
1,Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
1,D do you agree ?,Project Manager
1,"Yes , I agree . I {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .,Marketing
1,{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?,User Interface
1,Twenty five Euros .,Project Manager
1,Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .,User Interface
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ?",User Interface
1,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1,So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker},User Interface
1,M about fifty Euros .,Industrial Designer
1,yeah .,User Interface
1,That's quite ex,Industrial Designer
1,"That's price , but w w",User Interface
1,"well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .",Industrial Designer
1,"No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
1,"Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .",Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .",User Interface
1,"Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .",Project Manager
1,"Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition,Industrial Designer
1,{gap} .,Project Manager
1,and this one does .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So I think it's worth its price .,Industrial Designer
1,Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh",Marketing
1,That's counting .,Project Manager
1,"Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .",Industrial Designer
1,"should be about one point s seven ,",Marketing
1,Four six seven eight .,User Interface
1,yeah .,Marketing
1,Okay .,Project Manager
1,Nine divided by six .,User Interface
1,"Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um {disfmarker} What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ?",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,{vocalsound} Try to translate that . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,Hmm . {vocalsound},User Interface
1,"Any any other {disfmarker} Uh , Roo ?",Project Manager
1,"Yeah , I think uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
1,"Well , I think {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,Ye,Marketing
1,{vocalsound} Roo . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound} The process was good .,User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .,User Interface
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made",User Interface
1,"Mm . Actually , we had {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1,the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker},User Interface
1,Better decision .,Project Manager
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,yeah .,User Interface
1,We had we had too little information actually .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"So {disfmarker} And uh um the the the {disfmarker} well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow .",Industrial Designer
1,Less . Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,So we could we we could be {disfmarker} we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .,Project Manager
1,Well {disfmarker} Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,The prices .,Marketing
1,"Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,We we thought of possibilities {vocalsound} who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"We're tempered by that , yes .",Industrial Designer
1,"Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ?",Project Manager
1,"No , no .",User Interface
1,Ruud ?,Project Manager
1,I agree .,Marketing

1,Response,User Interface
1,The response is very slow,Industrial Designer
1,and {disfmarker},User Interface
1,and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate .,Industrial Designer
1,Okay . Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,"Uh it it has {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its {disfmarker} um uh where it uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
1,Draws .,Marketing
1,"Yeah , where it draws . It's uh {disfmarker} the drawing on on the b on the board is {gap} r right from the pen .",User Interface
1,"Okay , so",Project Manager
1,So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
1,"it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ?",Project Manager
1,You to take in account that your {disfmarker} you m,User Interface
1,Uh yeah .,Project Manager
1,yeah uh {disfmarker},User Interface
1,Maybe it's {disfmarker} it needs to be calibrateds .,Industrial Designer
1,It's too slow {disfmarker},User Interface
1,"It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting .",Project Manager
1,It is ?,Industrial Designer
1,"So uh it's not the calibration ,",Project Manager
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,"it's the thing itself , I think .",Project Manager
1,Hmm .,User Interface
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,"Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ?",Project Manager
1,No .,Marketing
1,Not at all .,Project Manager
1,Not really .,Marketing
1,"Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing ,",Project Manager
1,I I think so too .,Industrial Designer
1,although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .,Project Manager
1,Yep .,User Interface
1,Yes . Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,"If it has O_C_R_ {vocalsound} , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it .",User Interface
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh {disfmarker},User Interface
1,To digitise them .,Project Manager
1,"Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it .",User Interface
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,I type faster than I write .,User Interface
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,So {disfmarker},User Interface
1,"But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy {disfmarker} it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,It's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic .,Industrial Designer
1,Economic .,User Interface
1,I know .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"Yeah . Okay . Um {disfmarker} What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?",Project Manager
1,"Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit ,",Marketing
1,"Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No .",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can't say much about it .,Marketing
1,"I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,Yeah .,User Interface
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
1,"No , or the other way around .",Marketing
1,"Or the other way around , that you could show {disfmarker} but m",Project Manager
1,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer
1,But y you can {disfmarker},User Interface
1,That's quite what PowerPoint does .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Marketing
1,I know .,Project Manager
1,"if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .",User Interface
1,"I know , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,So it's almost {disfmarker},User Interface
1,"I know , but we couldn't use that feature ,",Project Manager
1,yeah .,User Interface
1,so I missed it .,Project Manager
1,Yep .,User Interface
1,We weren't able to do that . At least the {disfmarker} um I wasn't explained how to do such a th,Project Manager
1,Mm-hmm . {gap} . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object .,User Interface
1,"An object , yes . Yes .",Industrial Designer
1,I it's not possible {disfmarker},User Interface
1,The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .,Industrial Designer
1,yeah .,User Interface
1,Okay .,Project Manager
1,"And and uh w you were {disfmarker} when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing .",Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1,Oh it looks like paint actually .,User Interface
1,"Okay , so y it {disfmarker} it's not even as advanced as paint .",Project Manager
1,Not not uh n not {gap} way .,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,{vocalsound} It's quite uh limited .,Industrial Designer
1,Okay . Uh no . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,"Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product .",Project Manager
1,"Okay . Oh , very good , celebration .",Industrial Designer
1,Celebrate,Project Manager
1,Great . {vocalsound},User Interface
1,Pop uh pop up the champagne . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,Okay . {vocalsound} Um,Project Manager
1,It was a privilege working with you . {vocalsound},User Interface
1,you're dismissed . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"No , I think we are uh ready .",Project Manager
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,To private rooms ? {vocalsound},User Interface
1,I see some action over there .,Industrial Designer
1,"Private room , Roo . That sounds quite scary .",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,"No , let's find uh the way to {gap} . {vocalsound} {gap} .",Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,"{gap} uh we're done , we're finished , {gap} I believe . So , are there any more cycles in this process ? I think not .",Industrial Designer
1,"I don't believe so . Well , maybe we'd {disfmarker} get an email . Thank you for your {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,But um how much time did we get for this meeting ?,Industrial Designer
1,Forty minutes .,Project Manager
1,And how much time is left ?,Industrial Designer
1,A minute or or ten maybe . M,Project Manager
1,Ten minutes .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , ten or five .",Project Manager
1,Okay . Okay .,Industrial Designer
1,"So , we can uh redesign our uh {disfmarker} Uh I would like to {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1,"{vocalsound} Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .",Industrial Designer
1,And no added value . At all .,Marketing
1,"No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market .",Industrial Designer
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing
1,Oh .,Project Manager
1,"But you see the problem ,",User Interface
1,Yeah .,Project Manager
1,"y you can't continue your uh your line . Well , it's fluffy alright . {vocalsound} Spongy . A giraffe ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound}",User Interface
1,What is that ?,Industrial Designer
1,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,It's a giraffe eating a {disfmarker} eating leaves from a tree .,Industrial Designer
1,It's blue tongue .,Project Manager
1,In interesting design .,Marketing
1,Yeah . {vocalsound} This is a new model . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,Blue tongue . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,{vocalsound} Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling .,Marketing
1,{vocalsound} It's spongy . {vocalsound},Project Manager
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1,Yeah . {vocalsound},Marketing
1,{gap} . {vocalsound} That is uh {disfmarker} it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
1,{vocalsound},User Interface
1,{vocalsound} Blue tongue .,Industrial Designer
1,{vocalsound},Marketing
1,{vocalsound} Right .,User Interface
1,Okay . Let's wrap it up .,Industrial Designer
1,"Yeah , we're done here .",Project Manager

2,'Kay .,Marketing
2,Okay . {gap},Project Manager
2,Oh .,Marketing
2,Put it on in that way .,Project Manager
2,Oops .,User Interface
2,Thanks . Okay .,Project Manager
2,Mm .,User Interface
2,"Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .",Project Manager
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,After lunch . Yeah .,User Interface
2,"Right um this is our conceptual design meeting ,",Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,"um {vocalsound} I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,",Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,"Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well .",Industrial Designer
2,I th I I think {disfmarker} yeah um .,Project Manager
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,"This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .",Project Manager
2,Etcetera .,Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,"So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a {disfmarker} leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,",Project Manager
2,{gap},User Interface
2,"things like that ,",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .",Project Manager
2,'Kay .,User Interface
2,"Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?",Project Manager
2,Shall I ?,Marketing
2,Yep .,User Interface
2,Yes if you feel {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,Okay . We just connect up .,Marketing
2,{gap},Project Manager
2,"Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,",Marketing
2,{vocalsound},User Interface
2,It's okay {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,"sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .",Marketing
2,Yeah .,Project Manager
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .",Marketing
2,'Kay .,User Interface
2,Okay thank you very much . Um,Project Manager
2,Yep .,User Interface
2,let's start from the inside and work our way out .,Project Manager
2,Fine . It's okay with me .,User Interface
2,"Yeah , okay . {gap}",Industrial Designer
2,Unless anyone has any questions about that ?,Marketing
2,"I don't think so , not yet .",Project Manager
2,Not yet ? 'Kay .,Marketing
2,"Um , yes , thank you .",Project Manager
2,That screwed in ? {gap},Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Marketing
2,I hate those little things,Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .,Project Manager
2,{vocalsound} I know .,Marketing
2,"'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .",Industrial Designer
2,'Kay . {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
2,"Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .",Industrial Designer
2,'Kay .,Project Manager
2,Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .,Industrial Designer
2,{vocalsound},Marketing
2,"There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,",Industrial Designer
2,Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?,Project Manager
2,people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .,Industrial Designer
2,"Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .",Project Manager
2,So you wind up your remote control before you use it .,Industrial Designer
2,{vocalsound},Marketing
2,"How {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what kind of {disfmarker} how l long can you get out of that ,",Project Manager
2,It might {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,"You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .",Industrial Designer
2,That doesn't count though does it ?,Project Manager
2,Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?,Marketing
2,I thought it was U_V_ like {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,No .,Industrial Designer
2,Artificial light ?,Marketing
2,Is it ? Alright i,Industrial Designer
2,"Any , any {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,Has to be solar .,Marketing
2,"Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or {disfmarker} and dynamo might take more space .",User Interface
2,Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .,Industrial Designer
2,I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .,Project Manager
2,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
2,"Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights",Project Manager
2,"Mm . Artificial light , no .",Marketing
2,"no , but I mean not many {disfmarker} you don't want to limit your market .",Project Manager
2,That's going to {disfmarker},Marketing
2,"I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .",Project Manager
2,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
2,"I know ,",Marketing
2,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,"different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .",Marketing
2,Yeah,Industrial Designer
2,Right .,User Interface
2,and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .,Industrial Designer
2,Night .,User Interface
2,"Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .",Project Manager
2,But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .,Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches,Industrial Designer
2,Yeah I've seen {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,"and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .",Industrial Designer
2,"And are these like uh {disfmarker} what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?",User Interface
2,"Um yeah it's {disfmarker} it charges into um some form of {disfmarker} it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .,Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,User Interface
2,And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out {gap} .,Industrial Designer
2,We c,User Interface
2,"But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,Yeah and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,"I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .",Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,Yeah but then again,Industrial Designer
2,Is it really gonna be enough ?,Project Manager
2,"I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .",Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it",Industrial Designer
2,So it's not {disfmarker} the draw on it isn't {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,and you put it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,Hmm .,Marketing
2,no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm . Mm .,Marketing
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?",Marketing
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
2,"I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging",Marketing
2,Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing,Industrial Designer
2,or the two things not compatible ?,Marketing
2,Like a dual kind of .,Project Manager
2,"but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .",Industrial Designer
2,Mm . So that affects the exterior design .,Marketing
2,Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .,User Interface
2,Expensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,"They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2,It's twelve point f,User Interface
2,I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?,Project Manager
2,"Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the {disfmarker} It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,",Industrial Designer
2,Solar .,Project Manager
2,'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y,Industrial Designer
2,Well they're not designed {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,"the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .",Industrial Designer
2,Practical-wise okay .,Project Manager
2,"Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,",Industrial Designer
2,You do get a bit of wear,Project Manager
2,they can t,Industrial Designer
2,but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?,Project Manager
2,"Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .",Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,Another question is like {disfmarker},User Interface
2,Again it de,Marketing
2,"sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .",User Interface
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
2,"A remote control , like ,",User Interface
2,W m yeah,Industrial Designer
2,so we have to s look at the life also .,User Interface
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,"so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .",Industrial Designer
2,"It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,",Marketing
2,"Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .",Industrial Designer
2,"i {vocalsound} it's not gonna add anything , okay .",Marketing
2,"Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?",Project Manager
2,Okay .,User Interface
2,Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker},Marketing
2,Well add it in to think about um,Project Manager
2,"right , okay .",Marketing
2,"because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than,Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,the eternal battle for control of the controls .,Project Manager
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,"It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,",Marketing
2,No .,Project Manager
2,it's not a thing that people are looking for,Marketing
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,So {disfmarker},User Interface
2,when we threw it open to the field yeah .,Marketing
2,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2,But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .,Marketing
2,"Okay , right .",Project Manager
2,"Okay , well I'll move on .",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .",Industrial Designer
2,"What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,"Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Project Manager
2,"if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit",Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,"but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .",Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,User Interface
2,"Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,"which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,"but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Marketing
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units",Industrial Designer
2,Second thing is {disfmarker},User Interface
2,"Hinged , yeah .",Project Manager
2,for the flip phone .,Industrial Designer
2,"yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .",User Interface
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,"So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,",User Interface
2,Yeah I th,Industrial Designer
2,or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker},User Interface
2,"Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,"it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .,Industrial Designer
2,It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .,Marketing
2,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
2,"I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,",Marketing
2,"Rubber , yeah .",Industrial Designer
2,"that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .",Marketing
2,And you can peel them off yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Yeah .,User Interface
2,"So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,",Project Manager
2,"Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .",Marketing
2,Something like {disfmarker},User Interface
2,"like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Alright .,User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,That could be a good idea .,User Interface
2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,It could {disfmarker} it would be comfortable to hold on also .,User Interface
2,Okay . Mm .,Project Manager
2,T,Industrial Designer
2,Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .,Marketing
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .,Project Manager
2,Mm . Yeah .,Marketing
2,Also the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,'Kay .,Project Manager
2,"just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the {disfmarker} I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch",Industrial Designer
2,"Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}",User Interface
2,display . Uh what what {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,"Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}",User Interface
2,Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,Uh-huh .,User Interface
2,"the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,",Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,User Interface
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .",Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,"I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}",Marketing
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Oh it would be flat inside .,Project Manager
2,"You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,",Industrial Designer
2,"yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .",Marketing
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .,Industrial Designer
2,Have I misunderstood you ?,Marketing
2,"It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,"but there'd be touch touch buttons ,",Industrial Designer
2,'Kay .,User Interface
2,"so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer
2,"I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .",Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,Is rubber . Mm .,Industrial Designer
2,Yeah .,Marketing
2,"Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .,Industrial Designer
2,Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
2,"I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .",Marketing
2,"Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out",Industrial Designer
2,Like one of the palm pop thing .,Project Manager
2,"but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,"Absolutely , f for somebody who {gap} very often , if he would {disfmarker}",User Interface
2,'cause I had {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,Yeah .,Marketing
2,It would have to be attached .,Project Manager
2,"They're easy to replace as well , cheap .",Marketing
2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
2,a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a {gap},User Interface
2,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .",User Interface
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
2,"Yeah just a thought {disfmarker} they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a {disfmarker}",Marketing
2,"Okay , we'll talk about that {disfmarker} so if you finish your {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,Yeah that's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,and we'll come back to that .,Project Manager
2,yeah that {disfmarker} that's the end of m my {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,"That's you , right okay .",Project Manager
2,"And just one small question before like you are {gap} , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .",User Interface
2,"Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,"I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate {disfmarker} you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,",Industrial Designer
2,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .,Industrial Designer
2,"I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .",Marketing
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
2,"If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?",Marketing
2,No .,Project Manager
2,And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display {disfmarker} th uh the remote control display thing .,Marketing
2,We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .,Project Manager
2,Um .,Industrial Designer
2,They don't look at themselves ? Just a thought .,Marketing
2,"Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
2,"Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}",Marketing
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,"it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .",Marketing
2,"Yeah , no , no .",Project Manager
2,{gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much,Marketing
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .,Marketing
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,'Kay .,Marketing
2,"I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,"but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2,Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror,Marketing
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , okay .",Project Manager
2,that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .,Marketing
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,"Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .",User Interface
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,"So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .,User Interface
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,"Like , some some people have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Here you see this ? This is on a {disfmarker} I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .",User Interface
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,and g graphic user interface,User Interface
2,Sorry what does that stand for ?,Marketing
2,Which means {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,"basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,",User Interface
2,Okay .,Marketing
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,which is {disfmarker},User Interface
2,If you if {disfmarker} yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .,Industrial Designer
2,Like you have on a l uh {disfmarker} icons or something y you have {disfmarker} is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .,User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"So basically {gap} not point or click {gap} {disfmarker} Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .",User Interface
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .",User Interface
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .",User Interface
2,Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?,Project Manager
2,{gap},User Interface
2,"'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"No you'd hold it {disfmarker} you don't {disfmarker} if you flip it open then you'd be {disfmarker} Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah .",Marketing
2,"Yeah . That's what I was just saying ,",Project Manager
2,"Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li",Industrial Designer
2,But {disfmarker},User Interface
2,and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top,Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,"and then be able to touch that for the {vocalsound} other controls ,",Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,Okay and you mean to the {disfmarker},User Interface
2,"so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that ,",Project Manager
2,And the lower distance .,User Interface
2,on the lower side .,Project Manager
2,Oh f perfect .,User Interface
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,Hmm .,Marketing
2,"So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the {disfmarker} for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it {disfmarker} this at a low cost , but for {disfmarker} like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound,User Interface
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh {disfmarker} you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also .,User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . My personal preferences would be like , as already {gap} uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh",User Interface
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh",User Interface
2,"Well , yeah we {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2,"I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .,User Interface
2,"I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ?",Project Manager
2,"This is central one , the one you {disfmarker}",User Interface
2,Or is that volume and channel ?,Project Manager
2,"yeah volume and channel . So keep that m {disfmarker} that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . This and voice recognition .",User Interface
2,"Okay . Right . Okay . Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on {disfmarker} Do we agree on the battery ?",Project Manager
2,The kinetic .,User Interface
2,Kinetic ?,Marketing
2,Yeah .,Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
2,so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .,Project Manager
2,Yeah I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,"It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a",Project Manager
2,I mean if {disfmarker} Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have,Industrial Designer
2,selling point .,Project Manager
2,"and also if they've got it {disfmarker} if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them ,",Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2,"uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .",Industrial Designer
2,I think the only,Project Manager
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,"I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,but I think pretty much we've used cheap {disfmarker} relatively cheap and simple things .,Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,The L_C_D_'s not cheap .,Project Manager
2,"Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one ,",Industrial Designer
2,Hmm .,Marketing
2,I mean they use them in calculators so .,Industrial Designer
2,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
2,Maybe we could start with the black and white .,User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,That that way we could upgrade later {gap} .,User Interface
2,And you could {disfmarker} yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
2,"Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,",Marketing
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,User Interface
2,"we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?",Marketing
2,Mm .,User Interface
2,Well you cou um .,Industrial Designer
2,Do you want like a back-up ?,Project Manager
2,"No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?",Marketing
2,K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch {disfmarker} a battery that goes in a watch .,Industrial Designer
2,"I oh I see . Right , okay , got you .",Marketing
2,"So it's a lot smaller , so it would {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2,"Got you on that okay , didn't realise .",Marketing
2,"Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Yeah .,User Interface
2,"So there's not a {disfmarker} really a decision to be made there , um . The buttons {disfmarker} what did you give us as our {disfmarker} The bare-board L_C_D_ or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,"Yeah the {disfmarker} well I think were {disfmarker} we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons ,",Industrial Designer
2,{gap},User Interface
2,on the on the on on the top one we're gonna,Industrial Designer
2,On the top one okay you've got the touch,Project Manager
2,{disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,okay and then {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,"On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .",Industrial Designer
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , okay .",Project Manager
2,Sorry could you repeat that last part ?,Marketing
2,"Um , okay on {disfmarker} we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .",Industrial Designer
2,L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . Okay .,Marketing
2,And for the {disfmarker} sorry .,User Interface
2,"No , it's fine .",Project Manager
2,"For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah",User Interface
2,"Plastic ,",Industrial Designer
2,"we could use the body ,",User Interface
2,For the inside .,Project Manager
2,okay .,Industrial Designer
2,"for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"Mm-hmm ,",Marketing
2,{gap},User Interface
2,"so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,",Marketing
2,Plast right .,User Interface
2,"{vocalsound} Oh I think so , I think so .",Project Manager
2,"okay . and it is just uh {disfmarker} although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,",Marketing
2,Mm no .,Industrial Designer
2,No I think I {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,just go for the colours .,Marketing
2,It's {disfmarker},User Interface
2,we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway,Project Manager
2,Okay .,Marketing
2,"um the fact {disfmarker} the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes ,",Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,"but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,The feel .,Marketing
2,yes . So we could just pick anything .,Project Manager
2,"'Kay . Mm-hmm . Is that going to be {disfmarker} this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,",Marketing
2,Uh I {disfmarker} it's different .,User Interface
2,It's just different,Project Manager
2,is that fancy {gap} ?,Marketing
2,"it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses ,",Project Manager
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,sort of beige and black,Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,"um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway ,",Project Manager
2,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2,or you want something that contrasts as {vocalsound} you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
2,"Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things .",Marketing
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,"This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more {disfmarker}",Marketing
2,"And you would just have an {disfmarker} across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2,"Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming {disfmarker} I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,",Marketing
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,Right .,User Interface
2,And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes {vocalsound},Project Manager
2,which is another beauty of it .,Marketing
2,"y you know , you could just go so far with it ,",Project Manager
2,You can you can just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2,{vocalsound},Marketing
2,"Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .",User Interface
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever ,",Project Manager
2,{vocalsound},Marketing
2,so I think that's quite a flexible thing .,Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,"And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case {disfmarker} casing {disfmarker} the case outside ,",User Interface
2,Yes .,Project Manager
2,it should be moulded {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} the design in such a way you can change it every time .,User Interface
2,"Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca",Industrial Designer
2,Mm .,Project Manager
2,"not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .",Industrial Designer
2,Okay . The rubber .,User Interface
2,"Yeah . Okay we've got five minutes , {vocalsound} um , or that might've been up for a while .",Project Manager
2,Fine .,User Interface
2,"Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah ,",Marketing
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2,Yeah .,User Interface
2,"{vocalsound} for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?",Marketing
2,"Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also",User Interface
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,because that {disfmarker} we are not {gap} for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost .,User Interface
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2,"So , are we looking at voice {gap} ?",User Interface
2,"Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,",Marketing
2,Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .,User Interface
2,is that right ?,Marketing
2,"For l yeah , the whistle .",User Interface
2,"Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah .",Industrial Designer
2,So we can {disfmarker} if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .,User Interface
2,And incorporating the company logo ?,Marketing
2,Yep .,User Interface
2,Have you {disfmarker},Project Manager
2,"Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design .",User Interface
2,Mm .,Marketing
2,Okay .,Project Manager
2,"'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product",Marketing
2,"Well they do ,",Project Manager
2,don't they ?,Marketing
2,but I think we can {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
2,Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .,Marketing
2,"well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising .",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Marketing
2,"Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,and that does the work for you .,Project Manager
2,Okay .,Marketing
2,"Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that",Project Manager
2,Okay .,Marketing
2,so I'm not worried about that .,Project Manager
2,"Okay . Did we {disfmarker} I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?",Marketing
2,Depending on how i {vocalsound},Project Manager
2,"Yeah , depending on the expense of it .",Industrial Designer
2,"I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so",Project Manager
2,"And they've got in stock , so yeah .",Industrial Designer
2,"um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards .",Project Manager
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2,Right I'm going to wrap it up there .,Project Manager
2,Okay .,Industrial Designer

Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh .",Project Manager
3,{vocalsound},Marketing
3,"The tool training is to try out the white board , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager

3,{vocalsound},User Interface
3,"it will uh be a an international remote control ,",Project Manager
3,Is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3,"as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um {disfmarker} with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with {vocalsound} remote const con controls ,",Project Manager
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3,{vocalsound},Marketing
3,"try to create something new and people would like to to buy . And {vocalsound} and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know {disfmarker} I suppose you know what you have to do . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
3,{vocalsound} Yeah . I I hope so {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3,And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .,Project Manager
3,"Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI",Marketing

3,Yeah .,Marketing
3,You you de you implement the core functions in the {disfmarker},User Interface
3,And i maybe you will transform it {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
3,I I think the user the user interface design is {disfmarker} he will design how the user will you know {disfmarker} the relation between the user and you know the remote control so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3,Use it . Make make {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface
3,"And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .",Industrial Designer
3,"Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design .",User Interface

3,"I design the user f user interface , you design the function .",User Interface
3,"Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .",Project Manager
3,Yeah .,User Interface
3,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing

3,and then thi this would {vocalsound} I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .,Marketing
3,yeah .,Project Manager
3,Ok Okay .,Industrial Designer
3,"And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific ,",Project Manager

4,{vocalsound},Marketing
4,Okay .,User Interface
4,Okay . {vocalsound},Marketing
4,"Um so {disfmarker} yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface
4,"Uh so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager

4,Okay .,User Interface
4,Mm . Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
4,"Functional requirements , yeah",User Interface
4,"Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .",Marketing

4,"Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it .",Marketing
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,Yes .,User Interface
4,"Okay it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements .",Marketing
4,The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
4,"Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .",Marketing
4,So,Project Manager
4,Um Martijn alr already said it .,Marketing
4,if we {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but {disfmarker} I don't think it's uh",Marketing
4,"Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,",Project Manager
4,reachable .,Marketing
4,then you're you're {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,"Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .",Marketing
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly .",Marketing
4,Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .,User Interface
4,"Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't {disfmarker} We we haven't {disfmarker} Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page .",Marketing
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager
4,"Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money . {vocalsound} But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . {gap}",Marketing
4,So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .,Project Manager
4,But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?,Marketing
4,"People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,",Project Manager
4,"I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,",Marketing
4,Yeah .,User Interface
4,because {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager
4,because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .,Marketing
4,It's too {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .",Marketing
4,"Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .",Marketing
4,"Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .",User Interface
4,"Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product . We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah . One of a kind , I think .",Marketing
4,"So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,",Project Manager
4,Unique .,User Interface
4,"{vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .",Marketing
4,but {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,But old people are not looking for that .,Project Manager
4,Uh I think mm {disfmarker},User Interface
4,Not really .,Project Manager
4,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .",Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,User Interface
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing
4,Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager
4,to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker},Marketing
4,"But uh we also have to stand out ,",User Interface
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"Sorry I thought about it , yes .",Marketing
4,"'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape ,",User Interface
4,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
4,so {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Okay , this was uh my presentation .",Marketing
4,Thanks .,Project Manager
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
4,I don't {disfmarker},Marketing
4,So,Project Manager
4,Yeah .,Marketing
4,"Paul , you can do the next one if you want .",Project Manager
4,You can ask some questions or something .,Marketing
4,Okay . Yeah well {disfmarker} Uh .,User Interface
4,"It's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,",Project Manager
4,There it is .,User Interface
4,isn't it ?,Project Manager
4,"Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .",User Interface
4,So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,"Yeah , I have it on the next page .",User Interface
4,Okay .,Project Manager
4,"But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control",User Interface
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh {disfmarker} Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .",User Interface
4,Okay .,Project Manager
4,"But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,"Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ?",Industrial Designer
4,"Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,",Project Manager
4,No y,User Interface
4,but not sure {gap} .,Project Manager
4,Well,User Interface
4,"It's a good idea , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,"it's {disfmarker} It was just a thought . So I'm , I u {disfmarker} I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .",User Interface
4,"Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?",Industrial Designer
4,Well uh,User Interface
4,Uh {gap} {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,"what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six .",User Interface
4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer
4,"So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,"Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .",Industrial Designer
4,Well if you said a favourite {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
4,Uh mayb for me it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,Well i,User Interface
4,"If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never .",Project Manager
4,Never ? Oh .,User Interface
4,"No , neither do I .",Industrial Designer
4,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,Oh are you ?,User Interface
4,And {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,"Okay now , m maybe not .",User Interface
4,"If I don't do it , maybe old people {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
4,"No , maybe elderly people uh . Right .",User Interface
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
4,They don't like new features . So maybe not .,User Interface
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
4,"Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable",User Interface
4,"It's not , it's still not {disfmarker} It's not anymore n uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,when {disfmarker} Not anymore for T_V_ .,User Interface
4,{gap},Project Manager
4,"Right , on off . {vocalsound} I dunno , miss {disfmarker} Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ .",User Interface
4,Um {disfmarker},Marketing
4,"Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need .",Project Manager
4,Is {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ?",Industrial Designer
4,Just the channel um uh {disfmarker} What I mean is uh {disfmarker},User Interface
4,I don't thi,Industrial Designer
4,Forward .,Marketing
4,"Li like a web browser ,",Industrial Designer
4,Six seven eight or five .,User Interface
4,"so {disfmarker} Oh , okay .",Industrial Designer
4,Just very simple .,Project Manager
4,But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button .,Industrial Designer
4,Um I dunno .,User Interface
4,"Uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,",Project Manager
4,I don't have {disfmarker} Uh I did {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
4,"Yeah ,",User Interface
4,No . Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
4,I don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .",User Interface
4,"And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ?",Project Manager
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"Normally you can press one , zero or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,A ten plus or {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,"Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .",User Interface
4,Okay .,Project Manager
4,To just keep it simple and standard uh features .,User Interface
4,"Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
4,Uh yeah mayb,User Interface
4,It gets some seconds .,Marketing
4,But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .,User Interface
4,Oh okay . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}",Marketing
4,So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .,User Interface
4,"Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
4,It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .,Marketing
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
4,"So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .",User Interface
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that {disfmarker} And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f,Project Manager
4,It's only for television now .,Marketing
4,So I I don't think so .,User Interface
4,No .,Project Manager
4,Uh I just thought of another one .,User Interface
4,No .,Marketing
4,Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .,User Interface
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker} But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,",User Interface
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,so you have,User Interface
4,"I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .",Industrial Designer
4,four arrows .,User Interface
4,Because you n almost never use menu button .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , okay ,",User Interface
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,but um {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , a mute button . Yes .",User Interface
4,"Maybe , not {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,Don't think so .,User Interface
4,I don't know where where you have to put it .,Project Manager
4,"Yeah well ,",User Interface
4,{vocalsound},Marketing
4,that's that's {disfmarker} I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use .,User Interface
4,Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .,Project Manager
4,And later we can d uh do the design .,User Interface
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
4,"Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .",User Interface
4,Yeah . Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours,Project Manager
4,Um {disfmarker} I dunno . Different colours um {disfmarker},User Interface
4,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow,Marketing
4,It's like a iMac or something .,Project Manager
4,or {disfmarker},Marketing
4,{vocalsound} Just to make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
4,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
4,Yeah . Well why not ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface
4,That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .,Marketing
4,"But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,"Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .",User Interface
4,"Oh , you just {disfmarker} I dunno what happened .",Project Manager
4,Oh .,User Interface
4,{gap},Marketing
4,Who ?,User Interface
4,"Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,They they're uh designed very well .,User Interface
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .",User Interface
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"But uh well , I think that's a good example .",User Interface
4,"Okay , {gap}",Project Manager
4,Okay .,Marketing
4,"we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it .",Project Manager
4,"Okay , sorry .",User Interface
4,Is it fin Are you finished ?,Project Manager
4,Well uh {disfmarker},User Interface
4,Okay .,Project Manager
4,"Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .",User Interface
4,"Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .",Industrial Designer
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
4,Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things,Industrial Designer
4,So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?,Project Manager
4,but {disfmarker} Yeah . I I think so . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
4,Uh j Is {disfmarker},User Interface
4,I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable .",Project Manager
4,Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?,User Interface
4,"Yeah , that's active .",Marketing
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"Or just a green one ,",Project Manager
4,So {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .",Project Manager
4,Yeah . Maybe uh {disfmarker},User Interface
4,I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , when you press it .",Industrial Designer
4,But if you {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,I it's it's just uh the the {disfmarker},Marketing
4,"Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,",Project Manager
4,Two ?,Industrial Designer
4,"and green is like it's okay , you press the button .",Project Manager
4,Mm .,Marketing
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
4,Maybe depends on uh {disfmarker},User Interface
4,Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager
4,Yes .,User Interface
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,Marketing
4,"Okay , we make it red .",Project Manager
4,But maybe {disfmarker},User Interface
4,So,Industrial Designer
4,Well,User Interface
4,I know .,Industrial Designer
4,we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .,User Interface
4,You have to {disfmarker} The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool . {vocalsound},Project Manager
4,{vocalsound} I I think uh the batteries will be uh {vocalsound} a little {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,"Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Oh ,",User Interface
4,{vocalsound} Empty .,Marketing
4,maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
4,"No , we have a recharger in it , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,Oh .,User Interface
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
4,If we can still make that then {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
4,Uh maybe .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red .",User Interface
4,{vocalsound},Marketing
4,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
4,It's just to indicate something's on .,User Interface
4,Yeah .,Marketing
4,Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .,Industrial Designer
4,But it's cool if it was green .,Project Manager
4,"Yeah . It's it's not very important ,",User Interface
4,"Green or red or whatever , it is cool . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
4,so yeah .,User Interface
4,"Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .",Industrial Designer
4,So mm {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work .",Industrial Designer
4,"So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,"No . I I uh {disfmarker} The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
4,Okay .,User Interface
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"An automatically search function for each television , or something .",Marketing
4,"That are working . Yeah , or {disfmarker} I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there .",Industrial Designer
4,"Well , I I use a universal uh remote control ,",User Interface
4,Uh I kno,Marketing
4,"and {gap} list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ .",User Interface
4,Yeah ? Okay .,Industrial Designer
4,"Oh , I have a modern one .",Marketing
4,{vocalsound},User Interface
4,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
4,"And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it ,",Marketing
4,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer
4,and then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code .,Marketing
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
4,It uh search uh the pattern for itself .,Marketing
4,"Okay ,",User Interface
4,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer
4,so we use that .,User Interface
4,So it uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,Yes .,Marketing
4,Yep .,User Interface
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,"I just say {disfmarker} Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking {disfmarker} There's just a short {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip .,Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .",Industrial Designer
4,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
4,"But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .",Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .",Industrial Designer
4,Changing the signal .,Marketing
4,"And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting",Industrial Designer
4,Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager
4,and then um it's working .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , that's the right uh option .",Marketing
4,Okay . Well uh the components .,Industrial Designer
4,{vocalsound},Marketing
4,"Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .",Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,Um that's connecting to all the components .,Industrial Designer
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager
4,"Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .",Industrial Designer
4,"Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .",Project Manager
4,"Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .",Industrial Designer
4,{gap},Marketing
4,But this one is producing infrared light,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
4,that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .,Industrial Designer
4,"So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
4,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,"Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .",Marketing
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .",Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah . Yeah , and {disfmarker}",Marketing
4,Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .,Project Manager
4,"Huh , that's a good idea .",Industrial Designer
4,Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .,Marketing
4,"Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .",Project Manager
4,"No , y Yeah .",User Interface
4,Okay .,Marketing
4,And it's {disfmarker} you also know which button you p,Project Manager
4,But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .,Marketing
4,"Yeah , that's right . But it {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,Everywhere in the r,Marketing
4,But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED .,Project Manager
4,"No I don't think so , but {disfmarker} Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else .",User Interface
4,"That looks different , yeah .",Project Manager
4,Yeah .,User Interface
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
4,"'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?,Marketing
4,"Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .",User Interface
4,"Yeah , okay .",Marketing
4,"Yeah , but mm like when you push it",Industrial Designer
4,"{gap} Yeah , then then won't {disfmarker} Then you won't see it .",User Interface
4,n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,It must be around it then .,Marketing
4,Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , then {disfmarker}",Marketing
4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah . Not not not not here , but here .",Marketing
4,Yeah . There . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,Maybe uh {disfmarker},Marketing

4,"Maybe what Paul said , uh under the {disfmarker} on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .",Marketing
4,"Yeah , and then you {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But you have to make a sound device in it then .",Project Manager
4,And also it's {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Yeah , there must be sound in it .",Marketing
4,But {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,"Okay , it shouldn't take much {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,I dunno .,Marketing
4,Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,"Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .",Marketing
4,Uh I th,User Interface
4,Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .,Industrial Designer
4,"Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .",Marketing
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
4,I think uh you also have uh {vocalsound} remote controls with a lot of options .,User Interface
4,So {disfmarker},Marketing
4,But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh {disfmarker},User Interface
4,Uh . We have to give our customers some extras .,Marketing
4,Yeah . I think we will save money with that .,User Interface
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
4,Okay . Are you almost finished or just {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,"Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .",Industrial Designer
4,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
4,Because I was short on time .,Industrial Designer
4,No worry .,Project Manager
4,But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more . So maybe you have to {disfmarker} Yeah ?",Project Manager
4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer
4,Okay .,Project Manager
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
4,"So this {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um {disfmarker} Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so ,",Project Manager
4,"No ,",Industrial Designer
4,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,"and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .",Industrial Designer
4,No .,Marketing
4,"Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,Yeah .,User Interface
4,Uh .,Marketing
4,We definitely should use it . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting .",Project Manager
4,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing
4,Oh . Mm .,Industrial Designer
4,"Okay , that's {disfmarker} It changes things .",User Interface
4,I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well .,Project Manager
4,{vocalsound},Marketing
4,So does it make some decision about that ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
4,Changes .,Marketing
4,{vocalsound},User Interface
4,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,Um {disfmarker},User Interface
4,That kinda changes the whole situation .,Industrial Designer
4,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
4,"Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,",User Interface
4,That still stays .,Project Manager
4,to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .,User Interface
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,That's important I think and {disfmarker},User Interface
4,L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .,Marketing
4,"And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it .",User Interface
4,Oh .,Marketing
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,So {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Mm ah {disfmarker} I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
4,"Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . {vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker}",Marketing
4,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .",User Interface
4,{vocalsound} No .,Industrial Designer
4,"So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . What other features can we put in ?",User Interface
4,"Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the {disfmarker} Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .",Industrial Designer
4,But uh some of you had uh something to read about um {vocalsound} uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?,Marketing
4,I didn't read {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy . That's cool .,Marketing
4,It's very fashion .,User Interface
4,I didn't read any,Industrial Designer
4,Twelve and you've got twelve .,Marketing
4,b Yeah . Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
4,Mm .,User Interface
4,I I know .,Industrial Designer
4,"Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .",Marketing
4,Mm .,Industrial Designer
4,That should be cool .,Marketing
4,"Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,"If it's possible ,",Marketing
4,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
4,I don't think it's very expensive actually .,Project Manager
4,I don't know .,Industrial Designer
4,I dunno . I didn't read it .,Marketing
4,Mm .,User Interface
4,Why should it ?,Project Manager
4,"Yeah , I think it's {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,Uh if i if i,Marketing
4,You only have a microphone in it .,Project Manager
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,I didn't have information about that .,Marketing
4,"But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
4,"Nah , maybe {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,"Ah that's a problem , but {disfmarker}",Marketing
4,And and uh w Yeah ?,Industrial Designer
4,Uh only in English . Only in English I think .,Marketing
4,What {disfmarker} But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh {disfmarker} Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever,User Interface
4,"Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
4,uh one to have in channel one ?,User Interface
4,"No , that {disfmarker} Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do {vocalsound} do we do it ?",Marketing
4,"Yeah ,",User Interface
4,It's more if we if we do it .,Marketing
4,"I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .",User Interface
4,And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing,Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,Marketing
4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .,Project Manager
4,Is {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"It {disfmarker} We have short time to to put it on the market ,",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
4,so that {disfmarker} We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .,Project Manager
4,Mm {disfmarker} Yeah well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
4,Okay .,Marketing
4,"Yeah , I think so . {gap}",Industrial Designer
4,"We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . {gap}",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , and uh and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing
4,It's {disfmarker},User Interface
4,In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .,Marketing
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .,User Interface
4,And and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,Yeah . I think so .,Project Manager
4,"Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .",Marketing
4,"the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing
4,"Yeah . Well yeah ,",User Interface
4,it's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing
4,"that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one ,",User Interface
4,"But {disfmarker} Hmm yeah , T_V_ one .",Industrial Designer
4,but {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .",Marketing
4,"Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .",User Interface
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,So,Project Manager
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
4,we have to make some decisions . So,Project Manager
4,"Okay , no speech recognition .",Marketing
4,"you can see on the uh {disfmarker} So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface
4,"If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?",Project Manager
4,"Yeah , that's good .",Industrial Designer
4,"Okay , we just take that one .",Project Manager
4,Yep .,User Interface
4,"And what else , we have {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,Also the one in the dark . So uh {disfmarker} It lights up when it's dark ?,User Interface
4,"Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .",Project Manager
4,I didn't {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"If you push something , it it all lights up .",Project Manager
4,Okay .,User Interface
4,"Yeah . Yeah yeah ,",Marketing
4,"Yeah , but um {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,it it mustn't work all the time .,Marketing
4,"Yes , that's what I mean .",User Interface
4,It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .,Marketing
4,Or you can switch it on or something .,Project Manager
4,So if you {disfmarker},Marketing
4,Or maybe when you {disfmarker},User Interface
4,"No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .",Marketing
4,yeah . It lights up all .,User Interface
4,"Yeah , that's right . You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .",Project Manager
4,"Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .",User Interface
4,"And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , {gap} if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .",Project Manager
4,"Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .",User Interface
4,"Mm , maybe it's a good idea .",Industrial Designer
4,"Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .",User Interface
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,Like uh phones .,User Interface
4,Oh yeah .,Marketing
4,"Different colours . Okay ,",Project Manager
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
4,so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ?,Project Manager
4,"A see-through . Mm , that's cool .",Marketing
4,Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .,User Interface
4,"Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,",Project Manager
4,It's the standard {disfmarker},User Interface
4,and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .,Project Manager
4,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,",User Interface
4,But you have {disfmarker} You had a lot of different buttons .,Marketing
4,we but we don't {disfmarker} We don't really have any complicated buttons .,User Interface
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , maybe you have you have to {disfmarker} Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .",Project Manager
4,"Yeah okay , but {disfmarker} Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little {disfmarker}",User Interface
4,O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .,Project Manager
4,"No , I don't need don't need {disfmarker} Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .",User Interface
4,"Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .",Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
4,I use teletext as well .,User Interface
4,So uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
4,"No , I use te teletext every day , I think .",Marketing
4,Hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer
4,"Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .",Project Manager
4,"Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,",User Interface
4,Mm .,Marketing
4,I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .,User Interface
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,'Cause {gap} simple buttons .,User Interface
4,Okay .,Project Manager
4,"If you put one above it , it's clear .",User Interface
4,Okay . So that's it for toda for {disfmarker} We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
4,{vocalsound},Marketing
4,How long is lunch break ?,User Interface
4,"So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
4,Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine .,Marketing
4,Yeah .,Project Manager
4,Yo .,Marketing
4,"So , we're finished for t for this time . We're going to have some lunch .",Project Manager

5,Okay .,Project Manager
5,Unless uh things have suddenly change again .,Marketing
5,Is it much changes ?,Project Manager
5,"Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , {vocalsound} like uh last time .",Marketing
5,Uh I didn't {disfmarker} No no . I do hot have {disfmarker} Only the same information . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing
5,"Hello , Sebastian .",Project Manager
5,Hello hello Mister P_M_ .,Industrial Designer
5,"I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,"{vocalsound} Well , that's where the thinking goes on . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
5,"Oh , it's that Roo again , always late .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound} Bongiorno .,User Interface
5,Bongiorno .,Project Manager
5,I think you should punish him .,Industrial Designer
5,Hmm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5,You're the P_M_ . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound} Punish . {vocalsound},User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,I see some interesting {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,okay .,Project Manager
5,You wish . {vocalsound},User Interface
5,"Possibilities , yeah ? {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
5,"{vocalsound} People , welcome back .",Project Manager
5,Welcome . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
5,The third meeting . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5,Oop .,Marketing
5,"Um I have some points I would like to {disfmarker} uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um {vocalsound} first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,"so I could {disfmarker} uh can uh um use that in the in the report . {vocalsound} Um the second thing , um {vocalsound} I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},User Interface
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,"Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think .",Project Manager
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,Um {vocalsound} the agenda for now {disfmarker} uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?,Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,No .,User Interface
5,Not at all .,Industrial Designer
5,Okay . Um,Project Manager
5,No .,Marketing
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um {vocalsound} I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .",Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,"Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .",Project Manager
5,'Kay . Hmm ?,Marketing
5,Alright .,User Interface
5,Oh .,Marketing
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,{gap} .,Marketing
5,"Just press the okay button , it works .",Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} Okay .",Marketing
5,Um yeah .,Project Manager
5,Yeah . Yeah . My method ? {vocalsound},Marketing
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
5,{vocalsound} How surprising . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"Well , findings . Uh {disfmarker} Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,",Marketing
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
5,and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .,Marketing
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes {gap} uh m material . But we {disfmarker} since we are concentrating on uh the younger group {disfmarker},Marketing
5,Uh w wait a sec wait a se,Project Manager
5,Oh wait uh wait up .,Industrial Designer
5,uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes,Project Manager
5,'Kay .,Marketing
5,Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah {gap} okay . The feel of {gap} to be spongy {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?,Industrial Designer
5,"Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .",Marketing
5,Not something dull .,Industrial Designer
5,"But they like dark colours ,",User Interface
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,you said in the p,User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .",Marketing
5,Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .,User Interface
5,But {disfmarker},Marketing
5,I had {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface
5,But can you can you go back to that slide ? The {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer
5,Which one ?,Marketing
5,"just one slide back ,",Industrial Designer
5,This ?,Marketing
5,"no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .",Industrial Designer
5,Yes .,Marketing
5,"Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5,"{vocalsound} Uh well , it might .",Marketing
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But {disfmarker} Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .,Marketing
5,"Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it {disfmarker} maybe it rubber or or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,"Yeah , exactly .",Marketing
5,yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
5,"Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,",Marketing
5,Or we could make {disfmarker} oh .,User Interface
5,"but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So {disfmarker}",Marketing
5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,"Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .",Marketing
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .,Marketing
5,"Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager
5,It's quite interesting . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .",Project Manager
5,"Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh {vocalsound} telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .",User Interface
5,Yes . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
5,It's the it's the rubber uh cover .,User Interface
5,"Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .",Project Manager
5,And it's uh colourful .,User Interface
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"It looks likes a banana . {vocalsound} We have the fruit , we have the colours . {vocalsound} We have the simple design .",User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,Do you know the phone ?,Project Manager
5,"I don't know the phone ,",Industrial Designer
5,"It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,",Project Manager
5,but I can imagine it .,Industrial Designer
5,"I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,",Project Manager
5,Um thirty five .,User Interface
5,"Oh , that one , yes .",Industrial Designer
5,the very {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,And the b the light blue and {vocalsound} it's also in yellow .,User Interface
5,"Now I kn uh {disfmarker} oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .",Industrial Designer
5,"You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th",Project Manager
5,"I've seen it ,",Marketing
5,Okay . Okay . Um uh,Project Manager
5,but {disfmarker},Marketing
5,okay . Do you have {gap} {disfmarker} uh thit {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,'Kay . Uh that's about it .,Marketing
5,"Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the {disfmarker} our target group .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,Yes .,Marketing
5,And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .,Project Manager
5,Uh soft material .,Marketing
5,Okay .,Project Manager
5,"So {disfmarker} So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?",Industrial Designer
5,Uh the fancy look and feel .,Marketing
5,Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .,Industrial Designer
5,Yes . Apparently .,Marketing
5,"Okay , Roo ,",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,could you do your presentation ?,Project Manager
5,"Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,"Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .",Project Manager
5,"{vocalsound} Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .",User Interface
5,Shape .,Project Manager
5,So I suggest {disfmarker} I couldn't uh {disfmarker} I had a small uh mock-up uh {vocalsound} sign on the {vocalsound} on {gap} paper .,User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound} But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple {vocalsound} f uh a shape on uh {disfmarker} in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .,User Interface
5,"Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,Yeah .,Marketing
5,"And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .",Project Manager
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,"Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,",Project Manager
5,Slippery .,Industrial Designer
5,s because um {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .",User Interface
5,You have to grab it .,Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah . Yeah , exactly .",Project Manager
5,So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .,User Interface
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,",Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .,Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , {vocalsound}",Project Manager
5,So m Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,okay .,Project Manager
5,But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .,Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , good .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,Great . {vocalsound},User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .",User Interface
5,"Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,yeah .,Project Manager
5,"So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .",User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,"Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,",Industrial Designer
5,yeah .,Project Manager
5,"because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .",Industrial Designer
5,Okay .,Project Manager
5,"Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . Right .,User Interface
5,"But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . {vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .",Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound},User Interface
5,"Well , it would be very new to the market ,",Project Manager
5,I d,Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
5,"It would be very new ,",Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,"but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},User Interface
5,"Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well ,",Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,"this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're {disfmarker} you you have to um make some kind of energy {disfmarker} kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .",Industrial Designer
5,Like the watch .,User Interface
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,"{vocalsound} It have {disfmarker} it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .",Industrial Designer
5,"I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .",Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .,Industrial Designer
5,"I mean solar is {disfmarker} of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .",Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm . Indeed .,Industrial Designer
5,Um hand dynamo {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,"Well , maybe m",Project Manager
5,"if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .",User Interface
5,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,You you walk,User Interface
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,and uh {disfmarker} but uh you {disfmarker} you're sitting on a couch .,User Interface
5,"But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . And wha,Project Manager
5,"well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .",Industrial Designer
5,Okay .,Project Manager
5,"So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .",Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .",Project Manager
5,"Uh yes , it does .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,I'll come to that later .,Industrial Designer
5,Okay .,Project Manager
5,"And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . {vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um {vocalsound} uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
5,"uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5,"Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .",User Interface
5,{vocalsound} Yes . That is possible too . Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,{gap} {disfmarker} But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels {disfmarker} I had some {disfmarker} I had some information about it too .,User Interface
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5,I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .,User Interface
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .,User Interface
5,"Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .",Industrial Designer
5,"This will be the remote , right ?",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?,Project Manager
5,"Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,",User Interface
5,Uh it's do it's done before .,Industrial Designer
5,Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,but {disfmarker},User Interface
5,"Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .",Industrial Designer
5,"But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,Volume ?,Project Manager
5,"Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .",Industrial Designer
5,"A volume , okay .",User Interface
5,There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .,Industrial Designer
5,"Well , what about mute ?",Project Manager
5,About mute .,Industrial Designer
5,Thi i i m I guess uh th,Project Manager
5,"Well , yes .",Industrial Designer
5,this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .",Industrial Designer
5,And click it to muten the device .,Project Manager
5,"Well , okay . It's quite goods .",Industrial Designer
5,And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .,Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .,Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,"Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .",Project Manager
5,"Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,",Marketing
5,Wheel .,User Interface
5,it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .,Marketing
5,Okay .,Project Manager
5,"Hmm . {vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .",Industrial Designer
5,"Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .",Project Manager
5,So maybe it's not no {gap} .,Industrial Designer
5,"Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .",Project Manager
5,"Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .",Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .",Project Manager
5,It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"For you too , yeah .",Project Manager
5,"Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .",User Interface
5,"Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .",Industrial Designer
5,So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .,User Interface
5,"Yes . {gap} yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .",Industrial Designer
5,Okay . Sebastian . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation . {vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .",Industrial Designer
5,"{vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .",User Interface
5,Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,"Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function",User Interface
5,okay .,Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5,"and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,",User Interface
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,"and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5,It performs the action . Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .",User Interface
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .",User Interface
5,"{vocalsound} Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .",Industrial Designer
5,Okay . Uh well {disfmarker} uh,Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,d did we already decide on the display ? To {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .",Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah . Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display .",User Interface
5,No .,Project Manager
5,"Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,I I don't think either .,Industrial Designer
5,"'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,",User Interface
5,No . I don't think you need it .,Industrial Designer
5,On screen display . Yeah .,Project Manager
5,yeah .,User Interface
5,Okay,Project Manager
5,"Okay . Okay , well",Industrial Designer
5,th,Project Manager
5,"my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .",Industrial Designer
5,Okay . Good .,Project Manager
5,So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,Kineti okay .,Project Manager
5,"The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .",Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,",Project Manager
5,"Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,",Industrial Designer
5,too {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,uh well .,Industrial Designer
5,yeah .,Project Manager
5,"It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .",Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .",Project Manager
5,But {disfmarker} Yes . And I think it's more robust .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
5,It's more uh Uh it's more functional .,Industrial Designer
5,But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
5,"No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said .",Project Manager
5,The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5,"He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .",Project Manager
5,"Okay . Oh ,",User Interface
5,So um {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,sorry . Yeah .,User Interface
5,"So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,and we should uh use wood or something like that .,Industrial Designer
5,"No ,",Project Manager
5,And I would think {disfmarker},User Interface
5,And,Marketing
5,r,Project Manager
5,"yeah ,",Marketing
5,rubber with colours .,Project Manager
5,"the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood .",Marketing
5,"Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .",Industrial Designer
5,No the {disfmarker},Marketing
5,Colourful and {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .",Marketing
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"Okay , spongy materials .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . {vocalsound},Marketing
5,"Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .",Industrial Designer
5,And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?,User Interface
5,"So {disfmarker} Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , but we also {disfmarker} uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,"Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5,"oh ,",User Interface
5,"But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,",Project Manager
5,evalu,User Interface
5,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"{gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .",Industrial Designer
5,I it's too dull . Yeah .,Project Manager
5,I don't think c our customers will like it .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Marketing
5,"And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
5,So I think this is the best of two worlds .,Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour",Project Manager
5,Yes . It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,It's very unlogical .,Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .,User Interface
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,Well the there has to be some pointing at . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,It depends also on your on your {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just {vocalsound} to the other wall .",User Interface
5,"Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably {disfmarker} you're probably right .",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,"But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um {disfmarker} yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .",Project Manager
5,"All lights get absorbed , yeah . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
5,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,So {vocalsound} it has an {disfmarker} it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .,Industrial Designer
5,And the regular chip .,User Interface
5,I think uh it gives us the advantage of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .,User Interface
5,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound} I like the scroll wheels uh idea .,Project Manager
5,And uh skip {disfmarker} and skip the L_C_D_ part .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,I don't think it it's any uh value added thing .,Industrial Designer
5,No . Think so too .,User Interface
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,"Well , it looks {disfmarker} uh yeah , well um",Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,"according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,",Project Manager
5,Technology .,Industrial Designer
5,and I mean L_C_D_ is {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,Yes . It's not very flashy and new .,Industrial Designer
5,"well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard",Project Manager
5,Standard ?,Marketing
5,"than than {disfmarker} Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem .",Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5,"Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,",Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5,because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .,Project Manager
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,"But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .",User Interface
5,Mm yeah .,Project Manager
5,Uh I think our customers will go insane .,Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound} It's it's too much .,Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,"Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M",Marketing
5,"No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ? {gap} Roo , do you have any other {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,Um no . Nothing more .,User Interface
5,Nothing more . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing
5,Okay . Uh the n the next phase will be um the um {disfmarker} not the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,Sebas,Project Manager
5,what is the next phase {gap} f Flores ?,Industrial Designer
5,"{vocalsound} Well , we we {vocalsound} need to describe uh decisions now .",Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,So um,Project Manager
5,So i,Industrial Designer
5,"on the energy , well , we decided .",Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,Chip .,Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve .,Project Manager
5,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer
5,User interface um,Project Manager
5,"Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay .",User Interface
5,"Yes , they can work .",Industrial Designer
5,"Sorry , yeah .",User Interface
5,They cannot work with double-curved .,Industrial Designer
5,"Oh , sorry . Yeah .",User Interface
5,That's that's problem . I'll check it for you .,Industrial Designer
5,"Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,"{vocalsound} Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .",Project Manager
5,Yes . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5,"And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,{vocalsound},User Interface
5,Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .,Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound} The project drawing is for the next {disfmarker},User Interface
5,So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,"Yeah , it's it's uh {disfmarker} when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .",Project Manager
5,"Yeah , right .",User Interface
5,Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down .,Project Manager
5,I'll do .,Industrial Designer
5,Great . Um {disfmarker} Uh you you need to help me . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,Okay . W start with the casing .,Industrial Designer
5,"The casing is curved , single-curved .",Project Manager
5,Single-curved .,User Interface
5,"Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ?",Industrial Designer
5,Traditional batteries uh and solar .,Project Manager
5,But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ?,User Interface
5,"No ,",Project Manager
5,'Cause if we have to choose {disfmarker},User Interface
5,they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,yeah ?,User Interface
5,I I think they can . Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,Okay .,User Interface
5,"Well , uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5,Every device {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,What if not ?,User Interface
5,It it should be . There should be really no problem .,Industrial Designer
5,Okay .,User Interface
5,They can be supplementary . That's no problem .,Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah . Okay , um",Project Manager
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,th,Project Manager
5,So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .,Industrial Designer
5,"Battery and solar , yeah .",Project Manager
5,Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?,Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah , with colourful rubber .",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,"Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .",Project Manager
5,"Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . {gap} uh black and yellow .",Industrial Designer
5,Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .,Project Manager
5,Grey and yellow .,User Interface
5,"Grey yellow , okay .",Industrial Designer
5,"Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .",User Interface
5,"Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,",Project Manager
5,Hmm .,Marketing
5,but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .,Project Manager
5,"Oh , I think it's uh {disfmarker} it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?",Industrial Designer
5,"Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .",Project Manager
5,I believe the {disfmarker} But you have already um {disfmarker} you must have a red uh on and off button . And um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface
5,"Well , it it doesn't have to be red . Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image",Project Manager
5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
5,"or or {disfmarker} I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .",Project Manager
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,Or black and yellow .,Marketing
5,"Black and yellow , yeah .",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",Industrial Designer
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,"Well , there is . {vocalsound} Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,",User Interface

5,but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .,Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .",Project Manager
5,So {disfmarker} So I'm afraid it's not possible .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,A scroll-wheel .,User Interface
5,"The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .",Project Manager
5,"Voice recognition , of course .",User Interface
5,"Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"And th the {disfmarker} they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .",Industrial Designer
5,Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5,{vocalsound},Marketing
5,What what did you say ?,User Interface
5,"Well uh you can use {disfmarker} well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .",Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,So it has th the spongy uh feel also .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,"Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber .",User Interface
5,"{vocalsound} I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i",Project Manager
5,"Yeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .",User Interface
5,{gap} .,Project Manager
5,"What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .",User Interface
5,Uh is that {disfmarker} uh does our our supplier say so ?,Project Manager
5,"It is not uh something uh {disfmarker} it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,Uh didn't {disfmarker} did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?,Marketing
5,"No , but but uh it {disfmarker}",User Interface
5,'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .,Marketing
5,Yeah . You could place a {disfmarker} um uh this this would be the button .,Project Manager
5,There {disfmarker} the icons .,Marketing
5,"The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place the indica th th the signals the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,"Yeah , b yeah .",User Interface
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah , that's possible ,",User Interface
5,That's okay .,Industrial Designer
5,So you don't touch the icons that much .,Marketing
5,"but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .",User Interface
5,"No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or {disfmarker} But it's into the rubber .",Project Manager
5,"Yeah . Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .",User Interface
5,"Yeah , but this is on the pla",Project Manager
5,You have to draw the {disfmarker},User Interface
5,"Yes , the signs .",Industrial Designer
5,"yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .",Project Manager
5,"Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh {disfmarker} You just move the problem .",User Interface
5,What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?,Project Manager
5,"Uh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .",Industrial Designer
5,"Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel .",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5,"But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber .",Project Manager
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,"Well , I'm I'm not so sure ,",Industrial Designer
5,Y uh can you separate these uh these {disfmarker},User Interface
5,"I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .",Industrial Designer
5,"{vocalsound} I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?",Project Manager
5,{vocalsound} I think both .,Industrial Designer
5,"I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .",Project Manager
5,I do . {vocalsound},User Interface
5,I do .,Industrial Designer
5,Or the s uh the sideways .,User Interface
5,I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,Or the the back . Or the back .,User Interface
5,"Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the {disfmarker} these buttons ?",Project Manager
5,"I think {disfmarker} Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or {disfmarker} i you play with it .",User Interface
5,"Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you ,",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,"um because you have to make its prototype , and um {disfmarker} yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,Yeah .,User Interface
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,"so I'm going to leave it {disfmarker} the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?",Project Manager
5,Um not quite . Um what about uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ?,Industrial Designer
5,Regular .,User Interface
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,And {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,Use with {gap} .,User Interface
5,"Well {disfmarker} no , I think that's about it . Yes .",Industrial Designer
5,Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really {disfmarker},Project Manager
5,The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all .,Industrial Designer
5,"Okay , well .",Project Manager
5,And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ .,Industrial Designer
5,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5,"Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished . Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,{gap} . For the finishing touch .,User Interface
5,"Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write {disfmarker} wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?",Project Manager
5,Okay . Okay .,Industrial Designer
5,Uh yeah .,User Interface
5,Yeah .,Project Manager
5,But um Sebastian has everything .,User Interface
5,"I know , but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5,I'll put it online .,Industrial Designer
5,Great . {vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager

6,{vocalsound} Oh God .,Marketing
6,"Are we done ? Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place .",Project Manager
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6,"Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?",Project Manager
6,"Uh , no that's okay ,",Marketing
6,"Okay , um {vocalsound}",Project Manager
6,sorry .,Marketing
6,"I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .",Project Manager
6,Sorry .,User Interface
6,"Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um {disfmarker} try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of {disfmarker} oh oh you can see it , okay {vocalsound} . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .",Project Manager
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6,"Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ?",Project Manager
6,"Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information ,",Marketing
6,"No that's fine , that's fine . {gap}",Project Manager
6,is that okay ?,Marketing
6,"Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6,Unplug me .,Project Manager
6,"Thanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ?",Industrial Designer
6,"Um , F_N_ function F_ eight .",Project Manager
6,"Oh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6,Yep .,User Interface
6,"Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .",Industrial Designer
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6,"'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6,"Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .",Industrial Designer
6,"Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,",Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
6,Yeah sure .,Industrial Designer
6,is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?,Marketing
6,"Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,",Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .,Industrial Designer
6,"Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?",Marketing
6,Yeah the the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,Okay .,User Interface
6,They are .,Project Manager
6,well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption,Industrial Designer
6,Oh I see .,Marketing
6,and how much you need to send the data across .,Industrial Designer
6,Okay .,Marketing
6,"Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .",Industrial Designer
6,{gap},User Interface
6,"It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,",Industrial Designer
6,Mm . Mm .,Marketing
6,I {disfmarker} th that was just sort of a general point there .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,{vocalsound} And that's uh {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .",Marketing
6,"Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,",Industrial Designer
6,"Okay , thank you very much .",Project Manager
6,so if you wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,"Um , would you like to continue on from that ?",Project Manager
6,Yep .,User Interface
6,Ooh .,Industrial Designer
6,'Kay . It can be {disfmarker},User Interface
6,"Or , maybe move the laptop over .",Project Manager
6,"okay , that's okay with me . {gap} further . {gap}",User Interface
6,{gap},Project Manager
6,"Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?",User Interface
6,F_ function .,Project Manager
6,Function F_ eight yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Okay . Mm why's it in the right ?,User Interface
6,"No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .",Marketing
6,"Yeah , it's connecting {gap} .",User Interface
6,"No , no yeah it's just {gap} .",Industrial Designer
6,Meter adjusting .,Marketing
6,{gap} okay .,User Interface
6,"Oh , there {gap} .",Project Manager
6,"Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that .",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .,User Interface
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,"Uh any comments like , if you want ?",User Interface
6,"'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,",Project Manager
6,Okay .,User Interface
6,"okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,Yeah sure .,Industrial Designer
6,'Kay .,Marketing
6,"Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay .",Project Manager
6,I think you'll have to {disfmarker},User Interface
6,Have I got to keep this here ?,Marketing
6,You can't {disfmarker},User Interface
6,Does it matter ?,Marketing
6,It'll have to {disfmarker} this can't be pulled .,User Interface
6,I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ?,Marketing
6,We just do the best we can .,Project Manager
6,"Uh , whoops .",Marketing
6,You'll have to push it a bit more .,User Interface
6,"Will it manage ? Bit more ,",Marketing
6,Yep .,User Interface
6,oh dear . {vocalsound},Marketing
6,Yeah this is more than enough . Okay .,User Interface
6,"There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6,Oh . {vocalsound},Marketing
6,There we go .,Industrial Designer
6,Is that okay ?,Marketing
6,Yeah I think you can pull it out now .,User Interface
6,"Thank you ,",Marketing
6,{gap},User Interface
6,just pull it closer a little bit .,Marketing
6,Uh you should be able to {gap} and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,"Yeah , you might .",Project Manager
6,"yeah , there you go .",Industrial Designer
6,"Get it right over , okay , thank you .",Marketing
6,Ah . Look at that .,Project Manager
6,"Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,",Marketing
6,Yeah .,User Interface
6,"so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,",Marketing
6,'Kay .,User Interface
6,"but I think I'll just keep it simple ,",Marketing
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6,"if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,",Marketing
6,{gap} That's fine .,User Interface
6,Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager
6,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6,is that okay ?,Marketing
6,"Right , um",Project Manager
6,Huh .,Industrial Designer
6,"we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,",Project Manager
6,Okay .,User Interface
6,"um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um {vocalsound} our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it limits the cost for us ,",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .,Project Manager
6,"Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?",Marketing
6,"It says for T_V_ only , so {vocalsound} looks like it's just {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,Just channel-hopping .,Marketing
6,"yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but {vocalsound} I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .",Project Manager
6,Would that imply video use ?,Marketing
6,T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g,Industrial Designer
6,I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?,Project Manager
6,Yeah . If yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,"Mm-hmm , yes .",Marketing
6,"and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .",Industrial Designer
6,Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming .,Project Manager
6,{vocalsound} Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?,User Interface
6,Yes .,Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,",Marketing
6,Ten perc,User Interface
6,Mm .,Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound},Marketing
6,Okay .,User Interface
6,Hmm .,Project Manager
6,Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing,Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,Pens,User Interface
6,and they're not that great anyway .,Industrial Designer
6,"In fact I've just called up that table there ,",Marketing
6,"Alright , okay .",Industrial Designer
6,"we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?",Marketing
6,"Alright , okay .",Industrial Designer
6,"So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there ,",Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .",Marketing
6,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
6,Yeah but um on on that again I just thought {disfmarker} 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is,Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,bu,Project Manager
6,Oh yeah .,Marketing
6,so I thought that could be quite a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,Right .,Marketing
6,"We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing",Project Manager
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,"um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,",Project Manager
6,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps",Project Manager
6,Okay .,User Interface
6,"and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Yes . That's a super idea .,Marketing
6,but that's {disfmarker} that sounds a lot cheaper to me .,Project Manager
6,Hmm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Yeah .,Marketing
6,"Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .",Project Manager
6,"Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Project Manager
6,"and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,",Marketing
6,Mm .,Project Manager
6,"you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs {gap} ?",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Project Manager
6,Sure .,User Interface
6,Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs,Industrial Designer
6,Alright .,User Interface
6,I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .,Industrial Designer
6,Right .,User Interface
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
6,The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .,User Interface
6,Just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,Yeah .,Marketing
6,"yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,So {disfmarker},User Interface
6,"What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons ,",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,User Interface
6,"um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers",Project Manager
6,"'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer
6,"yeah ? Um so you {disfmarker} it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,{gap},User Interface
6,"No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to {disfmarker} you don't actually have to press them you just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6,"You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .",Project Manager
6,{gap},User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Um , think that might appeal {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,",Project Manager
6,Mm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,trendy kind of a thing .,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def,Marketing
6,"Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,"and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,"Mm-hmm , mm .",Marketing
6,"Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big",Industrial Designer
6,Were too big .,Project Manager
6,because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands,Industrial Designer
6,Mm .,Project Manager
6,so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .,Industrial Designer
6,"Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .",User Interface
6,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .",User Interface
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control,User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .",User Interface
6,I think we have to design one product,Project Manager
6,Hmm . Huh .,Industrial Designer
6,and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .",Marketing
6,"It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"I'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .,Marketing
6,I {disfmarker} yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause {disfmarker} without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel,Industrial Designer
6,"Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .",Marketing
6,and it becomes {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,"Or a speech recognition ,",Project Manager
6,"yeah . Yeah , speech recognition ,",Industrial Designer
6,Yeah .,Marketing
6,"which is extremely expensive ,",Project Manager
6,but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .,Project Manager
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .",Marketing
6,We could focus on the biggest market .,User Interface
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?,User Interface
6,Ge uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,"And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .",Marketing
6,"We are {disfmarker} we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable ,",Project Manager
6,{vocalsound},Marketing
6,they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume {disfmarker} associate that with the older generations .,Project Manager
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,"Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,Mm-hmm {vocalsound} .,Marketing
6,"but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .",Project Manager
6,"Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate",Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
6,"and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first {disfmarker} it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .",Marketing
6,"Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ ,",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,",Project Manager
6,Video plus .,Industrial Designer
6,"yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,Yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um",Project Manager
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"because you've got your general record anyway so if you {disfmarker} there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in",Project Manager
6,Just whack in the number .,Industrial Designer
6,"and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,",Project Manager
6,And you w {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6,it's just a number .,Project Manager
6,"yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,",Industrial Designer
6,No .,Project Manager
6,"you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,",Industrial Designer
6,You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .,Project Manager
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful {vocalsound} .",Marketing
6,It is,Project Manager
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6,"after um {disfmarker} if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards",Project Manager
6,It's not {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth,Project Manager
6,"Ah , hmm .",Marketing
6,"so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,",Project Manager
6,Right .,Marketing
6,um and it has been around for quite a long time .,Project Manager
6,It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .,Industrial Designer
6,No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that {disfmarker},Project Manager
6,Superb . Mm .,Marketing
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
6,Yes .,Marketing
6,Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it {disfmarker} you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on,Industrial Designer
6,Mm .,Project Manager
6,Right .,Marketing
6,and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .,Industrial Designer
6,"Excellent , mm-hmm .",Marketing
6,So that {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,But just to have that function would be would be really good .,Industrial Designer
6,Right .,Marketing
6,Okay so {disfmarker},Project Manager
6,"Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , {gap} to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .",Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
6,"Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?",Marketing
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6,But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um {disfmarker} the companies who uh who you deal with have actually {disfmarker} they've they've got an obligation to to help you out,Industrial Designer
6,Mm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,and also {disfmarker} I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,Right .,Marketing
6,"The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?",Project Manager
6,Alright . {vocalsound} Yes,Marketing
6,{vocalsound},User Interface
6,"{vocalsound} If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel ,",Marketing
6,{gap},Industrial Designer
6,"but I mean for {disfmarker} if there were any more {disfmarker} or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video ,",Marketing
6,I think so .,Project Manager
6,"Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6,"we're not gonna put any {disfmarker} {vocalsound} okay , just a thought .",Marketing
6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
6,I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .,Industrial Designer
6,"Instruction manuals . But I mean they're {disfmarker} there's customer service ,",Project Manager
6,Okay .,Marketing
6,there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to,Project Manager
6,"Yeah . Department , yeah .",Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm . Sure .,Marketing
6,"and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um .",Project Manager
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,Right .,User Interface
6,Yeah .,Marketing
6,"I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to {disfmarker} for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .,User Interface
6,And they're {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,Not for such simple functions,Marketing
6,"yeah , they should be f yeah .",Industrial Designer
6,"because we're focusing on that ,",Marketing
6,Mm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible,Project Manager
6,yes okay .,Marketing
6,Simple .,User Interface
6,because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .",Marketing
6,"It does ,",Project Manager
6,It's the uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong,Project Manager
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about .",Project Manager
6,"Sure , okay .",Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"Um , what other functions ? We need {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about {disfmarker} c 'cause you've got the dilemma between {disfmarker} oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?",Project Manager
6,"Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6,"Well they la they they last quite a long time ,",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
6,"and if you had uh {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .",Project Manager
6,Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,"Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay .",Project Manager
6,Yeah on that as well so .,Industrial Designer
6,So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?,User Interface
6,S,Project Manager
6,Yeah,Industrial Designer
6,Yes .,Project Manager
6,some sort of docking station or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,Rechargeable with a docking station .,Project Manager
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,So the rechargeable which would be your field .,Project Manager
6,"Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,",Industrial Designer
6,Okay .,Project Manager
6,and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .,Industrial Designer
6,Right .,User Interface
6,"Yes ,",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,which it is cheaper in the long run as well .,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either ,",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how much you try and make it simple ,",Project Manager
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,um {disfmarker},Project Manager
6,"And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,",Marketing
6,They do .,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely {disfmarker} an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .",Marketing
6,Okay so we've got a flip-screen .,Project Manager
6,Okay .,User Interface
6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
6,"What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate .",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,",User Interface
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,"and you don't have to {disfmarker} you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .",User Interface
6,"Slightly curved , curved .",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Okay .,Project Manager
6,G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't,User Interface
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .,Project Manager
6,y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your {disfmarker},User Interface
6,Mm .,Marketing
6,"the way you h hold of {disfmarker} it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Okay .,Project Manager
6,I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .,User Interface
6,"Can you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .",Project Manager
6,Current .,User Interface
6,"I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,",Project Manager
6,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design ,",Project Manager
6,{gap},Marketing
6,while also making it quite different from anything else that's there .,Project Manager
6,"We could look in at that but {disfmarker} Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells ,",User Interface
6,I mean look at the mobile .,Marketing
6,"logo could become as {disfmarker} you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .",User Interface
6,Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different .,Project Manager
6,"I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that sounds a really attractive idea ,",Marketing
6,A sea shell ?,User Interface
6,"I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of {disfmarker} yeah and that opens out into your flip-top .",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea",Marketing
6,Yeah we could look in at that .,User Interface
6,"and plus you can get {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know even though we're using plastic , you can still {disfmarker} I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .",Marketing
6,"Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings .",Project Manager
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and {disfmarker},Project Manager
6,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Project Manager
6,and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't {disfmarker} not gonna lose it so much {vocalsound} either . It's easier to {disfmarker} bit nice to handle .,Marketing
6,Mm .,Project Manager
6,"Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are {disfmarker} whichever appeals the most like ,",User Interface
6,Okay .,Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
6,that could be the most common design .,User Interface
6,Okay .,Project Manager
6,Okay .,Marketing
6,"But we can like think of five , six designs .",User Interface
6,"Okay . Right , I think we have to round it up , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .,Marketing
6,Sure .,Project Manager
6,"So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video ,",Marketing
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
6,"our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .",Marketing
6,"That was um in cutting down the number {disfmarker} that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,"Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you {disfmarker} it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and {disfmarker} Or was {disfmarker} is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just {disfmarker} that was an add-on feature ?",Marketing
6,"{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .",Project Manager
6,"Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?",Marketing
6,"Um it could be it c It {disfmarker} yes ,",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,",Project Manager
6,Right .,Marketing
6,"you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .",Project Manager
6,"Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .",Marketing
6,Yeah .,Project Manager
6,Was there anything else there that we {disfmarker} in the new new project requirements ?,Marketing
6,{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
6,Yeah . {gap},User Interface
6,"We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .",Project Manager
6,Yeah .,User Interface
6,"Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at ,",Marketing
6,Yes . Yes .,Project Manager
6,what preference {disfmarker} so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .,Marketing
6,"And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .",Project Manager
6,"For detection , right .",User Interface
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6,"Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . I think {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6,"Yep ,",User Interface
6,"Yep ,",Project Manager
6,I think {disfmarker},User Interface
6,"and different from what's out there . Yep , I think that's us .",Project Manager
6,Okay .,Marketing
6,True .,User Interface
6,What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?,Marketing
6,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6,Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ?,Marketing
6,"I think you might get guidance , but um I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing ,",Project Manager
6,Okay .,Marketing
6,"u um , they're {disfmarker} everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .",Project Manager
6,Okay .,Marketing
6,Um .,Project Manager
6,Oops .,User Interface
6,"Whoops , questionnaire four .",Marketing
6,We should f,User Interface
6,"Yes , right . Okay .",Project Manager
6,I think it's time for us to get back to {disfmarker},User Interface
6,'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .,Marketing
6,"Right , okay . I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . Um and I'll be able to not answer them .",Project Manager
7,"Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um {vocalsound} .",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},User Interface
7,Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound} 'Scuse me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,Bless you .,Marketing
7,"Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , {vocalsound} under marketing we targeted our audience , and {disfmarker} Um , yeah . That was {vocalsound} generally {vocalsound} {disfmarker} how helpful that was .",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're {disfmarker} Right , um {disfmarker} So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what {disfmarker} where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ?",Project Manager
7,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,Okay .,Project Manager
7,Yes .,Industrial Designer
7,Yes .,User Interface
7,Would anybody like to go first ?,Project Manager
7,Sure .,Industrial Designer
7,Okay .,Project Manager
7,"So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .",Industrial Designer
7,And why not wood ?,Project Manager
7,"And ,",Industrial Designer
7,And why not wood ? {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"hmm ? {vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood . {vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design .",Industrial Designer
7,'S good .,Project Manager
7,"Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material",Marketing
7,Hmm .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,which is quite shocking .,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the {vocalsound} is the current trend",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion .",Marketing
7,Mm .,Project Manager
7,"The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,but that's just a personal opinion .,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},User Interface
7,I think,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"{vocalsound} Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .",Marketing
7,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
7,Thank you for your attention .,Marketing
7,So .,User Interface
7,"I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah .",Project Manager
7,"Oh , uh , there we go . {vocalsound} Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics,User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,and and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
7,"Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um {vocalsound} fabrics . {vocalsound}",Marketing
7,Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?",User Interface
7,Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .,Project Manager
7,'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel,User Interface
7,You need a screen for it ?,Project Manager
7,you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen .,User Interface
7,"You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
7,"But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?",User Interface
7,"We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,",Project Manager
7,Are we {disfmarker},User Interface
7,that was one of th I I was {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7,Okay .,User Interface
7,"sorry ,",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,I I meant to update you on that . Um .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} Alright . Okay .,User Interface
7,"But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said .",Marketing
7,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7,That correct ?,Marketing
7,So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right .,User Interface
7,Graphical interface ?,Marketing
7,Yeah like you're g,User Interface
7,Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though .,Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can {disfmarker} okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,So that {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} people seems to be {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface
7,"You've {disfmarker} Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um {vocalsound} I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because {disfmarker} So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if {disfmarker} or or {disfmarker} then again if you just {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .,User Interface
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7,You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or {disfmarker},User Interface
7,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing
7,But but imagine someone with s,Project Manager
7,"My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer
7,I oh yeah ?,User Interface
7,But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker},User Interface
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,They have to r wheel really fast .,Industrial Designer
7,but you can quickly s you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
7,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,",Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
7,at least on theirs .,Industrial Designer
7,"Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth",User Interface
7,Right .,Project Manager
7,"And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,",User Interface
7,"Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better ,",Project Manager
7,like {disfmarker},User Interface
7,"because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,"I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,It's more expensive according to the design people .,Industrial Designer
7,m yeah .,User Interface
7,Uh . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"Yeah , that's the only thing though .",User Interface
7,"You have to get a {disfmarker} an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .",Industrial Designer
7,"Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,Mm .,Project Manager
7,"{vocalsound} You can get to {disfmarker} you know , you can {disfmarker} Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can {disfmarker} it brings up like the menu on the T_V_",User Interface
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
7,Mm .,Project Manager
7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,"So the T_V_ is the screen , that {disfmarker} yeah",Project Manager
7,"yeah , yeah .",User Interface
7,So it would have all these different options of changing,Project Manager
7,Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .,User Interface
7,to {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Look it even has settings .,Marketing
7,Okay .,Project Manager
7,Hmm ?,User Interface
7,On the {disfmarker},Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} you can just take theirs and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing
7,"Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"but um {disfmarker} 'cause that just {disfmarker} it does seem like , it {disfmarker} that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but {disfmarker} I dunno , and then {disfmarker} so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface
7,"Um , right . What if {disfmarker} I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes ,",Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,"um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing ,",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .,User Interface
7,Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Yeah . Yeah definitely .,User Interface
7,okay .,Project Manager
7,"Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,I mean it it needs to be easy to {disfmarker},User Interface
7,Yeah but should be comfortable .,Marketing
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your {disfmarker},User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"I mean how do how do {disfmarker} I'm not really {disfmarker} Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,"Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So {disfmarker},User Interface
7,Yeah I use it like that .,Marketing
7,"W when we had the wheely remote control , we {disfmarker} it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .",Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,"But , were there buttons on there as well ?",Project Manager
7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .,Industrial Designer
7,Mm . Yeah .,Project Manager
7,So we just used the top part .,Industrial Designer
7,Mm yeah .,User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker} but I mean I think it could be pretty small .",User Interface
7,Uh .,Marketing
7,"Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,"What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you {disfmarker} so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .",Project Manager
7,But can't you just get {disfmarker},User Interface
7,"Do {disfmarker} do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7,K,User Interface
7,"Well you can have it on the settings ,",Marketing
7,"Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
7,no ?,Marketing
7,"Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen .",User Interface
7,Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7,is is {disfmarker} if w I {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,That keeps it,User Interface
7,"if we can do this , that'd probably be {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,really {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh you wouldn't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I just don't think you would even need it .,User Interface
7,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface
7,"So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this {disfmarker} how they actually programme these things , and if that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,Mean {disfmarker},User Interface
7,Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?,Industrial Designer
7,yeah . I mean it {disfmarker} would y would {disfmarker} that would be {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,I don't know .,Industrial Designer
7,"I mean you can do it ,",User Interface
7,They already do it .,Marketing
7,"I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .",Industrial Designer
7,you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote .,User Interface
7,I'm not sure .,Industrial Designer
7,"It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,Well they usually are .,Industrial Designer
7,which is a little {disfmarker},User Interface
7,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7,"My {disfmarker} I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .",User Interface
7,No .,Marketing
7,Huh .,Project Manager
7,But um {disfmarker},User Interface
7,I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"So , um {disfmarker} but I mean it's {disfmarker} I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .",User Interface
7,"Yeah , it {disfmarker} most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .",Industrial Designer
7,"Yeah . Yeah . Well so {disfmarker} So , do we need {disfmarker} I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about {disfmarker} But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .",User Interface
7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,That's what it does anyway .,User Interface
7,"But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you {disfmarker} like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,",Marketing
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
7,Yeah . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,and I never get it .,Marketing
7,yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Never ever .,Marketing
7,"So , but {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,So {disfmarker},Marketing
7,"oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?",User Interface
7,Well on the telly .,Marketing
7,Or on the T_V_ too .,Industrial Designer
7,"On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .",User Interface
7,"Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,",Project Manager
7,Mm .,Marketing
7,so that fits with the {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are {vocalsound} really hot right now , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,B Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Did you did you get that pc picture on {disfmarker} did they provide you with that picture on the web ?,Marketing
7,"Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,That's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? {vocalsound},Marketing
7,Oh god . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"{vocalsound} Oh , I was gonna say .",Industrial Designer
7,Oh .,User Interface
7,You said uh people want spongy .,Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"{vocalsound} Um , one of your {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,"one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's {gap} in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .",Industrial Designer
7,"Oh , okay , that would be cool .",User Interface
7,Ah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,Mm . {vocalsound},User Interface
7,"Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of {disfmarker} oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing .",User Interface
7,Yeah . I mean definitely the area round it .,Project Manager
7,But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda {disfmarker},User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,so you're like {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
7,Yeah I think it could work .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Or what if we integrated the {vocalsound} the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables,User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,"we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like",User Interface
7,{vocalsound} Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .,Industrial Designer
7,a vegetable . {vocalsound},User Interface
7,Well it could be like mobiles that just {disfmarker} you just put a cover .,Marketing
7,An orange . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface
7,"If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana ,",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"which frankly I'm not particularly fond of ,",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},User Interface
7,um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing .,Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,You know you had {disfmarker} there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .,Marketing
7,"You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .",Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"And it could {disfmarker} the colour can fit your sitting room ,",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have {disfmarker} well I don't know . Um .",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,So what if {disfmarker} what,Project Manager
7,So I think {disfmarker},User Interface
7,{disfmarker} this is {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,"yeah , colours .",User Interface
7,"I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .",Project Manager
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,Is that kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,I {disfmarker} 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables .,User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,I do I dunno . Um {disfmarker},User Interface
7,I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just {disfmarker} the feedback we've just got about the {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Maybe a ball .,Marketing
7,A ball ?,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"Know , a squashy ball .",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} A relaxing squashy ball . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That you can p,Marketing
7,"That's in the shape of a fruit , like a {disfmarker}",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"well I {disfmarker} see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit",Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,"and I'm thinking how do you change the hard {disfmarker} would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a {disfmarker}",Marketing
7,This is just {disfmarker} Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .,Project Manager
7,"Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Marketing
7,That {disfmarker} see I was thinking this s,Project Manager
7,Which is cheaper .,Marketing
7,sorry {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .,Marketing
7,I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .,Project Manager
7,Oh . Mm .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,And like this {disfmarker} you could have like you could have like cherries and {vocalsound} things around there .,Project Manager
7,Oh I like that shape .,User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,Um but {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,I was thinking sort of a single ball shape .,Industrial Designer
7,I was thinking if it was like this {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface
7,So you're holding a squishy ball,Industrial Designer
7,'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,and then it has a {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7,It's like it has to be s,User Interface
7,"It's almost like your thumb is farther up ,",Project Manager
7,yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface
7,so if if you could squish it lower then {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Yeah I guess so .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,"Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either {disfmarker} like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .",Marketing
7,"Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .",Project Manager
7,"What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can {disfmarker} so so maybe one you know {disfmarker} you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing {vocalsound}",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,"and you could get {disfmarker} you could have your choice , you know ?",User Interface
7,"Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover .",Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"But {disfmarker} well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that ,",Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,"and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that ,",Marketing
7,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface
7,Mm .,Project Manager
7,"and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is ,",Marketing
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Okay .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,and {disfmarker},Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Okay .,Project Manager
7,No .,Marketing
7,Oh .,User Interface
7,Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .,Marketing
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,"Hmm . Well that's not very neat , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,Um .,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,Yeah . I mean I think uh {disfmarker} and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely {disfmarker} So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .,User Interface
7,"If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your {disfmarker} to the way you hold it .",Marketing
7,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
7,Yeah you could squish it .,Industrial Designer
7,"If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you {disfmarker} it it just moulds to your hand .",Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?,User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,"I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .",Industrial Designer
7,Fruits and veg .,User Interface
7,We we don't know . {vocalsound},Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Yeah .,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,And the rest is the company {disfmarker} the company colour's silver ?,Marketing
7,"It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,We could promote the banana one .,User Interface
7,Okay .,Marketing
7,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} Like {disfmarker} mm .,User Interface
7,"I mean that's another question , where are we gonna {disfmarker} we we should have the logo somewhere on it .",Project Manager
7,Mm .,User Interface
7,"Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't {disfmarker}",Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .,Industrial Designer
7,Oh yeah .,User Interface
7,"Yeah , th and that would {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,Okay .,Marketing
7,Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .,Industrial Designer
7,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
7,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
7,"Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .",User Interface
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,But uh it {disfmarker},User Interface
7,Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .,Industrial Designer
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,No but it does it automatically .,Marketing
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},User Interface
7,{vocalsound} Does it automatically ?,Marketing
7,Yeah .,User Interface
7,I don't know .,Marketing
7,I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound} But if someone {disfmarker},Project Manager
7,Okay .,Marketing
7,components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark .,Project Manager
7,That was me .,Industrial Designer
7,Was that you ?,Project Manager
7,Yes .,Industrial Designer
7,"Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7,"Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,",Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .,Industrial Designer
7,"Oh , a dynamo is {disfmarker} ah , {vocalsound} it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .",Marketing
7,"Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself .",Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7,So I sort of picked battery .,Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},User Interface
7,It's quite sweet .,Marketing
7,We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .,Industrial Designer
7,I think batteries sound good .,Project Manager
7,It {vocalsound} it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .,Industrial Designer
7,What does everyone else think ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,{vocalsound} The dynamo would be interesting {vocalsound} .,User Interface
7,"No . But dynamo {disfmarker} the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it {vocalsound} creates energy on its own .",Marketing
7,What about Kryptonite ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
7,Oh .,User Interface
7,"Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .",Marketing
7,Yeah .,Project Manager
7,Don't know the cost .,Marketing
7,Didn't have enough data to actually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7,Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?,Marketing
7,"All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost .",Industrial Designer
7,Okay . Right .,Marketing
7,Hmm .,User Interface
7,Mm .,Marketing
7,Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .,Industrial Designer
7,What does chip on print mean ?,Project Manager
7,"Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,",Industrial Designer
7,{vocalsound},Marketing
7,Uh-huh .,Project Manager
7,"calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .",Industrial Designer
7,Okay .,Project Manager
7,"But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .",Industrial Designer
7,"Right . So , chip on print is just {disfmarker} means like that they're mass-produced .",Project Manager
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7,"Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about ,",Project Manager
7,Case is what we were discussing yeah .,Industrial Designer
7,yeah . Casing . Yeah . {gap} thinking of like syntactic case and thi,Project Manager
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,um {vocalsound} let's see . Is there anything else we need to,Project Manager
7,Hmm .,User Interface
7,"talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .",Project Manager
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7,"Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .",Project Manager
7,"Oh , thank you . {vocalsound}",Marketing
7,Mm .,Project Manager
7,Cool .,User Interface
7,See you soon . Does it matter that I end early ?,Project Manager
7,I {disfmarker} it's strange because {disfmarker},Marketing
7,How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said {disfmarker},Project Manager
8,Oh .,Project Manager
8,It's not saved yet .,User Interface
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer
8,So {disfmarker},User Interface
8,Okay .,Project Manager
8,Our beautiful drawing .,User Interface
8,So just f um {disfmarker} So this is our agenda . You're {disfmarker} F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .,Project Manager
8,Oops .,Marketing
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer
8,Uh I didn't {disfmarker} Oh yeah . So these are the {disfmarker},Project Manager
8,"Oh , okay . Yeah .",Industrial Designer
8,"So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .",Project Manager
8,Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .,User Interface
8,"Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay .",Project Manager
8,Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .,User Interface
8,"Okay , just {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8,"Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
8,"Yeah , and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .",Industrial Designer
8,Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .,Project Manager
8,"It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you {gap} other functions .",Industrial Designer
8,{vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .,User Interface
8,"Maybe that's better . Yeah , that's that's a very good point .",Project Manager
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
8,"Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside .",User Interface
8,Think that's better .,Industrial Designer
8,So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .,User Interface
8,Yeah . Okay . So this is okay ? {gap},Project Manager
8,"{gap} No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .",User Interface
8,"Okay , so that's {disfmarker} Uh I'll just have a look how much that is .",Project Manager
8,{vocalsound} The {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8,"But um {disfmarker} Okay , for the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8,Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .,User Interface
8,Okay .,Project Manager
8,"Yeah , I I think so . I don't know .",Industrial Designer
8,"No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8,Okay .,User Interface
8,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer
8,So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .,Project Manager
8,Good .,User Interface
8,So you can show your prototype if you want to .,Project Manager
8,Together ?,User Interface
8,"Yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Let's do it together .",Industrial Designer
8,I'll give comments .,User Interface
8,"Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . {vocalsound} Uh the material should be hard plastic . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .",Industrial Designer
8,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
8,"And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have {disfmarker} The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel .",Industrial Designer
8,"Okay , cool . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
8,"And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .",Industrial Designer
8,Okay .,Project Manager
8,"And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger .",Industrial Designer
8,Means {disfmarker},Marketing
8,So you hold it like this in your right hand and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8,Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?,Project Manager
8,{vocalsound},Marketing
8,Speech recognition .,User Interface
8,"Yeah , speech recognition . Just {disfmarker} Only one button to say it's on or off .",Project Manager
8,Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .,User Interface
8,Uh I dunno .,Industrial Designer
8,Um so I've {disfmarker},User Interface
8,"Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .",Industrial Designer
8,"Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .",User Interface
8,So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .,Project Manager
8,"Yeah , you can {gap} put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .",User Interface
8,"Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know .",Industrial Designer
8,Okay .,Project Manager
8,That's uh {disfmarker},User Interface
8,"Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .",Industrial Designer
8,Okay .,Marketing
8,"We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But {disfmarker} You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .",User Interface
8,"Yeah , you can put it separate .",Project Manager
8,You {disfmarker} Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So {disfmarker} But it's enough room .,User Interface
8,"Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
8,Uh well {disfmarker},User Interface
8,"You wrote this , so .",Industrial Designer
8,"Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . That was the the most important thing .",User Interface
8,{gap},Marketing
8,"So uh the best {gap} place , the best reach place {disfmarker} Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's {vocalsound} basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .",User Interface
8,"Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .",Industrial Designer
8,Yeah .,User Interface
8,Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine .,Marketing
8,"Okay yeah , they {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface
8,But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .,Marketing
8,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer
8,Yeah okay . That's that's below that then .,User Interface
8,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
8,It's uh twelve buttons .,User Interface
8,{gap} just so you get that .,Industrial Designer
8,"Okay , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's rather important . {vocalsound}",Marketing
8,"Yeah okay , just we just missed that .",User Interface
8,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
8,"But um I'll just uh {disfmarker} I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um {disfmarker} The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .",User Interface
8,Okay .,Project Manager
8,"So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh {vocalsound} in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .",User Interface
8,Okay .,Marketing
8,"And also in the num-pads , there's also colour {gap} light behind it .",User Interface
8,"And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?",Project Manager
8,So when you pre Yeah .,User Interface
8,How do you want to implement that ? Just on the {disfmarker} Maybe on the second level as well ?,Project Manager
8,We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little {disfmarker},User Interface
8,"Yeah , these are just basic functions , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
8,Ah .,Marketing
8,All the non-basic are in {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8,"Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .",Project Manager
8,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface
8,Okay . Um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8,"Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player .",Marketing
8,"Okay , maybe we use this button for the {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
8,"That function must be {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .",Marketing
8,"Yeah ,",User Interface
8,"Yeah , as well .",Project Manager
8,I um {disfmarker},User Interface
8,Just make make a {gap} {disfmarker},Project Manager
8,To your video device .,User Interface
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
8,Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . {vocalsound},Project Manager
8,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
8,{vocalsound} A second level ?,Industrial Designer
8,Yeah .,Project Manager
8,Like a a new blank one or {disfmarker} Or just here ?,Industrial Designer
8,"No no , just on {disfmarker} Down there .",Project Manager
8,Is i Ah okay .,User Interface
8,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
8,Okay . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
8,And h how does the second level come out ?,Marketing
8,Just uh if you s,Project Manager
8,Uh it slides uh along ?,Marketing
8,Um slides I think .,User Interface
8,"Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .",Project Manager
8,It's,User Interface
8,From from the uh beneath ?,Marketing
8,For the bottom .,Project Manager
8,"You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .",User Interface
8,"No , you gotta slide it .",Project Manager
8,If that breaks then you're screwed .,User Interface
8,"Yeah , it's right .",Project Manager
8,So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um {disfmarker},User Interface
8,So what do we need ?,Industrial Designer
8,Uh i the the speech functions buttons .,User Interface
8,"Yeah , just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
8,Menu ?,Marketing
8,Menu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh,User Interface
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager
8,"scroll in the , navigate the menu . Um {disfmarker}",User Interface
8,God damn it .,Industrial Designer
8,Scart ?,Marketing
8,{gap} I think we can even put a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels .,User Interface
8,"Uh yeah . And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . {vocalsound}",Marketing
8,"So you have one left for the {disfmarker} Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .",User Interface
8,So this is the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8,Yeah .,Marketing
8,"If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .",User Interface
8,{gap},Industrial Designer
8,{vocalsound} It's a f {vocalsound} basic uh {disfmarker},Marketing
8,Yeah .,Project Manager
8,Extern or something .,Industrial Designer
8,{gap},User Interface
8,You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ?,Project Manager
8,That was it .,User Interface
8,"So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .",Industrial Designer
8,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
8,Doesn't really matter . Just just uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
8,It doesn't really matter .,User Interface
8,I don't know the functions .,Industrial Designer
8,That's {disfmarker} Yeah well we don't have any uh {disfmarker},User Interface
8,Okay . What else ?,Industrial Designer
8,Hmm ?,User Interface
8,What else ?,Industrial Designer
8,What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .,User Interface
8,Uh menu .,Industrial Designer
8,"Yeah , to navigate .",Marketing
8,S Just uh like {disfmarker},User Interface

8,"Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button .",Industrial Designer
8,"The menu button , yes .",User Interface
8,{vocalsound},Marketing
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager
8,"Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it .",User Interface
8,{vocalsound} Mm okay .,Marketing
8,Yeah .,Project Manager
8,Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?,Marketing
8,Yeah .,Project Manager
8,Yep .,User Interface
8,"Uh and and you can hold it ,",Marketing
8,{gap},Project Manager
8,"you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .",Marketing
8,Yeah .,Project Manager
8,"Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?",User Interface
8,{gap} okay .,Marketing
8,"Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8,"Okay , yeah . Th Yeah .",Marketing
8,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
8,"If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .",Marketing
8,"That's that's very easy , yeah .",Project Manager

8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
8,Do you do you {disfmarker},Marketing
8,Yep .,Industrial Designer
8,Did you think of that ?,Marketing
8,"Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
8,Uh why not ?,User Interface
8,"Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .",Project Manager
8,Ex Yeah . Yeah .,Marketing
8,No {disfmarker} Whoa {disfmarker},User Interface
8,"Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the",Industrial Designer
8,I think um {disfmarker},User Interface
8,The sta the state you {disfmarker},Marketing
8,"Oh just three stages , you {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8,through view .,Industrial Designer

8,"No , it doesn't have to turn it off . Just don't {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface
8,No . Just remember where it was .,Marketing
8,Yeah .,User Interface
8,"It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?",Marketing
8,"Yes , that's to remember .",Project Manager
8,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer
8,"Yeah , but that's that's uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8,But maybe it's not the way {disfmarker},Marketing
8,I dunno if {gap} {disfmarker},User Interface
8,That's a functionality for the television . {vocalsound},Project Manager
8,"Yeah , I think as well , but {disfmarker} Uh yeah .",User Interface
8,Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .,Marketing
8,"Yeah mm nee uh {disfmarker} No , if i {vocalsound} uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .",Industrial Designer
8,"Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the",User Interface
8,"Okay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again .",Project Manager
8,the chip .,User Interface
8,Th i,Industrial Designer
8,That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that .,Project Manager
8,"Yeah , that's true .",User Interface
8,"Yeah , I dunno . Okay .",Industrial Designer
8,So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or {disfmarker},User Interface
8,"No , that's what the television does .",Project Manager
8,Mm {vocalsound} most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .,Marketing

8,"Yeah , that's fine .",Project Manager
8,Okay . So that's it ?,Industrial Designer
8,"Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?",Project Manager
8,"Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?",Marketing
8,Mm . No no,Industrial Designer
8,"Just like your telephone , hard plastic .",User Interface
8,Yeah . Just hard plastic . So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8,Okay .,Marketing
8,It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .,Project Manager
8,"Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh {disfmarker} And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?",Marketing

8,Yeah .,User Interface
8,"Yeah , but that's unnecessary .",Project Manager
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
8,What do I think is necessary necessary item ?,User Interface

8,Yeah .,Project Manager
8,{vocalsound} Of course it's reachable .,User Interface
8,It doesn't make {disfmarker},Project Manager

8,"{vocalsound} Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}",Marketing
8,"Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .",Project Manager
8,Yeah .,User Interface
8,It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker},Project Manager
8,"No , but you don't have to use that .",Industrial Designer
8,Yeah .,Marketing
8,And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .,Industrial Designer
8,No .,Project Manager
8,That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .,Industrial Designer
8,"So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker}",User Interface
8,Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .,Marketing
8,"Well , I think it is .",Industrial Designer
8,"Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .",Marketing
8,Well y just uh f,User Interface
8,"I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or",Marketing
8,"But the rest of it is very easy ,",Project Manager
8,{disfmarker} Uh then the re,Marketing
8,because there are so so n,Project Manager
8,"Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .",User Interface
8,So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .,Industrial Designer
8,Yes .,User Interface
8,Yeah .,Marketing
8,"But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .",User Interface
8,Okay .,Marketing
8,So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .,Project Manager
8,Okay .,Marketing
8,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker},User Interface
8,But {disfmarker},Marketing
8,"And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .",Project Manager
8,"Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?",Marketing
8,Device .,User Interface
8,"And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .",Marketing
8,But {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
8,'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use .,Marketing
8,Okay .,User Interface
8,Because easy to use comes after learnable .,Marketing
8,"Okay , just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool ,",Project Manager
8,I I think it a three or something .,Marketing
8,so just give it a two .,Project Manager
8,Maybe three then . Learnable's {disfmarker},User Interface
8,"No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .",Project Manager
8,Mm uh . The normal .,Industrial Designer
8,Yeah okay . Yeah .,User Interface
8,{vocalsound} And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know {disfmarker},Industrial Designer

9,"I think so , I think so ,",Project Manager
9,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9,"I'll be able to um pull it up ,",Project Manager

9,Okay .,Marketing
9,"So , it'd still be {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
9,Really ?,Project Manager
9,Right .,Marketing
9,"yeah , we had to buy one {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
9,So,Marketing
9,Mm . I think {disfmarker},Project Manager
9,"so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?",Marketing
9,"Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so",Project Manager
9,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
9,"Okay , pretty huge margin .",User Interface
9,half of the selling price is taken up by building it .,Project Manager
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,Mm .,Marketing
9,"Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros ,",Project Manager
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,which is uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
9,In our first year ?,Marketing
9,"Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing

9,You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups,Marketing
9,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
9,"just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone",Marketing
9,"No , yeah .",Project Manager
9,{disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay .,Marketing
9,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
9,Big target group {vocalsound} .,Marketing
9,"yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point ,",Project Manager
9,No .,Marketing
9,"just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .",Project Manager
9,Mm .,Marketing

9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,"Yeah ,",User Interface
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,Alright .,Marketing
9,that c,User Interface
9,"but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,",Project Manager
9,Yeah uh .,Industrial Designer
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,"but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .",Project Manager
9,Use all the ones at the same time .,Industrial Designer
9,Right .,Marketing
9,"Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}",User Interface
9,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
9,Okay .,User Interface
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,'cause you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9,"My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,",Marketing
9,Mm .,Project Manager
9,"I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .",Marketing
9,"Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean",Project Manager
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,{disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do,Project Manager
9,Mm .,Marketing
9,and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .,Project Manager
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,"Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,",Marketing
9,Yeah .,Project Manager
9,symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .,Marketing
9,So simplification of symbols you could think of .,User Interface
9,"{vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .",Project Manager
9,Oh yeah . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,"'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,",Project Manager
9,Mm .,Marketing
9,"it's obvious what you're doing , um .",Project Manager
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,Mm .,Industrial Designer
9,"Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,",Marketing
9,"Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .",User Interface
9,"I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,",Marketing
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,Uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface
9,so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .,Marketing
9,"Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .",User Interface
9,"With menus , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
9,"And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .",User Interface
9,Yeah .,Marketing
9,What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?,Project Manager
9,{vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number .,User Interface
9,"Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .",Project Manager
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?,Marketing
9,Right .,User Interface
9,"I don't think they tape things ,",Project Manager
9,"Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
9,I don't think they use {disfmarker},Project Manager
9,"Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,",Marketing
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,"that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,",Marketing
9,"Mm , yeah , the age gap .",Project Manager
9,"Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .",Industrial Designer
9,Mm .,Project Manager
9,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9,"I don't know , I d",Project Manager
9,But I don't know how {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9,"I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .",Project Manager
9,Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,"I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one",Project Manager
9,Right .,Marketing
9,"and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .",Project Manager
9,"Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,",Industrial Designer
9,{vocalsound},Marketing
9,Yeah .,Project Manager
9,"you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .",Industrial Designer
9,Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?,Marketing
9,Okay .,User Interface
9,Teletext has got that option as well .,Project Manager
9,"Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .",Marketing
9,"Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things",Project Manager
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,"and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .",Project Manager
9,"{vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .",Marketing
9,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
9,"Mm , okay . S",User Interface
9,"I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}",Project Manager
9,Y,Industrial Designer
9,It might,User Interface
9,Yeah ?,Marketing
9,"it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .",User Interface
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9,"Yes , no that's important .",Project Manager
9,But it might have its cost implications .,User Interface
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,"Yeah , like smaller .",Marketing
9,Okay .,Project Manager
9,"And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?",Marketing
9,Mm .,Project Manager
9,Right .,User Interface
9,Something that's easily moulded and produced .,Marketing
9,Yeah .,Project Manager
9,Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . {vocalsound},Marketing
9,"{vocalsound} Um , right , okay",Project Manager
9,No uh uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9,"we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .",Project Manager
9,Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9,Sure .,Project Manager
9,"about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui",Industrial Designer
9,Ah right .,Marketing
9,Okay .,User Interface
9,Okay .,Project Manager
9,Okay .,Marketing
9,I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic,Industrial Designer
9,Sure b y yeah .,Marketing
9,and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9,"But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point ,",Marketing
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,"we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,",Marketing
9,Mm .,Project Manager
9,I presume it would .,Marketing
9,I would {disfmarker},Project Manager
9,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
9,"it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,",Project Manager
9,Right .,Marketing
9,so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .,Project Manager
9,Okay .,Marketing
9,"Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ?",Project Manager
9,Okay .,Industrial Designer
9,'Kay .,Marketing
9,"So , see you in half an hour .",Project Manager
9,Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?,Marketing
9,"Mm , yeah .",User Interface
9,"I think so , yeah .",Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .,Project Manager
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,"So ,",Project Manager
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
10,as the previous meeting I will be the secretary,Project Manager
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
10,and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,"No y you do the minutes first , or ?",Marketing
10,What ?,Project Manager
10,No ?,Marketing
10,"I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .",Project Manager
10,Okay .,Marketing
10,Yep .,User Interface
10,"So , we'll {disfmarker} S",Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,technical accessoire ?,Project Manager
10,No no no .,User Interface
10,Interface ?,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,This .,Project Manager
10,"Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um",User Interface
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer
10,Mm .,Marketing
10,A nice one .,Industrial Designer
10,"attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .",User Interface
10,{vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .,Project Manager
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know",User Interface
10,"{vocalsound} It's very big ,",Project Manager
10,if you're {disfmarker},User Interface
10,{vocalsound} yeah .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,"It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,",User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
10,yeah .,User Interface
10,"Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
10,"We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,",Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,so .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,Mm .,Marketing
10,"So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,",User Interface
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
10,Mm .,Marketing
10,"so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .",User Interface
10,Okay . Something else ?,Project Manager
10,Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .,User Interface
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,"I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,",Project Manager
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
10,"but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?",Project Manager
10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
10,"Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?",Project Manager
10,Y,User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .,Industrial Designer
10,"or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?",Project Manager
10,Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .,User Interface
10,"Yeah , sure .",Project Manager
10,"For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .",User Interface
10,I,Project Manager
10,"Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so .",Industrial Designer
10,That's true . {vocalsound},Project Manager
10,One and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .",Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,Mm .,Marketing
10,So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . {vocalsound},User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?,Marketing
10,Broken arm ?,Project Manager
10,For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker},User Interface
10,Okay . Okay .,Marketing
10,"Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?",Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,{vocalsound} Yep . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway .,Marketing
10,Why ?,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .",User Interface
10,If you have one brother and one sister,Project Manager
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Marketing
10,"and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,",Project Manager
10,"Yeah , but the {disfmarker}",Marketing
10,"so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,",Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah,Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , it's very interesting . {vocalsound}",User Interface
10,Yeah but this {disfmarker},Marketing
10,so .,Project Manager
10,but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control,Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,because the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
10,I don't think it {disfmarker},Marketing
10,"but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .",Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} That's right .,Industrial Designer
10,You're not you're not obliged to share it .,Project Manager
10,"Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .",Marketing
10,"Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
10,"Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,",User Interface
10,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,No .,Marketing
10,"so it's c come to channel three ,",User Interface
10,"No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .",Marketing
10,I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface
10,"Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .",Project Manager
10,It's advantage .,User Interface
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to,Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , but one other question .",Project Manager
10,"manual controllers , eh .",Industrial Designer
10,How how much will it cost ?,Project Manager
10,"No , more expensive maybe .",Industrial Designer
10,How much ?,User Interface
10,Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .,Project Manager
10,No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker},User Interface
10,Some some efficient .,Project Manager
10,Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker},Marketing
10,"No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .",User Interface
10,So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ? Or ?,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}",User Interface
10,"Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10,it's uh {disfmarker} yeah . It's {disfmarker},User Interface
10,"But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .",Marketing
10,"Well y y you have also the language problem ,",Industrial Designer
10,No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface
10,you know when you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,Mm-mm .,Project Manager
10,"'Cause it it have to be universal ,",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah . I agree with uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,so .,Industrial Designer
10,"The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .",User Interface
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,"Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international",Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,"The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,",Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,so .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation",User Interface
10,"Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}",Marketing
10,Yeah but you know . The product {disfmarker} The pro,Industrial Designer
10,mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .,User Interface
10,"{vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
10,"Mm , okay .",Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",User Interface
10,And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?,Project Manager
10,it's {disfmarker},User Interface
10,Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .,User Interface
10,"Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10,So {disfmarker},User Interface
10,"Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
10,"If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .",Industrial Designer
10,Mm .,Marketing
10,"Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .",User Interface
10,"Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker},User Interface
10,Oh really ? {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,Oh .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah ,",Marketing
10,Seems to be quite complex .,Project Manager
10,"but then w Yeah ,",Marketing
10,Comple,Industrial Designer
10,"No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} .",User Interface
10,we have to take care of the twelve Euros,Marketing
10,"And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?",Project Manager
10,problem .,Marketing
10,And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?,Project Manager
10,No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller .,User Interface
10,"Yeah , but where is the controller ?",Project Manager
10,Okay .,Marketing
10,Where is the controller ?,User Interface
10,Yeah .,Project Manager
10,"It's in your family , in your home . {vocalsound}",User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , but we're {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10,"No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker}",Marketing
10,here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .,Project Manager
10,Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .,User Interface
10,A microphone maybe .,Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .",Project Manager
10,To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .,Industrial Designer
10,You just want to interact with television .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you",User Interface
10,"I if you say one , he switch to channel ,",Industrial Designer
10,you use your command,User Interface
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager
10,yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,and you do s your gesture .,User Interface
10,but you can lose it . {vocalsound},Project Manager
10,No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker},User Interface
10,So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .,Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box,Project Manager
10,Devic,Industrial Designer
10,and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control .,Industrial Designer
10,Ah .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,But you would still have the buttons . Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?,Marketing
10,think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker},User Interface
10,"Okay , so you {disfmarker}",Marketing
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
10,yeah .,User Interface
10,yeah .,Marketing
10,You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another .,User Interface
10,Mm .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .",Marketing
10,I think so .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,"No ,",User Interface
10,And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,that's quite inter quite attractive .,User Interface
10,"But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y",Industrial Designer
10,"Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . {vocalsound}",User Interface
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Marketing
10,Yeah but i i {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
10,I dunno .,Marketing
10,We should have confidence in technology . {vocalsound},User Interface
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , we should . {vocalsound} Uh .",Industrial Designer
10,"Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .",Project Manager
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer
10,What ?,Marketing
10,"Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?",Project Manager
10,"If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .",Marketing
10,"More features , yeah .",User Interface
10,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,But if if if it like doubles uh,Marketing
10,"I think he need a control that is very reliable ,",Industrial Designer
10,no one would would be interested .,Marketing
10,so .,Industrial Designer
10,So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?,Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},User Interface
10,"Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?",Project Manager
10,"Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?",User Interface
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah . No ,",Marketing
10,Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker},User Interface
10,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing
10,It's not really the {disfmarker} we,Industrial Designer
10,Y,Marketing
10,"we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that . But uh I think a user need {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,",User Interface
10,"No ,",Marketing
10,but {disfmarker},User Interface
10,"but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,",Marketing
10,Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah,Industrial Designer
10,Okay .,User Interface
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing
10,if we can send email from it .,Industrial Designer
10,"But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .",User Interface
10,No . No .,Marketing
10,Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing
10,"Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,",User Interface
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,"Yeah , but uh we want so",Project Manager
10,"but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .",User Interface
10,"Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker}",Marketing
10,That's {disfmarker},User Interface
10,True .,Marketing
10,"the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products .",User Interface
10,"Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .",Project Manager
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,"{vocalsound} And for all the person of the family maybe ,",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
10,You don't need to tune it .,Project Manager
10,"so , yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?",User Interface
10,"Yeah , why not ? If it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10,"I mean , for example the goo y",Marketing
10,Because you have new {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .,Marketing
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
10,"I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine ,",Marketing
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,"so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .",Marketing
10,"Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .",User Interface
10,"Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition",Marketing
10,The {disfmarker} then nn,User Interface
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing
10,no .,User Interface
10,"if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .",Marketing
10,Tha,User Interface
10,Not too expensive too .,Project Manager
10,But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .,User Interface
10,See {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Marketing
10,That's the same {disfmarker},User Interface
10,"That's the problem ,",Marketing
10,yeah .,User Interface
10,"yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .",Marketing
10,{vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,"But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product",Marketing
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,and so .,Marketing
10,Okay . So,Project Manager
10,"I mean , that's the point .",Marketing
10,let's go to the Industrial Designer .,Project Manager
10,{vocalsound},User Interface
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,Okay .,User Interface
10,"Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .",Project Manager
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,Two ?,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,Working ?,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , working design ,",Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},User Interface
10,so .,Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,So I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,I can {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ? I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one .,Industrial Designer
10,Okay .,Project Manager
10,It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing
10,It's the working design . Sorry . {vocalsound} Component design .,Industrial Designer
10,It's okay {vocalsound},Project Manager
10,So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10,What ? Are you inst,Industrial Designer
10,Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .,User Interface
10,Maybe you you record it somewhere else .,Project Manager
10,I don't think so .,Industrial Designer
10,Participant one . Participant one .,User Interface
10,Interface concept . No .,Project Manager
10,Hmm .,Marketing
10,Mm mm .,Project Manager
10,Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer .,Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,Uh . {vocalsound} Nope . {vocalsound},Project Manager
10,Dunno .,Marketing
10,"Okay , okay . Yes .",Industrial Designer
10,It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker},Marketing
10,I can say it to you without .,Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10,"Yeah , maybe we can first come to",User Interface
10,"No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10,"uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,",User Interface
10,"I think it's more interesting what he says ,",Marketing
10,Yeah .,Project Manager
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
10,then present it later .,User Interface
10,okay .,Marketing
10,exac,Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,You will had s some more information in {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , true .",Marketing
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,Okay . {vocalsound},User Interface
10,"In fact , I don't know ,",Industrial Designer
10,So . Okay .,Project Manager
10,I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},User Interface
10,"Okay , never mind .",Project Manager
10,so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r,Industrial Designer
10,Okay .,User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside,Industrial Designer
10,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
10,"and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,",Industrial Designer
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
10,"so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,",Industrial Designer
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
10,"so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,",Industrial Designer
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
10,"or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .",Industrial Designer
10,Okay .,Project Manager
10,Okay .,User Interface
10,"And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation",Industrial Designer
10,Uh-huh .,User Interface
10,"or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come",Industrial Designer
10,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,User Interface
10,"and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control",Project Manager
10,"Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .",Industrial Designer
10,and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers,Project Manager
10,"Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah . Yeah .,Marketing
10,"and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,",Project Manager
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,no ?,Project Manager
10,"Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,",Industrial Designer
10,So .,Project Manager
10,"but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,Okay .,Project Manager
10,so hmm .,Industrial Designer
10,And what tha what about the uh materials ?,Project Manager
10,"And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common",Industrial Designer
10,"Impersonal , mm-hmm .",Project Manager
10,"it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Project Manager
10,Special for {disfmarker},Marketing
10,"or you know , you can have some {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .",Project Manager
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
10,"Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood",Industrial Designer
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,Mm-hmm . Mm .,Project Manager
10,and it can be interesting .,Industrial Designer
10,"Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .",Project Manager
10,"And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .",Project Manager
10,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,And you think that we will be {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,"Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,",Industrial Designer
10,Okay .,Project Manager
10,so .,Industrial Designer
10,So wood .,Project Manager
10,{gap},Industrial Designer
10,And what about the buttons ?,Project Manager
10,"I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion",Industrial Designer
10,"No it's fashion , yeah .",Project Manager
10,"and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .",Industrial Designer
10,What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .,Marketing
10,{vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .,Industrial Designer
10,Mm .,Marketing
10,"But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,So you got email ?,User Interface
10,I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .,Project Manager
10,Okay .,Marketing
10,Participant four ? Functional requirements ?,Project Manager
10,"Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}",Marketing
10,This one ?,Project Manager
10,"Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .",Marketing
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10,"So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically",Marketing
10,Mm .,User Interface
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer
10,"but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .",Marketing
10,Okay .,Project Manager
10,"At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .",Marketing
10,{gap},Industrial Designer
10,"Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,",Marketing
10,Ah yes .,Industrial Designer
10,"okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .",Marketing
10,"Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,"'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .",Marketing
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,"So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris",Marketing
10,And fruit and vegetables yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,"we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,",Marketing
10,{vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .,Industrial Designer
10,okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .,Marketing
10,"Okay , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,I dunno .,Marketing
10,"Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah thi this is this would be like um,Marketing
10,Pla S,Industrial Designer
10,"plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh",Marketing
10,"Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,"device , so um",Marketing
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,"Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .",Marketing
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,"So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,",Project Manager
10,Yeah . Solar .,Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}",Marketing
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,maybe will attract,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,Mm-hmm,Marketing
10,It will be a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,pro-ecology consumers .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . Yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,Case .,Project Manager
10,Later ? {vocalsound},User Interface
10,So you think {gap} case . Something spongy . {vocalsound} Someth no wood .,Project Manager
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound},User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Marketing
10,{vocalsound} No wood but {disfmarker} Plastic ?,Industrial Designer
10,"Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .",Marketing
10,Would some {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,Pla,User Interface
10,Maybe you {disfmarker},Project Manager
10,"I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want ,",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , maybe the base .",Marketing
10,so .,Industrial Designer
10,It's it's natural .,Project Manager
10,But still y,Marketing
10,"Th The feeling is natural ,",Project Manager
10,"Yeah , it's natural",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,and i,Industrial Designer
10,so maybe we can stay with wood .,Project Manager
10,"And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .",Marketing
10,"Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .",Industrial Designer
10,But it's still fashion .,Project Manager
10,"But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,",Marketing
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,or,Marketing
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
10,I dunno .,Marketing
10,something that you can {vocalsound} into it .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,Uh and what about the user interface concept ?,Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} Google and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10,Google and fancy ?,Project Manager
10,"and fancy , f how about the the voice ? {vocalsound} And {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
10,Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .,Project Manager
10,Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested,Industrial Designer
10,Uh yes .,User Interface
10,and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control .,Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Marketing
10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
10,Mm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,The smart controller . {vocalsound},User Interface
10,"But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,",Industrial Designer
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager
10,so .,Industrial Designer
10,but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .,Project Manager
10,"But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .",Industrial Designer
10,That's true .,Project Manager
10,Yeah {disfmarker} d,Marketing
10,Okay .,User Interface
10,"So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,",Project Manager
10,I dunno .,Marketing
10,Mm .,User Interface
10,"maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .",Project Manager
10,Yeah . It's good .,User Interface
10,And L_C_D_ buttons .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , L_C_D_ .",Industrial Designer
10,"Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .",Project Manager
10,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,What interface ?,Marketing
10,"Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value .",Project Manager
10,"I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
10,"commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .",Project Manager
10,Yeah . Mm .,Industrial Designer
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
10,"To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .",Industrial Designer
10,Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , turning {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,",Industrial Designer
10,"So ,",Project Manager
10,so .,Industrial Designer
10,adding some vocal commands .,Project Manager
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,Simple ones ?,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , simple ones for {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,"Okay . {vocalsound} So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} we'll {disfmarker} you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .",Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10,Yep . Yeah .,User Interface
10,"Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons {vocalsound}",Project Manager
10,"{vocalsound} expensive buttons {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , to make some new {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10,and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .,Project Manager
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10,{vocalsound} And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .,Project Manager
10,"Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .",Marketing
10,Yeah .,Project Manager
10,"Okay , fruits .",Industrial Designer
10,Yeah .,Project Manager
10,If possible .,Marketing
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,"And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really {disfmarker} it will be seen in the remote control .",Project Manager
10,"Need it to be , okay .",Industrial Designer
10,"So you will have {disfmarker} Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,",Project Manager
10,Yeah .,User Interface
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,so you will have to model model something .,Project Manager
10,Okay . Yep,User Interface
10,And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .,Project Manager
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
10,"So ,",Project Manager
10,Okay .,User Interface
10,"no more questions , we can close the session .",Project Manager
10,"Sounds good , mm-hmm .",Industrial Designer
10,Hmm .,Marketing
10,"Yeah . Okay , cool .",Project Manager
10,Okay .,Marketing
11,Okay .,Marketing
11,"'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,And I can start if you want . Mm .,Marketing
11,sure .,Project Manager
11,Is there an order ? No .,Marketing
11,Hm ?,Project Manager
11,We haven't decided on an order .,Marketing
11,"No , any any order's fine . Yeah .",Project Manager
11,"First . Okay . Um , how do I put this {disfmarker}",Marketing
11,Just uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
11,I'll just put the cable in .,Marketing
11,"Oh yeah , sorry .",Project Manager
11,"{gap} Is that it ? Can you see ? {vocalsound} Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ?",Marketing
11,It sh it takes a few seconds I think .,Project Manager
11,You may need to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
11,{vocalsound} Who's that ? {vocalsound},User Interface
11,{vocalsound},Marketing
11,{vocalsound},User Interface
11,No .,Marketing
11,But sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
11,Is it in the right thing ?,Marketing
11,"it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .",Industrial Designer
11,"Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . {vocalsound}",Marketing
11,"Uh-huh , and then press function .",Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},Marketing
11,and F_ eight .,Project Manager
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker},User Interface
11,"Oh , wait .",Marketing
11,oh .,User Interface
11,That's {disfmarker} is that it ?,Marketing
11,Adjusting .,Industrial Designer
11,Here we are . {vocalsound},Project Manager
11,"The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .",Industrial Designer
11,Right here we are .,Marketing
11,Oh . Is it on ?,Project Manager
11,We're here .,Marketing
11,Okay .,Project Manager
11,"Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .",Marketing
11,Hm .,Project Manager
11,"Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .",Marketing
11,'Kay .,Project Manager
11,Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?,Marketing
11,Yeah . Just move right on .,Project Manager
11,"Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?",User Interface
11,{vocalsound} Uh function F_ eight .,Project Manager
11,Function F_ eight .,Marketing
11,'Kay . What's function ?,User Interface
11,It's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th,Project Manager
11,"Oh function , I see it .",User Interface
11,yeah . Yeah should be {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,There we go . {vocalsound},User Interface
11,It should be {gap} yeah .,Project Manager
11,Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} .,User Interface
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager
11,"And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .",User Interface
11,{gap},Project Manager
11,Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh .,User Interface
11,How do I um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
11,S That's on view .,Marketing
11,Right .,Industrial Designer
11,Oh .,Marketing
11,"Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .",Industrial Designer
11,'Kay .,Project Manager
11,Do you know about like {disfmarker},User Interface
11,Mm ?,Industrial Designer
11,"I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface
11,"Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .",Industrial Designer
11,Okay . Cool . {vocalsound},User Interface
11,"Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,",Project Manager
11,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,"also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . {vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,"I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,Like in terms of,User Interface
11,How it looks or {disfmarker},Marketing
11,"how it looks , or like what it does ?",User Interface
11,wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s,Project Manager
11,Okay .,User Interface
11,the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .,Project Manager
11,Yeah . Okay . So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?,User Interface
11,{vocalsound} I think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . Mm .,Project Manager
11,So {disfmarker},User Interface
11,It's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer
11,Okay . So the {disfmarker},User Interface
11,"{gap} the the buzzer you mean ,",Marketing
11,"yeah , yeah , yeah .",User Interface
11,Locator .,Industrial Designer
11,"yeah , for sure , yeah .",Marketing
11,"So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,",User Interface
11,"Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .",Project Manager
11,what was it ?,User Interface
11,Well that's for speech recognition .,Marketing
11,"Oh , uh .",Project Manager
11,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
11,Oh .,User Interface
11,And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .,Marketing
11,"I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing
11,Mm .,Project Manager
11,"or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly ,",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing
11,I'm not sure how you would implement it .,Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,I just put the values {vocalsound} in .,Marketing
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,"And if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},User Interface
11,"But um the screen is the same as what , {gap}",Marketing
11,It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,"if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .",Project Manager
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,"Yeah , I'm happy with that .",Marketing
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,Right so um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
11,Hu yeah .,User Interface
11,{vocalsound} Completely .,Marketing
11,Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .,User Interface
11,Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .,Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,"Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .",Industrial Designer
11,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Okay .,Project Manager
11,Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .,Industrial Designer
11,Alright .,User Interface
11,Okay .,Marketing
11,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface
11,So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
11,"right . Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
11,"So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?",Marketing
11,"Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .",Industrial Designer
11,Okay . Okay .,Marketing
11,So it's now like a two-part thing .,User Interface
11,"Yeah , so it would be a two part package .",Industrial Designer
11,Okay . Alright .,User Interface
11,Okay .,Marketing
11,So we get to design that too .,User Interface
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,"{vocalsound} Make it fashionable . Um , okay .",User Interface
11,So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .,Project Manager
11,Yeah I think so .,Industrial Designer
11,Yeah . Just there .,Marketing
11,Huh . Okay .,Project Manager
11,Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it .,Marketing
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?,Marketing
11,"We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,Okay .,Marketing
11,Yeah . Then it can live anywhere .,User Interface
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,"Okay . For the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?",Marketing
11,Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ?,Industrial Designer
11,Are we just having a radio ? On the phone .,Marketing
11,"Um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,",Industrial Designer
11,T,User Interface
11,You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"I think that's what the phone has ,",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah yeah .,Marketing
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .",Industrial Designer
11,"And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so",Project Manager
11,You can hear it's under the couch yeah .,Marketing
11,{disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
11,So i Yeah .,User Interface
11,"Um , {vocalsound} {gap} So need the other buttons . So we have this {disfmarker} mm .",Marketing
11,"So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um ,",Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,That was that was me .,User Interface
11,Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},Marketing
11,"they're {disfmarker} I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .",Project Manager
11,I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes .,User Interface
11,"Oh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .",Project Manager
11,And uh,User Interface
11,Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ?,Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,They're not {disfmarker} no .,Project Manager
11,"They're not , no .",Marketing
11,"Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .",Industrial Designer
11,S,User Interface
11,"Yeah , that's right , yeah .",Project Manager
11,{vocalsound} It not V_H_S_ here ?,Marketing
11,But D_V_D_ probably is .,Project Manager
11,"Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .",Industrial Designer
11,Um {disfmarker},User Interface
11,"And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .",Project Manager
11,"But V_C_R_s {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , for sure .",Marketing
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
11,"Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,",User Interface
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .",User Interface
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"Well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much ,",Marketing
11,S,Project Manager
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,Huh .,Project Manager
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,s and it's usually that red,Marketing
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .,Marketing
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,"You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,"Oh okay , yeah .",Marketing
11,It seems like that would be hard though .,User Interface
11,But {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,"I mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker}",User Interface
11,It might be confusing . Yeah .,Project Manager
11,yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't {disfmarker} I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound},User Interface
11,Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .,Project Manager
11,"Yeah , I never think to hold something down . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,{vocalsound} I have the power {vocalsound},Project Manager
11,Yeah . B {vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface
11,I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .,Project Manager
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,"Well even um iPod thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of",Marketing
11,"That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .",User Interface
11,scrolling {disfmarker} I don't know .,Marketing
11,Mm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,Yeah . Because people li seem {disfmarker} now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no {disfmarker} Know you don't have one two three four five {disfmarker},Marketing
11,"Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,",User Interface
11,Mm .,Project Manager
11,"it's it's funny like you f like I just {disfmarker} I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and {disfmarker} it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .",User Interface
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"Yeah yeah , it's just {disfmarker} and it's one thing which has everything .",Marketing
11,"Yeah , and it is {disfmarker} yeah . It is really {disfmarker} but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?",User Interface
11,Well can't it tell the {disfmarker} like can't you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker},Marketing
11,"Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah . Okay .,User Interface
11,you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker},Marketing
11,Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .,User Interface
11,Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .,User Interface
11,okay . I've never used one . No .,Project Manager
11,"It's like l this {disfmarker} like that , and then you do that .",Marketing
11,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
11,Yeah . Yeah and then .,User Interface
11,"And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .",Marketing
11,Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker},User Interface
11,"Yeah , you can {disfmarker}",Marketing
11,Well i,Project Manager
11,zap .,User Interface
11,"Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker}",Marketing
11,Okay .,User Interface
11,"We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .",Project Manager
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom {disfmarker} So do you need to {disfmarker},User Interface
11,"Doesn't it rotate though ,",Industrial Designer
11,okay .,User Interface
11,so it'll be moving around .,Industrial Designer
11,Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker},User Interface
11,What do you mean the function ?,Marketing
11,"I mean like okay , 'cause so {disfmarker} I dunno , I guess {disfmarker} Okay {disfmarker} so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .",User Interface
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
11,But then {disfmarker},User Interface
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,"so if you wanna switch to the {disfmarker} to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .",User Interface
11,Yeah but it knows for some reason .,Marketing
11,It just {disfmarker},User Interface
11,The iPod knows .,Marketing
11,It just kno {vocalsound} the iPod knows . {vocalsound} S,User Interface
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager
11,{vocalsound} If it works on an iPod then it works .,Industrial Designer
11,{vocalsound},Marketing
11,Huh .,Project Manager
11,Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .,User Interface
11,I don't have one .,Industrial Designer
11,"Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .",Marketing
11,"Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .",User Interface
11,Oh .,Industrial Designer
11,So it's like holding {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,"And then {disfmarker} well if you do that it goes , but if you {disfmarker} like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .",Marketing
11,You can {disfmarker} o And you you {disfmarker} is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually {disfmarker} you're just using the mouse to go up and down .,Project Manager
11,Well what you {disfmarker},Marketing
11,Like {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,It's like a b,User Interface
11,"for the iPod you press an {disfmarker} w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .",Marketing
11,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
11,"But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker}",Marketing
11,"Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?",Project Manager
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Like you could just have {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,"I don't know ,",Marketing
11,"Oh , like {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,"you could click and then have it up and down ,",Marketing
11,Oh you could actually {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,Like {disfmarker},User Interface
11,but I think {disfmarker},Marketing
11,I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .,User Interface
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
11,"But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be {disfmarker} is that part of {disfmarker}",User Interface
11,Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,{vocalsound} I don't think so .,Industrial Designer
11,"yeah , I dunno , I dunno .",User Interface
11,"they have so much memory though , that's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
11,You don't think so ? Okay .,User Interface
11,I don't think it's the wheel dealy .,Industrial Designer
11,I think it {disfmarker},Marketing
11,Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they {disfmarker} it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .,Project Manager
11,Okay .,User Interface
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Yeah . {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
11,Yeah . I'm thinking we could {disfmarker} if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .,User Interface
11,And they're re-programmable aren't they ?,Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"You can put on your songs and then put on a different set ,",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,S,Project Manager
11,"Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker}",User Interface
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
11,"Yeah yeah yeah . Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation {vocalsound} , is that people find it {disfmarker} find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote",Marketing
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,and that's another thing they complained about .,Marketing
11,Mm .,Project Manager
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,"Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume {disfmarker} oh we've ts just said that .",Marketing
11,So okay .,User Interface
11,Channel selection .,Marketing
11,"This is just for T_V_ , it's not for {disfmarker} or it is {disfmarker} does need to be compatible with {disfmarker}",User Interface
11,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,"I {disfmarker} A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,",Industrial Designer
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,"You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .",Project Manager
11,So how do you switch {disfmarker},User Interface
11,Menu .,Marketing
11,and menu maybe . Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer
11,So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,Okay . So like if we had that {disfmarker},User Interface
11,But we'll hold off on that 'cause {disfmarker},Project Manager
11,Yeah .,User Interface
11,But s yeah uh .,Project Manager
11,But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .,Marketing
11,"That's true , yeah .",User Interface
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,"So , I know I'm not c really clear on what {disfmarker}",User Interface
11,"But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .",Industrial Designer
11,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface
11,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
11,Mm . Mm .,Project Manager
11,So you'd have to have like {disfmarker},User Interface
11,Yeah .,Marketing
11,"I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So {disfmarker}",User Interface
11,Yeah .,Project Manager
11,Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .,Industrial Designer
11,"Yeah ,",User Interface
11,"Yeah , it is only fun",Marketing
11,"but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .",User Interface
11,But i Yeah .,Project Manager
11,Oh . But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
11,Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker},User Interface
11,but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .,Industrial Designer
11,"So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that ,",User Interface
11,"Um , yeah , let's think about it",Project Manager
11,that like {disfmarker},User Interface
11,Yes we can try that .,Industrial Designer
11,'cause we need to wrap up .,Project Manager
11,{vocalsound},User Interface
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager
12,It's {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Bonjour .,Marketing
12,It won't wake up . Yeah . I was a bit early . Like {disfmarker} What ?,User Interface

12,Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ?,User Interface
12,The power light doesn't work . You turned it off .,Marketing
12,"But how ? Ah , there it is .",User Interface
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,Uh .,User Interface
12,I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you .,Industrial Designer
12,"Okay , we're just going to the {gap} later .",Project Manager
12,Okay .,Marketing
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , I received an email as well .",User Interface
12,So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .,Project Manager
12,{vocalsound} Oh .,Marketing
12,{gap},Project Manager
12,Hmm .,Marketing
12,Which one was mine ?,User Interface
12,So that's me .,Project Manager
12,{vocalsound},Marketing
12,"Uh okay . So {disfmarker} Uh okay . Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . {gap} What's it called , I dunno . Whatever .",Project Manager
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,The minutes .,User Interface
12,"Okay , so we just talked about uh {disfmarker} Oh you want me to show that there or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,"No ,",User Interface
12,Mm no .,Industrial Designer
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,"Okay ,",Project Manager
12,just tell us .,User Interface
12,"we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um {disfmarker} It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ?",Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,Yes .,User Interface
12,"So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,Shall I start ?,Marketing
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,"{gap} {vocalsound} No . Okay well {disfmarker} I received an email {disfmarker} Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . {vocalsound} The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .",Marketing
12,Hmm .,User Interface
12,"But um {vocalsound} this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .",Marketing
12,But we already have the flashing flashing light on the {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,{vocalsound} Uh maybe maybe something new .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , more .",User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,"We have to discuss about it s uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh {gap}",Marketing
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,"Well , I'll I'll get back on it .",User Interface
12,features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .,Marketing
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,"So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .",Marketing
12,Hmm .,Project Manager
12,"But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .",Marketing
12,Spongy .,User Interface
12,"But spongy , what what does spongy says ?",Marketing
12,Spongy .,Industrial Designer
12,"Spongy , like sponge .",User Interface
12,Spongy . Okay . {vocalsound},Marketing
12,"So rubber , kind of .",Industrial Designer
12,Uh soft materials .,User Interface
12,"But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,",Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be {vocalsound} flexible .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .",Marketing
12,It's like a sponge .,Industrial Designer
12,"Soft , sponge .",User Interface
12,So it's also a stress-ball .,Marketing
12,"That's a good {disfmarker} That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , somewhat like {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface
12,Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ?,Project Manager
12,How are you gonna make it ?,User Interface
12,R_ soft .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,"I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .",Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,Okay ?,Marketing
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
12,"What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .",Marketing
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .,Marketing
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,"And uh some basic uh colour fronts . {vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . {vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .",Marketing
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,"Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .",Marketing
12,"Yeah , I'll get back on that .",User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,So {disfmarker},Marketing
12,{vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .,Project Manager
12,Intro,Marketing
12,Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Marketing
12,"Well ,",User Interface
12,"Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .",Marketing
12,I got f also an email from the the technology department .,User Interface
12,So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .,Marketing
12,"They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .",User Interface
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,Well {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Marketing
12,I'll check what they exact mean .,User Interface
12,Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .,Marketing
12,So uh {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
12,and it's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer
12,"th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh",User Interface
12,{gap},Marketing
12,"if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .",User Interface
12,"Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker}",Marketing
12,Since you have to uh configure speech thing .,User Interface
12,But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
12,"Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .",User Interface
12,"Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} .",Marketing
12,"Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , so uh we gotta de",User Interface
12,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,We have to decide on that .,User Interface
12,Yeah . Okay . That was this ?,Marketing
12,Mm uh {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So",Industrial Designer
12,L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .",Industrial Designer
12,Okay . And speech recognition ?,User Interface
12,"Yeah , probably too .",Industrial Designer
12,Advanced {gap} . Yeah .,User Interface
12,"I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,I'll I'll give you my design .,User Interface
12,"Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah okay . So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .,User Interface
12,"Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .",Project Manager
12,"More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,"It's the most important part , I think . But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .",User Interface
12,"Yeah , maybe the teletext tel",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,",User Interface
12,No .,Project Manager
12,but it's {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it .",Marketing
12,Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,"and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display .,Industrial Designer
12,No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .,User Interface
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,So the focus is on these two parts .,User Interface
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,So you don't see all the buttons you else need .,User Interface
12,{vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .,Project Manager
12,Uh well um {disfmarker},User Interface
12,So you can't use your thumb for it .,Project Manager
12,This is how it is now . Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume .,User Interface
12,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
12,I think it is on uh on the bottom too .,Industrial Designer
12,down there . But it's not not the best best .,Project Manager
12,Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , why not .",Project Manager
12,For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .,User Interface
12,Scroll .,Industrial Designer
12,By just putting the volume on the side .,User Interface
12,And the channels as well .,Project Manager
12,And and just channel buttons here .,User Interface
12,Oh yeah .,Project Manager
12,But I think uh {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .",Industrial Designer
12,"Well . Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here .",User Interface
12,"Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , that's better .",Project Manager
12,They're on top ?,User Interface
12,"Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .",Project Manager
12,Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .,Industrial Designer
12,You mean uh these to the low ?,User Interface
12,Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button .,Project Manager
12,"Oh okay . Well , yeah .",User Interface
12,"But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom .",Industrial Designer
12,"Mm {disfmarker} Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .",User Interface
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
12,"And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good .",User Interface
12,"That's that's good , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,"{vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .",User Interface
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
12,"But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,"I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .",User Interface
12,"No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .",Industrial Designer
12,"Okay . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface
12,"But uh we we can switch those two ,",Industrial Designer
12,"Those two , yeah .",User Interface
12,yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,"And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . {gap}",User Interface
12,Okay .,Marketing
12,"Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .",User Interface
12,"Yeah . Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager
12,To use {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,"So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .",User Interface
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,No .,Industrial Designer
12,So that's something we have to decide on .,User Interface
12,"Yeah , we have to keep it simple .",Industrial Designer
12,"We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .",Project Manager
12,Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay .,User Interface
12,"Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like .",Industrial Designer
12,"Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
12,{vocalsound},Marketing
12,Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved {gap} square .,User Interface
12,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,Square . Like .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .",Industrial Designer
12,Okay . So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
12,So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .,User Interface
12,"Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control .",Project Manager
12,"looking , I think .",Industrial Designer
12,Mm .,Marketing
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,So the colours also .,Project Manager
12,"Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,"So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .",Project Manager
12,Black yellow control . {vocalsound},User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .,Project Manager
12,"No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
12,"We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .",Industrial Designer
12,"Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,"Yeah , it's cool . Yep .",Project Manager
12,Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue,Industrial Designer
12,And still trans,Project Manager
12,Yes .,User Interface
12,Still still transparent .,Project Manager
12,So {disfmarker},User Interface
12,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Oh yeah .,Marketing
12,Yeah . But with all with logo on it .,User Interface
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,"Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the components . The case has just a {disfmarker} Here's black .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
12,{gap} Yeah .,User Interface
12,"Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?",Industrial Designer
12,Well one of the options .,User Interface
12,S,Industrial Designer
12,"You can {disfmarker} Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .",User Interface
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,"So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,",User Interface
12,"Yeah , we could do that .",Industrial Designer
12,or just uh release one .,User Interface
12,"Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . {vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Or just uh sell different ones .",User Interface
12,"Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah . Cool .,Project Manager
12,So you can still th look through it .,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
12,Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,I uh I dunno .,User Interface
12,"It it could be like a Nokia , like {gap} plastic .",Project Manager
12,"A more {disfmarker} Yeah , just uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,{vocalsound} Uh uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,That's better prob,Project Manager
12,With the hard hard buttons .,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,I think uh rubber really has an odd look .,User Interface
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .",Marketing
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't {disfmarker} Is {vocalsound} uh a button uh um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How do you say it ?,Marketing
12,"Yeah , it's it's all on one level .",Industrial Designer
12,It it didn't it i it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , on one level .",Industrial Designer
12,It is in uh the c a remote control uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,"Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Marketing
12,like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod .,User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,Uh just {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager
12,"Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?",Industrial Designer
12,{vocalsound} I dunno what uh kind of material it is .,User Interface
12,I think . Or maybe {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,But {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh,Project Manager
12,Oops .,User Interface
12,"basic remote control from normal plastic ,",Project Manager
12,{vocalsound},Marketing
12,and,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,the rounds of it from softer s,Project Manager
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the L_E_D_ . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,I dunno .,Project Manager
12,The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s .,Industrial Designer
12,Y,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Cool .,Project Manager
12,"But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,So if you put {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Y i if you {disfmarker} The numbers could be can be {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,Or it runs the whole {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,They can choose .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah , you can halfs transparent ,",User Interface
12,Or no,Industrial Designer
12,or just that it's comes out a bit .,User Interface
12,"Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights",Industrial Designer
12,"Different , I think , also .",User Interface
12,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Blue . {vocalsound},Project Manager
12,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer
12,Blue or red .,User Interface
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,"Whatever you want it , I think .",User Interface
12,{gap} Yeah .,Marketing
12,Uh depends on the colour of the {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .",Project Manager
12,Uh i {gap} {vocalsound},Marketing
12,You have to choose {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,"Yeah , that's true . But {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,"No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,Is it {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah ,",Marketing
12,I I know {disfmarker} I dunno . Is {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?,Marketing
12,"Yeah , it can .",User Interface
12,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
12,'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .,User Interface
12,You {disfmarker},Marketing
12,Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .,Industrial Designer
12,"Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just {disfmarker} No , just some LED .",Project Manager
12,I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .,User Interface
12,I think it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,And I can change the colour of it .,User Interface
12,"Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it {disfmarker} I th I don't think so .",Industrial Designer
12,"Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,Hmm .,Marketing
12,Then uh some more technical things .,Industrial Designer
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
12,"I don't know what it is , but it should be there {vocalsound} I think .",Industrial Designer
12,{vocalsound},Marketing
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
12,{vocalsound},User Interface
12,"Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
12,W {vocalsound} So we d we just need this and {vocalsound} this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .,Industrial Designer
12,{vocalsound},User Interface
12,Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .,Industrial Designer
12,I'm sure we can fit in .,User Interface
12,So I guess we j we just need that .,Industrial Designer
12,{gap},Marketing
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,I don't know what they do or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface
12,"Okay yeah ,",Marketing
12,We just {disfmarker},User Interface
12,you can you can change {disfmarker} Yeah . No .,Marketing
12,"Nah , but they just said we need it .",Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,"Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , a recharger maybe .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , we have to make sure to uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
12,"We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?",Project Manager
12,Yeah but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Is that still the {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,Yes . Yes .,User Interface
12,"Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Accu .",Industrial Designer
12,A recha Oh no . Uh {disfmarker} Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .,Project Manager
12,Re recharger . Base station .,User Interface
12,"Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .",User Interface
12,Okay . Not a separate {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,"No , just rechargeable batteries .",Project Manager
12,"Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one .",Industrial Designer
12,{gap},Project Manager
12,Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh {disfmarker} Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .,Industrial Designer
12,Ah cool . Okay .,Marketing
12,But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .,Project Manager
12,"So if you hold it , it gets powered .",User Interface
12,"If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and {disfmarker} Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,",Industrial Designer
12,It's dark in the room . No .,Project Manager
12,{gap},User Interface
12,"It's just batteries ,",Project Manager
12,so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,{vocalsound},Marketing
12,that's cheaper {gap} .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,"Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .",Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Marketing
12,"So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .",Industrial Designer
12,Mm . So,User Interface
12,So we can't use the flat buttons .,Industrial Designer
12,we need uh two D_ .,User Interface
12,Yeah . Definitely .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used .",Industrial Designer
12,"But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .",Project Manager
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,"Yeah , I think so too .",Industrial Designer
12,"The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , scroll wheels um {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,"Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,But I think just the volume is enough .,Industrial Designer
12,"{gap} Uh {disfmarker} For channels it's not handy ,",User Interface
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,because you scroll too fast .,User Interface
12,"And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .",Industrial Designer
12,Mm {disfmarker},Marketing
12,I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .,Project Manager
12,"Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
12,Okay .,User Interface
12,"And um {disfmarker} Yeah , that was it I guess .",Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,"Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,Oh just sk,Project Manager
12,We haven't decided yet .,Industrial Designer
12,Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,Uh I don't think a rubber case looks {disfmarker},User Interface
12,L,Industrial Designer
12,Uh but we have to do something about the trend .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?",Industrial Designer
12,The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , okay . That {disfmarker} Uh fruit and veg , or {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .",User Interface
12,Uh yeah i Just {disfmarker} Just on front .,Marketing
12,"So you can {gap} the the spongy {disfmarker} yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control .",User Interface
12,No .,Project Manager
12,Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .,Marketing
12,No . {gap} {vocalsound},Project Manager
12,I just can't imagine it .,User Interface
12,{vocalsound} So just hard plastic ?,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I think .",User Interface
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,Titanium . It's mentioned here uh .,User Interface
12,"Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .",Industrial Designer
12,But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit,Project Manager
12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
12,more rounded .,Project Manager
12,"you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah . Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
12,Okay .,User Interface
12,So {disfmarker} We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger .,Project Manager
12,{gap},User Interface
12,We already know that . Just a normal battery .,Project Manager
12,Yeah . We have batteries .,User Interface
12,Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one .,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,Regular .,User Interface
12,"Okay , the case is just a plastic one .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular .",Project Manager
12,"You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second .",Industrial Designer
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,I think I'll just check it .,Industrial Designer
12,"And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . {gap}",Project Manager
12,Yes .,User Interface
12,That's pretty much it .,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,And a flashy light .,Project Manager
12,User interface concept .,User Interface
12,So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But {gap},Project Manager
12,I dunno either .,User Interface
12,Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?,Industrial Designer
12,Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .,User Interface
12,Yeah . That's for the next one .,Project Manager
12,So we should did it here ?,Industrial Designer
12,That's for th,Project Manager
12,So we're staying here ?,User Interface
12,Uh that {disfmarker} I think that's the next next meeting .,Project Manager
12,Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,But you definitely get a specific instruction . {vocalsound},Project Manager
12,"Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,But th think about something that's more rounded . Just {disfmarker} And more {disfmarker} It has to be {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,"Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .",User Interface
12,Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom .,Project Manager
12,"Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .",User Interface
12,"Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a {disfmarker} What the fuck is it ? {vocalsound} Okay . Mm {disfmarker} Doesn't work . {vocalsound} You see what I mean ?",Project Manager
12,{vocalsound} What ?,Industrial Designer
12,If I draw here {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It draws about four centimetres lower than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
12,Oh . Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,"Nah okay . Just {gap} . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um {disfmarker} It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .",Project Manager
12,Like a very big scroll-wheel . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .",Project Manager
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,"Maybe , I dunno .",Project Manager
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,"Okay , so we {vocalsound} have this at the moment .",Project Manager
12,I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , you {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,"Okay , so",Project Manager
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,we'd have this . Is that okay ?,Project Manager
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,"that's a little problem , of course , as well .",User Interface
12,I think it's probably better .,Industrial Designer
12,And {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,"Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh {disfmarker} That's not scrollable too easy .",User Interface
12,Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom,Project Manager
12,I think in middle .,Industrial Designer
12,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,Uh wh what is the middle part ?,User Interface
12,That's the numbers .,Project Manager
12,"Numbers , okay .",User Interface
12,"Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , I agree as well .",User Interface
12,"It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .",Project Manager
12,Use the dz,User Interface
12,"Because you already have the volume here , so {disfmarker} You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . {gap} back and forth .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , that's right .",User Interface
12,"So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well .",Project Manager
12,Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .,Industrial Designer
12,"But that's not {gap} want to zap very quick , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority .",User Interface
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah ? Is this a opportunity ,",Project Manager
12,And then you use those uh {disfmarker},User Interface
12,or you don't want a different {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,"Yeah , of course uh .",User Interface
12,"Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,Why ?,Project Manager
12,Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,But still the next {disfmarker} It's still the next one . Doesn't make {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,"Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you put them {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah . I I think it's {disfmarker} It's it's obvious , I think .",User Interface
12,"But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , that's not not {disfmarker} It's not al uh always the same .",Marketing
12,But it's exactly th,Project Manager
12,In uh {disfmarker} On most on most remote controls .,Industrial Designer
12,Every remote control's uh different .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , I think {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,"So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .",Industrial Designer
12,"I dunno . I {disfmarker} You already have the volume on the side ,",Project Manager
12,"No , uh I think {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake .,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,So it's uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,I think it's s so simple,User Interface
12,I dunno .,Industrial Designer
12,you just {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"So but that's for that's for you ,",Project Manager
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
12,'cause it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,"Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .",User Interface
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,"Okay , so hmm . What did {disfmarker} What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno .",Project Manager
12,Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?,User Interface
12,"Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .",Marketing
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .,Marketing
12,And the LED .,Project Manager
12,"No , you have uh {disfmarker} It is {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,"Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .",Industrial Designer
12,Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic .,User Interface
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,You have to look at that image of the iPod .,User Interface
12,Yes . Okay .,Marketing
12,More that uh kind of style .,User Interface
12,And a bit uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,Not not the old grey black {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Uh {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager
12,Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have {disfmarker},Marketing
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,Where you can put a ve Uh we have {disfmarker} If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .,User Interface
12,"Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
12,Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ?,Marketing
12,"Yeah , five . Let's give five .",Project Manager
12,{gap},User Interface
12,Or more or {disfmarker},Marketing
12,Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"And um uh {vocalsound} uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .",Marketing
12,Yeah . Um,User Interface
12,Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .,Marketing
12,"I think {disfmarker} Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh .",User Interface
12,"No , tha that will be {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?,Project Manager
12,Yes .,User Interface
12,"So you could put it like that ,",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , so top down .",Industrial Designer
12,okay .,Project Manager
12,Hmm ?,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .",Marketing
12,Do we have to design that w as well ?,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah . {vocalsound},Marketing
12,Uh I'm not sure .,Project Manager
12,The docking station ?,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,"But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least .",User Interface
12,"Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .",Marketing
12,"Yeah , just a recharger .",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example .",User Interface
12,But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .,Industrial Designer
12,Mm . Mm .,User Interface
12,"Yeah ,",Marketing
12,Which w,User Interface
12,but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then .,Marketing
12,Here you see one that's very round .,User Interface
12,"Oh yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
12,So I think that can be all kind of shapes .,User Interface
12,But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all .,Project Manager
12,Of the remote control ?,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Marketing
12,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Just round it up {gap} .,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod {gap} . But {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,No . Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
12,"More rounded . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's {disfmarker} This is also rounded .",User Interface
12,"No , just just the corners .",Project Manager
12,I think i,User Interface
12,{gap},Marketing
12,"Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,Okay .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh {disfmarker} As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .",Industrial Designer
12,Shapes .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new .",User Interface
12,"Not in depth . Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new .",Industrial Designer
12,I've uh {disfmarker} I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done .,User Interface
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,"It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?",Project Manager
12,Yeah . What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square .,Marketing
12,"Yeah okay , yeah well {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,Okay .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,"Yeah , it {disfmarker}",Marketing
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
12,Like in this kind of shape or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Uh it's very annoying . Okay .,Marketing
12,I dunno . I dunno if it's handy .,Industrial Designer
12,{gap} I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .,User Interface
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,This ?,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .,Industrial Designer
12,Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures {disfmarker} Oh I can show you here {vocalsound} what the old ones look like .,User Interface
12,Mm .,Industrial Designer
12,"Curves , curves .",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,You've more {gap} there as well .,User Interface
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
12,It wasn't very small one . {gap} very simple .,User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,That is for elderly .,User Interface
12,"So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I don't know .",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,Marketing
12,"I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Marketing
12,"So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .",User Interface
12,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .,User Interface
12,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,And you have the scroll button inside . {gap} Okay .,Project Manager
12,Yes . Just a simple scrollb,User Interface
12,Yeah .,Marketing
12,But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of {disfmarker} Skip that one as well .,Project Manager
12,Doesn't have to be .,User Interface
12,"Okay . Yeah , it's cool .",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,{vocalsound} Uh the t the trend is,Marketing
12,Rubber spongy .,Project Manager
12,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,spongy and fruity .,Marketing
12,Yeah . No . Spongy,User Interface
12,But yeah .,Marketing
12,Spongeball kinda .,Industrial Designer
12,and {disfmarker},User Interface
12,It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,"Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .,Project Manager
12,Mm .,User Interface
12,"Okay . Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
12,It {disfmarker} The th th,Marketing
12,I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .,Industrial Designer
12,No .,Project Manager
12,Yeah .,Marketing
12,"But I I think it's still for older people . You j still have older people . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .",Industrial Designer
12,"There is one {disfmarker} There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different {disfmarker}",Marketing
12,"Yeah , {gap} idea . But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy .,Project Manager
12,And if you make it look like the iPod {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , they're all the same .",Marketing
12,Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change,User Interface
12,Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the {vocalsound} wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .,Project Manager
12,compared to {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
12,Ye yeah . Well uh {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , we could do that .",Industrial Designer
12,Could .,User Interface
12,"Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow .",Marketing
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,"No , I think {disfmarker} Oh .",User Interface
12,It's right .,Project Manager
12,"Think the scroll wheel {vocalsound} won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much .,User Interface
12,Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has {vocalsound} if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . So maybe you have to ask her .,Project Manager
12,"Yeah okay . Well ,",User Interface
12,No .,Marketing
12,"maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .",User Interface
12,Okay . Yeah . That's probably {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,I'll be able to do a better job .,User Interface
12,"If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . Doesn't work .",Marketing
12,"{vocalsound} Okay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably . Yeah . Is that okay ?",Project Manager
12,"Yeah , I'll see it .",Marketing
12,"Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod {gap} .",User Interface
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
12,"Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,Yes .,User Interface
12,We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .,Project Manager
12,"Just a {disfmarker} Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a,Project Manager
12,S {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,Well uh,User Interface
12,advanced chip .,Project Manager
12,then it w {vocalsound},User Interface
12,"Uh yeah , I don't know . Yeah , I think so .",Industrial Designer
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
12,And we we have to build in a microphone and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,"Well that's very easy . We already have uh the beeping of the {gap} home station ,",User Interface
12,"Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that .",Industrial Designer
12,so {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition ,",Industrial Designer
12,No .,Marketing
12,Uh strange that I received {vocalsound} the information about that .,User Interface
12,so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,Oh that's hard . But {disfmarker},Marketing
12,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . We have to be original and uh technological innovative . Becau,Marketing
12,"Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,",Project Manager
12,Yeah . But {disfmarker},Marketing
12,okay ?,Project Manager
12,So,User Interface
12,{vocalsound} Ma,Marketing
12,shall we {gap} it open then ?,User Interface
12,Yeah .,Project Manager
12,So we can put all the {disfmarker},User Interface
12,The function of that in there . Yeah .,Project Manager
12,Okay .,User Interface
12,And we need a {disfmarker} Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .,Project Manager
12,"Fine . Yeah , we probably do .",Industrial Designer
12,"But it doesn't say anything about it ,",Project Manager
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,does it ?,Project Manager
12,No .,Industrial Designer
12,"Oh yeah , I {disfmarker}",User Interface
12,But we don't have any f information about the cost .,Marketing
12,No .,User Interface
12,We started with information about the cost was now th,Marketing
12,I just I just received the {disfmarker},User Interface
12,"Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip .",Industrial Designer
12,Yeah .,User Interface
12,And how much is the chip ? The the the {disfmarker},Marketing
12,"I don't know how much , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
12,"Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .",User Interface
12,Just in inexpensive or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
12,"This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .",User Interface
12,And how how does it work ? Is it {disfmarker},Marketing
12,"Doesn't say . Just {disfmarker} You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . Because uh {disfmarker} So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .",User Interface
12,It doesn't has to say anything . Just {disfmarker} You have to just talk to {disfmarker},Project Manager
12,No .,Marketing
12,Yeah uh th that's just {disfmarker} It's a {disfmarker},User Interface
12,Does it say does it say something back ?,Marketing
12,"Okay , we have to stop it now . So just {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,"No . Yeah , it {disfmarker} Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .",User Interface
12,"Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced {disfmarker}",Project Manager
12,But i it's a separate chip .,Industrial Designer
12,"I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .",User Interface
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing
12,"Yeah , I don't know anything about this ,",Industrial Designer
12,Um {disfmarker},Marketing
12,"Yeah , we just decide not to put it in ,",Project Manager
12,but {disfmarker} Nah .,Industrial Designer
12,because it's too difficult .,Project Manager
12,I dunno . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
12,Well it it would be would be a good feature feature .,User Interface

Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .",Project Manager
13,Alright .,User Interface
13,Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?,Industrial Designer
13,"There is ? Yeah , there is .",Project Manager
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound} No problem .,Project Manager
13,{vocalsound},User Interface
13,"Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . {vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .",Project Manager
13,Okay .,User Interface
13,"The market , we should have a look at the market . Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker} the the progressions , yes .",Project Manager
13,Progressions . {vocalsound},User Interface
13,"Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific {disfmarker} uh specification of that . Um {vocalsound} the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .",Project Manager
13,It's for the vision . Yeah .,User Interface
13,"Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it {disfmarker} keep it with the functional design . {vocalsound} Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . {vocalsound} Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um {vocalsound} to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . {vocalsound} Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh",Project Manager
13,Sensors .,User Interface
13,"sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um well , it {disfmarker} it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um {vocalsound} you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . {vocalsound} Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .",Project Manager
13,But we all use the same white-board file,User Interface
13,Yes .,Project Manager
13,So we can work together on it while we're {disfmarker},User Interface
13,Yeah .,Project Manager
13,or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?,User Interface
13,"Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .",Project Manager
13,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface
13,It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard .,Project Manager
13,"Yeah , alright . Yep .",User Interface
13,"Um you can choose the format , um {disfmarker} sorry . Uh {disfmarker} Let me see . Um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um {vocalsound} to um {disfmarker} oh well , I'm {disfmarker} I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training {vocalsound} um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
13,Okay . Um green .,Marketing
13,{vocalsound},User Interface
13,An animal . Okay . Um {disfmarker},Marketing
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,Uh a wee rabbit .,Marketing
13,It's a bunny . {vocalsound},User Interface

13,"But of course , Flores .",User Interface
13,{vocalsound},Marketing
13,Blank .,User Interface
13,Sebastian is thinking about the animal .,Project Manager
13,I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,Okay .,Project Manager
13,"Yeah , I'm think about it too . {vocalsound} Format {gap} . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but {vocalsound} it works ,",User Interface
13,"{vocalsound} Well , I'll give it a try . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing
13,It it should be a cat .,Project Manager
13,right ?,User Interface
13,Okay ?,Project Manager
13,{vocalsound},User Interface
13,{vocalsound} Mm .,Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound} I'm guessing a horse .,Project Manager
13,{vocalsound},User Interface
13,Very good . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,With a very small {vocalsound} legs . {vocalsound},User Interface
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
13,{vocalsound} I was very good in drawing . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,You should feed that uh that animal . {vocalsound},User Interface
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
13,"{vocalsound} Well , I guess you uh get the idea . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
13,"Yes , okay . {vocalsound} Beautiful .",Project Manager
13,Beautiful .,Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound},User Interface
13,"Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions {disfmarker} well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um {vocalsound} the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . {vocalsound} Um",Project Manager
13,{vocalsound},User Interface
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound},Marketing
13,"we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , {vocalsound} um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .",Project Manager
13,"Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh",Industrial Designer
13,Limitations .,Project Manager
13,influations influences .,Industrial Designer
13,Okay .,Project Manager
13,Okay .,User Interface
13,"Okay , great .",Project Manager
13,"Okay ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . {vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .",Industrial Designer
13,Okay .,User Interface
13,"I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .",Industrial Designer
13,And for a cell phone ?,User Interface
13,"Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .",Industrial Designer
13,"Yeah , okay . Yeah .",User Interface
13,"I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh",Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
13,is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .,Industrial Designer
13,"But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .",User Interface
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,"But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so",User Interface
13,"But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .",Industrial Designer
13,y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .,User Interface
13,So that's the point .,Industrial Designer
13,Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker},User Interface
13,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound},Marketing
13,you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .,User Interface
13,"Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,User Interface
13,"and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,Project Manager
13,but take these things into account when you start the discussion .,Industrial Designer
13,"Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,",Project Manager
13,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer
13,and {disfmarker},Project Manager
13,"so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,",Industrial Designer
13,"Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
13,and the way of communicating with these equipments .,Industrial Designer
13,"Okay . Okay , good .",Project Manager
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,"Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .",Project Manager
13,That's it .,Industrial Designer
13,Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .,Project Manager
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,"Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .",Project Manager
13,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
13,H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?,Project Manager
13,"Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?",User Interface
13,Yep .,Project Manager
13,{vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .,User Interface
13,"Yes , I think it should be something like that .",Industrial Designer
13,"It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,",User Interface
13,"Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,",Project Manager
13,right ?,User Interface
13,not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker},Project Manager
13,"Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .",User Interface
13,"We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?",Industrial Designer
13,No . No .,Project Manager
13,"No ,",Industrial Designer
13,"No , okay .",User Interface
13,"we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,Project Manager
13,Yeah .,User Interface
13,"Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?",Project Manager
13,"Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .",Marketing
13,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
13,"{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .",User Interface
13,Yeah .,Project Manager
13,So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker},User Interface
13,So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker},Project Manager
13,Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,"Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .",User Interface
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,It just should change the T_V_'s state .,User Interface
13,Okay .,Project Manager
13,So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker},User Interface
13,And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?,Industrial Designer
13,"Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .",User Interface
13,Or are there any o other controls ?,Industrial Designer
13,"Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}",User Interface
13,"Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
13,But {disfmarker},User Interface
13,"I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,User Interface
13,Uh-huh .,Project Manager
13,You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
13,They're very vu vulnerable .,User Interface
13,"w yes ,",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,User Interface
13,"to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,User Interface
13,I don't know .,Industrial Designer
13,"And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,",User Interface
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,"so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}",User Interface
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .,Project Manager
13,"Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .",User Interface
13,Okay,Project Manager
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,{disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
13,"Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .",Industrial Designer
13,"Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,",User Interface
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,"but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
13,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,"Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting",Project Manager
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,But {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,um {disfmarker},Project Manager
13,Two more things .,User Interface
13,okay .,Project Manager
13,"Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .",User Interface
13,"Okay , s yeah .",Project Manager
13,"You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .",User Interface
13,Yeah .,Project Manager
13,"And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too .",User Interface
13,Okay .,Project Manager
13,So when it's dark {disfmarker},User Interface
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
13,Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker},User Interface
13,Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha {vocalsound},Project Manager
13,Yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect . {vocalsound},User Interface
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
13,Okay .,Project Manager
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,"Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .",Project Manager
13,Do do you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
13,Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?,Project Manager
13,"Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .",Marketing
13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
13,"And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .",Marketing
13,Because ?,Project Manager
13,"Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .",Marketing
13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
13,But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that .,Marketing
13,"Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?",Project Manager
13,"Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,",Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
13,{vocalsound},User Interface
13,"but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them . Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,User Interface
13,"Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it .",Industrial Designer
13,"Yeah . Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple ,",User Interface
13,I I don't know .,Industrial Designer
13,you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .,User Interface
13,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,The uh the the digits in black .,User Interface
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy,User Interface
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
13,"{disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course .",User Interface
13,Okay .,Project Manager
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,"Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So {disfmarker}",Project Manager
13,"Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .",Industrial Designer
13,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
13,"Well , that's more {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
13,"twelve Euro fifty , yeah .",Project Manager
13,Yeah .,Marketing
13,"So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .",Industrial Designer
13,Okay .,Project Manager
13,The cost price is very low .,Industrial Designer
13,Just remind something .,User Interface
13,Um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
13,The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .,User Interface
13,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager
13,You have a m uh {disfmarker},User Interface
13,Okay . Very good point . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
13,"Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .",User Interface
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,"Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily",Project Manager
13,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .,Project Manager
13,Yeah .,User Interface
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker},Project Manager
13,"But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah .",User Interface
13,"yeah . I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
13,Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .,User Interface
13,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
13,'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker},User Interface
13,{vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
13,Well does it ?,Project Manager
13,"Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .",User Interface
13,well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
13,I'm not sure . Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
13,"Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay .",Industrial Designer
13,Yeah .,Project Manager
13,So uh technically it will be possible .,Industrial Designer
13,"But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .",User Interface
13,"Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .",Project Manager
13,Does it {disfmarker},User Interface
13,"No , you cannot .",Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound} It's over ?,User Interface
13,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,{vocalsound},Marketing
13,Um,Project Manager
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
13,"{vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it .",Project Manager
13,Okay .,User Interface
13,See you in thirty minutes .,Project Manager
13,Great .,User Interface
14,Welcome back .,Project Manager
14,Hello .,User Interface
14,Hello .,Marketing
14,Uh let me see .,Project Manager
14,There's one of mine .,User Interface
14,"Okay . Roo , welcome back .",Project Manager
14,"Hello , Flores .",User Interface
14,The waiting is for Sebastian .,Project Manager
14,{gap} .,User Interface
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,There he is .,Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer
14,We have a slight problem . {vocalsound} I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .,User Interface
14,Sorry ?,Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Can I get a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer
14,"Uh no . You can't ,",Project Manager
14,Okay . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,sorry .,Project Manager
14,So just cancel it .,User Interface
14,"{gap} Well , during my work I have no time either .",Industrial Designer
14,"{vocalsound} Well ,",Project Manager
14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,"this is life . {vocalsound} Sorry uh , Roo .",Project Manager
14,"Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . {vocalsound} Accidentally .",User Interface
14,"Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .",Project Manager
14,But it's alright .,User Interface
14,"{vocalsound} Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it .",Project Manager
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
14,"Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?",Project Manager
14,I think so too .,Industrial Designer
14,Roo ?,Project Manager
14,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
14,Ruud ?,Project Manager
14,Almost . {vocalsound},Marketing
14,"Almost , okay .",Project Manager
14,{vocalsound},User Interface
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m,Project Manager
14,"But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .",User Interface
14,{vocalsound} Um we will figure that out . Ca {vocalsound} can you try to {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,Okay .,User Interface
14,Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the {gap} .,Marketing
14,"Yeah , w we will see .",Project Manager
14,I don't think it's wireless here .,User Interface
14,"Um {disfmarker} it is , yeah . Yeah .",Project Manager
14,It is .,Industrial Designer
14,Or it is . Yeah ?,User Interface
14,It is .,Industrial Designer
14,"Okay , great .",User Interface
14,Uh okay .,Marketing
14,"Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um {vocalsound} we have forty minutes . So it's now {disfmarker} Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . {vocalsound} It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,uh uh {disfmarker} we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .,Project Manager
14,"Time , yeah .",User Interface
14,"Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , {vocalsound} which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um {vocalsound} then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .",Project Manager
14,Yes .,User Interface
14,"Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?",Project Manager
14,"Yeah , I'll start .",User Interface
14,"Uh uh yeah . Okay ,",Project Manager
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
14,great .,Project Manager
14,"Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .",User Interface
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager
14,Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .,User Interface
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,"Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .",User Interface
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
14,And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .,User Interface
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,"{vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .",User Interface
14,Uh-huh .,Project Manager
14,"So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .",User Interface
14,"Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"Yeah , uh b uh most .",Marketing
14,"Okay , so",Project Manager
14,{vocalsound},Marketing
14,the important thing here is {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .,User Interface
14,"Oh , user-friendly .",Marketing
14,"In the market , yeah .",Project Manager
14,"Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .",User Interface
14,"Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .,User Interface
14,Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .,Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound},User Interface
14,"Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .",Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound},User Interface
14,"Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,",Industrial Designer
14,Energies and uh {disfmarker},User Interface
14,but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?,Industrial Designer
14,"No , it's not visible .",Project Manager
14,"No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w",Industrial Designer
14,The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .,User Interface
14,yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
14,"Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .",Industrial Designer
14,So it's fairly easy .,Project Manager
14,"There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,",Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Succeed in it also .,User Interface
14,and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .,Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound},Marketing
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager
14,"So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh",Industrial Designer
14,good .,Project Manager
14,"personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear .",Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .",Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .",Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker},User Interface
14,I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .,Industrial Designer
14,"if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}",User Interface
14,"No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .",Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,User Interface
14,So we can use them . So that's no problem .,Industrial Designer
14,"For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker}",User Interface
14,"Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
14,Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker},User Interface
14,We can we can make its I think .,Industrial Designer
14,"Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .",Marketing
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .",Project Manager
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer
14,But I think {disfmarker},User Interface
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,",User Interface
14,"Hmm , true . {vocalsound}",Marketing
14,and not for {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"Yes . Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .",Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .",User Interface
14,"No no no , no . That's right , that's right .",Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it .",Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Um have a think about it .,Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah . Okay , Ruud .",Project Manager
14,"Oh , mine is already outdated .",Marketing
14,"Okay well ,",Project Manager
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .,Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker},Marketing
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,So any income is welcome . {vocalsound} Input .,Project Manager
14,"Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .",Marketing
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"Could you step a little bit more to the right ? {vocalsound} Yeah , thank you . {vocalsound}",User Interface
14,"But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .",Marketing
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,"Uh well , skip this . {vocalsound}",Marketing
14,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,"Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .",Marketing
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer
14,So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .,Marketing
14,"Okay . Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing
14,"Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function ,",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
14,you know .,Industrial Designer
14,that's definitely interesting .,Project Manager
14,That's quite a {disfmarker} yes .,Industrial Designer
14,It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .,Project Manager
14,Sound signal .,User Interface
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,go on .,Project Manager
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
14,"Well , I just said that . And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it .",Marketing
14,Okay . So that's what the market tells us .,Project Manager
14,"Uh that's about it , yes .",Marketing
14,Yep . Okay .,Project Manager
14,The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .,User Interface
14,Uh mo uh zap buttons most .,Marketing
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So {disfmarker}",Marketing
14,"Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons . And first um {disfmarker}",User Interface
14,"Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,Yep .,Project Manager
14,"Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .",Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?",User Interface
14,Well,Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem . Yeah . {vocalsound}",Marketing
14,Yes . {vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem .,Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .,User Interface
14,Well,Project Manager
14,Usually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,"maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",Project Manager
14,It should be uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface
14,like um turning on and off the the the lights .,Project Manager
14,Oh yes .,Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .",User Interface
14,"Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .",Industrial Designer
14,Reports rep respend response to it .,Project Manager
14,And um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,"just like uh the phones Yeah ,",User Interface
14,"Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .",Industrial Designer
14,the {disfmarker},User Interface
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,But uh th,Project Manager
14,But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"No , so we we should use something else .",Industrial Designer
14,And you {disfmarker},Marketing
14,"Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,But I believe you will have an {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"Yeah , and usually {disfmarker}",Marketing
14,We do not control the T_V_ set so well .,Industrial Designer
14,"And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,",Marketing
14,"Yes , m yes . S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers ,",Industrial Designer
14,and it's {disfmarker},Marketing
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,so we should think about {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se,Project Manager
14,I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .,User Interface
14,"{vocalsound} It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .",Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound} And b,Marketing
14,"Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,"Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,",Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , a peak . Yeah .",Project Manager
14,which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .,Industrial Designer
14,"So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .",Marketing
14,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager
14,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer
14,But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .,User Interface
14,so we don't want that .,Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound},Marketing
14,Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that .,Industrial Designer
14,Well if you lost th,User Interface
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer
14,Well uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .,User Interface
14,"Well , I don't think uh {gap} .",Industrial Designer
14,Uh that's just uh {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,"so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .",Industrial Designer
14,{gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .,User Interface
14,"Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .",Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .",Project Manager
14,So that's not a good idea .,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,"Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,",Project Manager
14,Mm-hmm . I will .,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .,Project Manager
14,Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated,Industrial Designer
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
14,um and it will become more costly also .,Industrial Designer
14,Yep .,Project Manager
14,Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp,Industrial Designer
14,"And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?",User Interface
14,"Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .",Industrial Designer
14,It's a unique item uh {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .",Project Manager
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .,User Interface
14,"It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .,Project Manager
14,"And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .",User Interface
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,What should we choose in in design ?,User Interface
14,"Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .",Project Manager
14,"Well , the extra functions .",User Interface
14,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .,Marketing
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .",Marketing
14,Used option .,User Interface
14,Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,"Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
14,{vocalsound},Marketing
14,{vocalsound},User Interface
14,"Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .",Marketing
14,"Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .",Project Manager
14,So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .,Marketing
14,"Well , we skip that .",Project Manager
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .",User Interface
14,"No , no .",Industrial Designer
14,No .,Project Manager
14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
14,Nope .,Marketing
14,So that's out of the question .,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .,User Interface
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .,Project Manager
14,"I think also . Yes . Well ,",Industrial Designer
14,No .,Project Manager
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface
14,we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface,Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah . Okay ,",Project Manager
14,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,"Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,"Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might ,",Marketing
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
14,'cause young people uh like new features .,Marketing
14,Mm yeah .,Project Manager
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing
14,"Yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer
14,"Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer
14,"Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .",User Interface
14,"Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,"Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
14,"But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh",Project Manager
14,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .",Industrial Designer
14,But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?,Project Manager
14,"Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound}",User Interface
14,Because we do not implement uh a user history .,Project Manager
14,"Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .",Industrial Designer
14,"I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,"W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .",Industrial Designer
14,"And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .",Marketing
14,Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .,Project Manager
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
14,"But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,",User Interface
14,"Yeah , draw draw it on the board .",Project Manager
14,"should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh .",User Interface
14,"yeah , something like that . Oh",Industrial Designer
14,It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .,User Interface
14,"It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes .",Industrial Designer
14,A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down,User Interface
14,"Yeah , it can break down .",Project Manager
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
14,or uh,User Interface
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer
14,"just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .",User Interface
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,"And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .",Industrial Designer
14,A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh .,Marketing
14,But you're the marketing man .,Industrial Designer
14,"And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .",Marketing
14,"Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound}",User Interface
14,Uh-huh . {vocalsound},Project Manager
14,The programme up and down . {vocalsound},User Interface
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound},Marketing
14,"Okay , yeah .",Project Manager
14,"And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .",User Interface
14,"Okay , that's good .",Industrial Designer
14,"Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .",Project Manager
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
14,"But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think .",User Interface
14,"Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah .",Project Manager
14,Yes ?,User Interface
14,We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience .,Project Manager
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
14,"but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay ,",User Interface
14,Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?,Industrial Designer
14,"Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .",Project Manager
14,Okay . Okay .,Industrial Designer
14,The ten digits .,User Interface
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
14,"Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,"Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change",User Interface
14,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah . A bit of a split mode .,Project Manager
14,Change .,Industrial Designer
14,Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager
14,{disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer
14,Dual channel watch .,Project Manager
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
14,"Okay , well um",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound},Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,{vocalsound},User Interface
14,you're the secretary . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,"Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?",Project Manager
14,Mielsen .,Marketing
14,"Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,"Mm okay ,",Industrial Designer
14,Alright .,User Interface
14,"but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,"if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker},User Interface
14,{vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,"Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,{vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker},User Interface
14,Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,"Yes , that's important .",Industrial Designer
14,And and do we want um the ten digits ?,Project Manager
14,"The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .",User Interface
14,"Well , are are you sure ?",Industrial Designer
14,"Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .",Marketing
14,I'm not so sure .,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"Well , that's complicated ,",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so .,Industrial Designer
14,I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits .,User Interface
14,"Okay ,",Industrial Designer
14,Uh and I think the most {disfmarker},User Interface
14,I can imagine when,Industrial Designer
14,I agree actually . {vocalsound},Project Manager
14,"Just elder elder people would would buy it ,",User Interface
14,"I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .",Industrial Designer
14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing
14,but {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .",Industrial Designer
14,But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .,Project Manager
14,But {disfmarker},Marketing
14,Yep . The older people only use five of them .,User Interface
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah ,",Marketing
14,but how how often do you watch all these channels ?,Industrial Designer
14,"and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .",Marketing
14,Often .,Project Manager
14,"No , you're probably right .",Industrial Designer
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?,Industrial Designer
14,"Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,The design .,Industrial Designer
14,On the design .,User Interface
14,"Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it .",Industrial Designer
14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing
14,You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy,Project Manager
14,And {disfmarker},Marketing
14,"by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .",Project Manager
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
14,So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .",Industrial Designer
14,"Exactly , exactly .",Project Manager
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer
14,"And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker}",Marketing
14,"Okay , speech .",Project Manager
14,"Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .,Industrial Designer
14,To find {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
14,"So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits,Project Manager
14,But maybe when we uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,"but keep the programme and the volume ,",Project Manager
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
14,"because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,"Okay . Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer
14,Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but,Marketing
14,Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .,Project Manager
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer
14,Yes .,Marketing
14,"Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .",Industrial Designer
14,So,User Interface
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .,User Interface
14,"Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function .",Industrial Designer
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"So that's that's a big advantage , I think .",Industrial Designer
14,"Okay , g good .",Project Manager
14,{vocalsound},User Interface
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .,Industrial Designer
14,Mm .,Project Manager
14,But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it .,Industrial Designer
14,Yep .,Project Manager
14,There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .,Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .",Industrial Designer
14,But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?,Project Manager
14,You have to do nothing for it .,Industrial Designer
14,M {vocalsound},Marketing
14,{vocalsound} Twelve dollar fifty . {vocalsound},User Interface
14,Because it seems like a very {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
14,"{vocalsound} Maybe , maybe not .",Industrial Designer
14,"And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .",Marketing
14,"I'll have to find that out . Yes . So {disfmarker} No , that's very cheap .",Industrial Designer
14,'Cause when {disfmarker},Marketing
14,Is a cradle very cheap ?,Project Manager
14,"It's {disfmarker} Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .",Industrial Designer
14,"I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .",Project Manager
14,"It's {disfmarker} Yes , but they're they're mass production .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,They're very cheap .,Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,So it will cost us p practically nothing .,Industrial Designer
14,"Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um {vocalsound} I would like to hear um {disfmarker} maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?",Project Manager
14,Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .,Marketing
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,"But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So {disfmarker} I don't think that's a big problem",Marketing
14,"Okay . Okay , so",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
14,"although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh {disfmarker} Profitable . We we {disfmarker} yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",Project Manager
14,"Yes . Yeah , profitable .",Marketing
14,Profitable .,Industrial Designer
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,Yes .,Marketing
14,O okay . {vocalsound} Um Roo . {gap} {disfmarker} Nothing to add .,Project Manager
14,"I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .",User Interface
14,Sebastian ?,Project Manager
14,Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah ? Great .,Project Manager
14,"so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that {disfmarker} these kinds of things .",Industrial Designer
14,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,Project Manager
14,"Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .",Industrial Designer
14,Yep .,Project Manager
14,"Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not {disfmarker} do not implement these buttons . {vocalsound} If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,"well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .",Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,Project Manager
14,And this even uh makes it more cheapy .,Industrial Designer
14,But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?,User Interface
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
14,The board .,Project Manager
14,The circuit board .,User Interface
14,The circuit board .,Industrial Designer
14,The fewer buttons you can use on it .,User Interface
14,"No , it's th",Project Manager
14,"The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .",Industrial Designer
14,yeah .,Project Manager
14,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface
14,"It's the other way around , yeah .",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,"And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage .",Industrial Designer
14,It shouldn't be a big issue .,Project Manager
14,Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition .,User Interface
14,"So {disfmarker} Yes , because I don't know {disfmarker} Yes . I d I really don't know . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
14,No .,User Interface
14,Okay .,Project Manager
14,It can be costly . Maybe not .,Industrial Designer
14,"I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that .",Project Manager
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
14,Um I'm not sure how how that {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,"Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh {vocalsound} have a lo uh look at it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
14,Yep .,Project Manager
14,{vocalsound},User Interface
14,"Okay , great . Um {vocalsound} well , I think we're qui quite done .",Project Manager
14,"We're done , I think .",User Interface
14,Um for now we will have the lunch break .,Project Manager
14,How nice .,Industrial Designer
14,"Um I'm {disfmarker} don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out .",Project Manager
14,Me neither .,User Interface
14,"Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um {vocalsound} the Interface Designer , um I would like to {disfmarker} the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .",Project Manager
14,Interface {disfmarker} industrial .,User Interface
14,"Uh {disfmarker} I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry .",Project Manager
14,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
14,"User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept .",Project Manager
14,"Well , we understand . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
14,And um,Project Manager
14,Uh the only problem is it {disfmarker} that it depends on the divisions {disfmarker} the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition .,User Interface
14,Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
14,"Well , i it should be easy ,",Project Manager
14,Well {disfmarker},User Interface
14,"that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um {vocalsound} um yeah , some some fancy lights .",Project Manager
14,Mm yes .,Industrial Designer
14,Yeah .,User Interface
14,I think that's what we decided .,Project Manager
14,So we drop the voice recognition ?,Industrial Designer
14,"No no no , we didn't {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,Or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,but it shouldn't be integrated {disfmarker},Project Manager
14,Oh .,Industrial Designer
14,"yeah , it's {disfmarker} of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
14,Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now,Industrial Designer
14,No .,Project Manager
14,or can we decide next meeting ?,Industrial Designer
14,We can decide the next meeting . Yep .,Project Manager
14,Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
14,Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching .,Project Manager
14,Yep .,User Interface
14,"And I'm sure the market will um uh {vocalsound} {gap} uh will change , adapt",Project Manager
14,Hmm .,Marketing
14,Adapt .,User Interface
14,Adapt .,Industrial Designer
14,Left .,Marketing
14,and um so,Project Manager
14,Hmm .,Marketing
14,"we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now .",Project Manager
14,That's it .,User Interface
14,Any other questions,Project Manager
14,'Kay .,User Interface
14,or can we have the lunch ?,Project Manager
14,We can have the lunch .,Industrial Designer
14,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
14,Yeah .,Marketing
14,I'll take the lunch .,User Interface
14,Good .,Project Manager
15,If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .,Project Manager
15,Hmm .,User Interface
15,Is that someone's ?,Marketing
15,Is that {gap} .,Project Manager
15,Thank you .,User Interface
15,"{gap} three , apparently .",Project Manager
15,Hmm . Hmm .,User Interface
15,"Okay , you all switched on .",Project Manager
15,Okay .,Marketing
15,"Yep , me too .",User Interface
15,"I presume we're good to go . Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,",Project Manager
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
15,"standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um {vocalsound} and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um {vocalsound} and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ? Prototype presentation .",Project Manager
15,Is that {gap} for us ?,Industrial Designer
15,Yep .,User Interface
15,I think that would be you .,Project Manager
15,Okay .,Industrial Designer
15,"Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .",User Interface
15,"Yeah , shall I show ?",Industrial Designer
15,Yeah .,User Interface
15,I'll show . Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it,Industrial Designer
15,I can hold it like {disfmarker},User Interface
15,Make sure the camera's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
15,"Yeah ,",User Interface
15,and I'll I'll show you the presentation .,Industrial Designer
15,so {disfmarker},User Interface
15,Can I just nick your {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
15,"Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out .",Project Manager
15,{gap},User Interface
15,Whoa .,Industrial Designer
15,It looks,User Interface
15,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
15,Going a bit crazy over here .,Industrial Designer
15,crazy {gap} .,User Interface
15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,Thank you .,Industrial Designer
15,Um not now . Oh .,User Interface
15,{vocalsound} You should have one of those things and you can just take it off .,Project Manager
15,Yeah .,User Interface
15,Ta-da .,Project Manager
15,"Oh , where are the hinges ? {vocalsound}",User Interface
15,{vocalsound},Project Manager
15,"Okay , so",Industrial Designer
15,Right .,Project Manager
15,"this is our look and feel presentation , the final {disfmarker} our final presentation .",Industrial Designer
15,Mm 'kay .,Project Manager
15,And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um,Industrial Designer
15,'Kay . You able to look {gap} ?,User Interface
15,"It's gonna have a a plastic body {vocalsound} um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .",Industrial Designer
15,Yep . {gap},User Interface
15,This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing,Industrial Designer
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
15,"um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker} they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .",Industrial Designer
15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,"Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
15,{vocalsound} {gap} .,User Interface
15,"and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top",Industrial Designer
15,The black and white touch screen wherein people can {disfmarker},User Interface
15,Mm . So it's flush .,Project Manager
15,and the buttons at the bottom would d,Industrial Designer
15,Right .,User Interface
15,so so it'll fully close flat .,Industrial Designer
15,"Oh right , okay , yeah .",Project Manager
15,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
15,{gap} {gap},User Interface
15,"{vocalsound} And working on the inside we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries , which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
15,"So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,",Project Manager
15,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
15,'cause it's the top part that's {disfmarker} okay .,Project Manager
15,"Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound} and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .",Industrial Designer
15,{vocalsound} Or something . {vocalsound},Marketing
15,{vocalsound},User Interface
15,"{vocalsound} And then {disfmarker} yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .",Industrial Designer
15,{vocalsound},Marketing
15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,'Kay .,User Interface
15,I'm under the sofa .,Project Manager
15,Ah oka,User Interface
15,"Or , that would be too complicated .",Project Manager
15,"Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .",Industrial Designer
15,Infrared {gap} .,Project Manager
15,"Um it would it would have {disfmarker} obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . {vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker} we haven't {disfmarker} I don't think we actually put it on .",Industrial Designer
15,Like here .,Project Manager
15,"Yeah , yeah , something like that .",Industrial Designer
15,"Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here .",User Interface
15,"Okay . Actually , no , it would be {disfmarker} it would have to be on the on the front .",Project Manager
15,"Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .",Industrial Designer
15,"{gap} . So when it's {disfmarker} even if it's open here , the signals would go {gap} .",User Interface
15,"Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing ,",Project Manager
15,"So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer
15,yes .,Project Manager
15,Yeah .,User Interface
15,"Yeah , that would make sense .",Project Manager
15,"And then finally um on to the interface . {vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen",Industrial Designer
15,{gap} This one right here .,User Interface
15,"which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .",Industrial Designer
15,{gap} .,User Interface
15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,"And now we've {disfmarker} we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .",Industrial Designer
15,Which is {disfmarker},User Interface
15,But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product,Project Manager
15,"No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing .",Industrial Designer
15,No .,User Interface
15,once it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
15,Look up to it .,User Interface
15,Okay .,Project Manager

15,Yay .,User Interface
15,"Wrapping it all up , okay .",Project Manager
15,Well done .,Marketing
15,Um I've now got evaluation criteria .,Project Manager
15,Certainly .,Marketing
15,So this is the one . Sorry .,User Interface
15,It's to be presented {gap} .,Project Manager
15,There you go . {gap} .,Industrial Designer
15,Logged in ? Thank you . Oops .,Marketing
15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,Evaluation . {gap} .,User Interface
15,{vocalsound},Project Manager
15,Mm um I I think this is {gap} chip .,User Interface
15,"It's quite similar to what it was before , though .",Project Manager
15,Okay .,Marketing
15,Sorry .,Project Manager
15,"This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .",Marketing
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
15,"{vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up ,",Marketing
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .,Marketing
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
15,Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ?,Marketing
15,"Ah , it's perfect .",User Interface
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
15,we're going to look at these crite So,Marketing

15,"Yes ,",Marketing
15,okay .,User Interface
15,{gap},Industrial Designer
15,we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one,Marketing
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager

15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,Is that okay ?,Marketing
15,'Kay .,User Interface
15,"One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . {vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . {vocalsound}",Marketing
15,{vocalsound} Just write small .,Project Manager
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
15,"Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ?",Marketing
15,"Yeah , so you can {disfmarker}",User Interface
15,Yeah . That works .,Project Manager
15,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
15,"Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .",Marketing
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy {disfmarker} it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false .",Marketing
15,{vocalsound} I would agree .,Project Manager
15,"Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh {vocalsound} two {disfmarker} yeah ,",Industrial Designer
15,I'll just go this way .,Marketing
15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,'Kay .,User Interface
15,two or three .,Industrial Designer
15,Two .,Marketing
15,"No , three . Three .",Industrial Designer
15,Okay .,Marketing
15,I would say two .,Project Manager
15,Two .,Marketing
15,{vocalsound} I would say four .,User Interface

15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
15,"Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right .",Marketing
15,Almost three .,User Interface
15,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,Two and three quarters ?,Marketing
15,I think yeah .,User Interface
15,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
15,"Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . {vocalsound} Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three .",Marketing
15,I'd give it a one .,Industrial Designer
15,Okay . Not that you're biased {vocalsound} in that it {disfmarker} the designer .,Marketing
15,"No , no , not at all .",Industrial Designer
15,A two .,Project Manager
15,"Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first .",User Interface
15,The average {disfmarker},Marketing
15,"Yeah , I I just {gap} it the other way .",User Interface
15,"oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ?",Marketing
15,"Uh in {gap} Yep , I just got {disfmarker}",User Interface
15,Okay .,Marketing
15,{gap},User Interface
15,"So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay ,",Marketing
15,two point f,User Interface
15,and we're just waiting for your rating,Marketing
15,It's just two point five for that one .,Project Manager
15,f,Marketing
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay .",Marketing
15,"One is a {gap} , seven is false , okay .",User Interface
15,"So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?",Marketing
15,Two .,User Interface
15,"Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two ,",Marketing
15,Two .,Industrial Designer
15,"nice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .",Marketing
15,Two .,Industrial Designer
15,Two .,Marketing
15,I would say a two . I would say a two .,Project Manager

15,{vocalsound},User Interface
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
15,"{vocalsound} We'll just put almost two ,",Marketing
15,One point seven f five .,Project Manager
15,because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .,Marketing
15,"Okay , mm-hmm .",Project Manager
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"Okay . Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at",Marketing
15,D_ .,Industrial Designer
15,"it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .",Marketing
15,One . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .",Marketing
15,"Yeah , that's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
15,Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?,Marketing
15,"No , no , the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,",Industrial Designer
15,White . With {disfmarker} for the plastic ? Uh blue .,User Interface
15,but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .,Industrial Designer
15,Right .,Marketing
15,Any {disfmarker},User Interface
15,So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .,Marketing
15,Right .,User Interface
15,"Yeah , yeah , yeah",Industrial Designer
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
15,Okay .,Marketing
15,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
15,And the spongy feel is no problem with that .,Marketing
15,"Yeah , because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case .",User Interface
15,"No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .",Industrial Designer
15,Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me .,Marketing
15,"Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .",Industrial Designer
15,Yep .,Marketing
15,One .,Project Manager
15,Everybody ? Okay .,Marketing
15,One .,User Interface
15,{vocalsound} That part was nice and easy .,Marketing
15,Mm .,User Interface
15,Yeah . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
15,Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .,Marketing
15,Mm .,Industrial Designer
15,I don't think we've really touched on that a lot .,Marketing
15,No .,Industrial Designer
15,"We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .

15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_",Project Manager
15,It's meant to be .,Industrial Designer
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
15,it's meant to . Um,Project Manager
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
15,maybe because it's slightl,Project Manager
15,{gap},Industrial Designer
15,"with the size that we've got it's quite small ,",Project Manager
15,{gap},Industrial Designer
15,but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .,Project Manager
15,Mm .,Marketing
15,"So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .",Project Manager
15,Mm-hmm . Right .,Marketing
15,It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
15,Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .,Marketing
15,"Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually ,",Industrial Designer
15,"A five , okay .",Marketing
15,'cause {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
15,Four .,Project Manager
15,Four and a four okay .,Marketing
15,Four .,User Interface
15,Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one ?,Marketing
15,{gap},User Interface
15,So that's four point two five .,Marketing
15,Yep .,Industrial Designer
15,"And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really {disfmarker}",Marketing
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?,Marketing
15,"Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition ,",Industrial Designer
15,Voice r recognition .,User Interface
15,"It was the I'm here thing ,",Marketing
15,yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .",Marketing
15,"Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible .",Industrial Designer
15,"That sounds good then . I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .",Marketing
15,Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand,Industrial Designer
15,A standard .,Project Manager

The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?",Marketing
15,I don't think so .,Project Manager
15,"W I thin yeah , I think {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
15,We happy to go ahead ?,Marketing
15,I think we {disfmarker} yeah . I think we're set .,Project Manager
15,yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .",Marketing

15,Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's {disfmarker} that's minus three .,Project Manager
15,"They {vocalsound} n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two .",Industrial Designer
15,"Oh , right . I keep seeing zero . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We can do it some other way ,",Project Manager
15,{gap},User Interface
15,"we can do {disfmarker} it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .",Project Manager
15,Yeah .,Marketing
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
15,You could choose to have that or not .,Project Manager

15,{vocalsound} Make it costly .,User Interface
15,"We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as {disfmarker} this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we {disfmarker} the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .",Marketing

15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
15,"Yeah , we could say {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
15,"And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers",Marketing
15,"Okay , we can make the price fit ,",Project Manager
15,"Yeah , I s",Industrial Designer
15,"and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this ,",Project Manager
15,And then say we recommend {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
15,Mm .,Marketing
15,because it also sets it apart from the crowd .,Project Manager

15,It's {vocalsound} s something completely different associated with your company .,Project Manager
15,Yeah .,Marketing
15,"Right , okay , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
15,So if we take voice recognition out {disfmarker},Marketing
15,That'll do it . Twelve point three five .,Industrial Designer
15,Yeah we are close to the budget .,User Interface
15,{gap} we are .,Marketing
15,Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?,Industrial Designer
15,Two five .,User Interface

15,isn't it ?,Project Manager

15,is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ?,Project Manager
15,Yeah . No .,Industrial Designer
15,Okay .,Project Manager
15,"'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah .",Industrial Designer
15,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
15,Seems fine .,User Interface
15,"Yeah , I think that's brilliant .",Industrial Designer

15,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
15,Yeah .,Project Manager
15,"I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually {disfmarker} if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different ,",Industrial Designer
15,Yeah .,Project Manager
15,but {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down ,",Project Manager
15,Yeah .,User Interface
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . I like that . Um",Project Manager
15,Mm .,Industrial Designer

15,Had time to kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
15,Mm .,Marketing
15,"Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it ,",Project Manager
15,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer

15,Yeah .,Marketing
15,like uh we spent times individually . I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . {vocalsound},User Interface
15,"Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general ,",Project Manager
15,"It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in ,",Marketing

15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"it so it's {disfmarker} I mean nothing is new ,",Marketing

15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
15,but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it .,Project Manager
15,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit .",Industrial Designer
15,Yeah .,Marketing
15,Mm .,Project Manager
15,"Uh d they don't really think about it ,",Industrial Designer
15,Yeah .,Marketing
15,"because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer
15,"Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah .",Marketing
15,"But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go ,",Project Manager

15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being {disfmarker} a plastic was being made for you .",Project Manager

15,But people could {gap} have anything that they wanted .,Project Manager
15,Mm .,Industrial Designer
15,"Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .",User Interface
15,Because of the produ Mm .,Project Manager

15,"I think it's really good that this has been very market research based ,",Marketing
15,Right .,User Interface
15,"because {vocalsound} just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .

15,Yes .,Project Manager
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,"{vocalsound} I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore",Marketing

15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
15,"Um {vocalsound} our costs are below budget with recommendations that they {disfmarker} the budget be increased , but I think {disfmarker} I don't know , d what do you think ?

15,{vocalsound},User Interface
15,{vocalsound} Well .,Industrial Designer
15,I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .,Marketing

15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
15,"So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at .",Project Manager
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
15,Maybe fifty percent more .,User Interface
15,But I think {disfmarker} but you were saying that that's quite {disfmarker},Project Manager
15,"Yeah , I think {disfmarker} yeah I don't {disfmarker} from the market research .",Industrial Designer
15,"But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do ,",Marketing
15,Hmm .,Project Manager
15,and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .,Marketing
15,Yeah .,Project Manager
15,"No . Yeah , it was {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
15,I think we've done very well to get within budget,Marketing

16,No .,Marketing
16,"Yeah , that's right ,",User Interface
16,But it's just {disfmarker},Project Manager
16,it {disfmarker} but you actually got to write on the paper .,User Interface
16,Sorry ?,Project Manager
16,You really got to write on that paper .,User Interface
16,"Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word ,",Project Manager
16,"Yeah yeah , it's a real pen .",Marketing
16,so that's not,Project Manager
16,"Yeah , but it's just a picture .",User Interface
16,just {disfmarker} it's just a picture . So {vocalsound},Project Manager
16,Oh .,Marketing
16,it's not that cool as I th thought it would be .,Project Manager
16,You really {disfmarker},User Interface

16,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing
16,{vocalsound} Oh,Project Manager
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
16,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing
16,this is definitely the best one .,Project Manager
16,{vocalsound},User Interface
16,Uh .,Industrial Designer
16,"Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Okay ,",Project Manager
16,Excuse me .,Industrial Designer
16,"that's {gap} . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,",Project Manager
16,Piece of cake .,User Interface
16,sorry .,Project Manager
16,Uh easy .,User Interface
16,"So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have {gap} a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the {gap} and everything , so just have a look how it {disfmarker} we think about remote controls .",Project Manager
16,"Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a {vocalsound} a universal remote control ?",Marketing
16,"Oh yeah , that's a good question .",Project Manager
16,"Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .",Marketing
16,"I think it's {disfmarker} I'm not I'm not sure ,",Project Manager
16,So I {disfmarker},Marketing
16,it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker},Project Manager
16,"Yeah , it probably would be universal .",Industrial Designer
16,Universal .,User Interface
16,Because {disfmarker} {gap},Marketing
16,And only television ? Or more devices ?,User Interface
16,"I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so {disfmarker} not sure , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager
16,"Hmm , maybe , I don't know .",Industrial Designer
16,"Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros",Marketing
16,"Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect .",Project Manager
16,Ah okay .,User Interface
16,"Yeah , I think .",Marketing
16,And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player,Industrial Designer
16,"Yeah , everything",Project Manager
16,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
16,just {disfmarker} so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control .,Project Manager
16,"okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , probably .",Industrial Designer
16,Not just a T_V_ .,User Interface
16,"No , just everything .",Project Manager
16,Okay .,User Interface
16,"{gap} . so yeah ,",Project Manager
16,Okay .,Marketing
16,"what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not {disfmarker} nothing very special , but um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
16,Well we can try to make it special .,User Interface
16,"yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
16,{vocalsound},Marketing
16,So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound},Project Manager
16,Well {disfmarker},User Interface
16,"Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , {gap} {disfmarker} we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . {vocalsound} Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh {vocalsound} use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .",Marketing
16,Hmm yeah .,Project Manager
16,{vocalsound},User Interface
16,That's right . Should be a good point .,Project Manager
16,Yeah .,User Interface
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer
16,Nothing {gap} N,User Interface
16,And how big should it be ?,Industrial Designer
16,No . Yeah .,Marketing
16,"{gap} It shouldn't be too big ,",User Interface
16,I dunno um {disfmarker},Marketing
16,"but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .",User Interface
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .,User Interface
16,"Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .",Project Manager
16,Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .,User Interface
16,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,",User Interface
16,Yes,Marketing
16,maybe more trendy .,User Interface
16,But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open .,Project Manager
16,"Fold open ,",User Interface
16,"Okay ,",Project Manager
16,where you can see uh more options . I think {disfmarker},User Interface
16,"yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something ,",Project Manager
16,Yeah,Industrial Designer
16,Ah,Marketing
16,n,Industrial Designer
16,that's that's {disfmarker},Marketing
16,if you just {disfmarker},Project Manager
16,"Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .",User Interface
16,Ah right right .,Marketing
16,"Yeah , or you c",Industrial Designer
16,Yeah .,Project Manager
16,O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .,Industrial Designer
16,"Oh that's good , yeah .",Marketing
16,Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker},User Interface
16,Yeah .,Marketing
16,Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?,Project Manager
16,{vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
16,There are buttons on it .,Project Manager
16,No you can make an uh manual in it .,User Interface
16,"Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .",Industrial Designer
16,Okay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .,Project Manager
16,But that's {disfmarker},User Interface
16,Uh like a a to have {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
16,"Yeah , but",Marketing
16,"Yeah , I think it's much uh {disfmarker} too expensive .",User Interface
16,"Yeah , maybe it would .",Industrial Designer
16,"Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .",Marketing
16,{gap},Project Manager
16,"And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,",Marketing
16,Yeah .,Project Manager
16,because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .,Marketing
16,"Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .",Project Manager
16,"Yeah , too fragile .",User Interface
16,Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker},Marketing
16,No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound},Project Manager
16,Kid-proof .,Industrial Designer
16,{vocalsound},Marketing
16,{vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .,User Interface
16,{vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?,Industrial Designer
16,Um {disfmarker},Marketing
16,Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
16,"Oh maybe that's a good idea ,",Project Manager
16,Ma maybe a home station .,Marketing
16,"just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,",Project Manager
16,Yeah .,User Interface
16,you never have to use any batteries .,Project Manager
16,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .",User Interface
16,"Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?",Project Manager
16,Yeah .,Marketing
16,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
16,Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?,User Interface
16,I dunno .,Project Manager
16,"Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,",Industrial Designer
16,{vocalsound},Project Manager
16,Ah yeah .,Marketing
16,but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .,Industrial Designer
16,{gap},Marketing
16,Maybe have {gap} uh {disfmarker},User Interface
16,{vocalsound},Marketing
16,"Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .",Project Manager
16,"Yeah , 'cause well {disfmarker}",User Interface
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,",Marketing
16,"Yeah , that's right , yeah .",Project Manager
16,and now you can put it always at the same place .,Marketing
16,Yeah .,User Interface
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"Maybe it's {disfmarker} Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .",Marketing
16,Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .,User Interface
16,"Yeah . You can {disfmarker} yeah , you can buy it with it .",Marketing
16,"Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
16,Rechargeable .,User Interface
16,"Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,",Industrial Designer
16,Yeah .,User Interface
16,"or you can change your batteries ,",Industrial Designer
16,Oh yeah .,Marketing
16,so .,Industrial Designer
16,"The option , just the option , that's cool .",Project Manager
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,",Marketing
16,Yeah .,Project Manager
16,"uh it has to lay good in the hand ,",Marketing
16,Yeah .,User Interface
16,you you have to uh {disfmarker},Marketing
16,Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control,Project Manager
16,"Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know",Marketing
16,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
16,"Well I think we have to look at that ,",User Interface
16,if we {disfmarker},Marketing
16,"'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}",User Interface
16,"You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,",Marketing
16,Yeah,Project Manager
16,but it's very hard to {disfmarker},Marketing
16,"N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .",Industrial Designer
16,"Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .",User Interface
16,Nah .,Marketing
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .",User Interface
16,Yeah .,Project Manager
16,"So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,",User Interface
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,so you can do something unique with that .,User Interface
16,"And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .",Industrial Designer
16,"Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .",Marketing
16,"Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .",Project Manager
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,",Marketing
16,But n {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
16,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface
16,"yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,",Industrial Designer
16,and if you fold it open {disfmarker},Marketing
16,But maybe it's,Project Manager
16,Yeah {gap} .,User Interface
16,{gap},Marketing
16,That's what I meant .,User Interface
16,so .,Industrial Designer
16,maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ?,Project Manager
16,Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .,Marketing
16,{gap} Maybe it's hard t,Project Manager
16,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
16,"No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} .",Project Manager
16,"Okay , but yeah .",User Interface
16,Just think about it .,Project Manager
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
16,"We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so .",Project Manager
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer
16,"There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to {disfmarker} what you have to do ?",Project Manager
16,Okay .,Marketing
16,Yeah .,Project Manager
16,"Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the {disfmarker}",Marketing
16,"{vocalsound} No , what you want to do with it .",User Interface
16,"Yeah , I think this {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together .",Project Manager
16,"Okay . Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh .",Marketing
16,"Yeah , everything .",Project Manager
16,"Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff",User Interface
16,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
16,that you want on a {disfmarker},User Interface
16,"no maybe not not uh {gap} , that's not a f that's something for for for {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
16,Technical fun fu,User Interface
16,That's not for you . Just if {disfmarker},Project Manager
16,Okay .,Marketing
16,"what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .",Project Manager
16,"What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .",User Interface
16,"Yeah , it's alright .",Project Manager
16,"I already wrote some down , some ideas .",User Interface
16,Yep .,Marketing
16,"Yeah , just {disfmarker} is that okay ?",Project Manager
16,Yep .,User Interface
16,Okay .,Marketing
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer
16,Okay .,Project Manager
16,There's already a document in the folder about it .,User Interface

16,Okay .,User Interface
16,"Okay , well done .",Marketing
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer
16,"For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so {disfmarker} your laptop .",Project Manager
16,I will .,User Interface
16,Oh Paul . {vocalsound},Marketing
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
16,{vocalsound},Project Manager
16,It didn't say that .,User Interface
16,"No , sorry .",Project Manager
16,Your fault .,User Interface
16,Ciao .,Marketing
16,{vocalsound},User Interface
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
16,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bye bye .,Marketing

17,"So , I will open our functional design meeting .",Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
17,"So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um",Project Manager
17,Industrial Design .,Industrial Designer
17,Marketing Expert .,Marketing
17,What's your talk ?,Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,Marketing Experts . {vocalsound},Project Manager
17,Mm .,Marketing
17,"And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .",Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,"Um , so you're participant two ?",Project Manager
17,One one .,Industrial Designer
17,No no no .,User Interface
17,No you're {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,One .,User Interface
17,"No ,",Project Manager
17,"Three three , it's three",Industrial Designer
17,I'm participant one . {vocalsound},Project Manager
17,sorry {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
17,I I think I'm a {gap} .,User Interface
17,"Okay , never mind .",Project Manager
17,Okay .,Marketing
17,"'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound}",Project Manager
17,In one .,User Interface
17,"In one , sorry {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,Isn't that technical functions ?,Project Manager
17,No sure .,Marketing
17,So you didn't save it maybe .,Industrial Designer
17,Uh,Marketing
17,It's mine .,User Interface
17,it's David Jordan . Course .,Marketing
17,"Alright , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So,Project Manager
17,David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
17,Mm yeah .,User Interface
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
17,so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .,Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,"No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .",Marketing
17,Uh .,Project Manager
17,Too great for email then .,Industrial Designer
17,"Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .",User Interface
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
17,Uh I I will focus on user interface design .,User Interface
17,Mm .,Project Manager
17,"Um so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide .",User Interface
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
17,So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So {disfmarker},User Interface
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation .,User Interface
17,So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .,Project Manager
17,"Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions ,",User Interface
17,"So powerful ,",Project Manager
17,but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful .,User Interface
17,many functions and very easy to use .,Project Manager
17,Yes . Yep .,User Interface
17,"So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,",Marketing
17,To merge the two system huh .,Industrial Designer
17,I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple,Marketing
17,Yeah .,User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,You mean this one ?,Project Manager
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,"Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .",Project Manager
17,Mm yep .,Industrial Designer
17,{gap},Marketing
17,But But this is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
17,But if we have very very good user interface,User Interface
17,"Yeah ,",Marketing
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
17,and then {disfmarker},Marketing
17,it take less time for user to learn how to use it .,User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,"Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign .",Industrial Designer
17,Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?,Project Manager
17,"Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .",Industrial Designer
17,"Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah . The user should know .",Marketing
17,"So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So .",Industrial Designer
17,Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,Yeah . So .,Industrial Designer
17,"Go on , go back and {disfmarker}",Project Manager
17,"Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .",Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . {vocalsound}",Marketing
17,"Yeah , that's my job . {vocalsound}",User Interface
17,{vocalsound} That's your job {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .,User Interface
17,{vocalsound},Marketing
17,It you {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
17,"So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use .",Project Manager
17,Yep .,User Interface
17,Okay .,Marketing
17,Okay .,Project Manager
17,Powerful and easy to use .,User Interface
17,So that's the point .,Marketing
17,"Yeah , that's the point .",User Interface
17,"So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .",Project Manager
17,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer
17,So you you're {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,Participant two . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
17,Um . Okay .,Project Manager
17,{gap},Marketing
17,"{vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
17,"So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay .",Project Manager
17,"So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the",Industrial Designer
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
17,"how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based",Industrial Designer
17,Mm .,Marketing
17,"but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_",Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
17,{vocalsound},Marketing
17,"so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
17,True .,Marketing
17,So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?,Project Manager
17,"I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
17,Okay .,Marketing
17,"Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen ,",Project Manager
17,What the cost is ?,Marketing
17,yeah . The cost {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,"Twelve , twelve a half .",Marketing
17,"Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here",Industrial Designer
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
17,and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .,Industrial Designer
17,That might just {disfmarker} So .,Marketing
17,You can go to the next slide .,Industrial Designer
17,Okay .,Project Manager
17,"I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff",Industrial Designer
17,Yeah .,Project Manager
17,"you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .",Industrial Designer
17,What is this ?,Project Manager
17,This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .,Industrial Designer
17,Okay .,Project Manager
17,Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .,Industrial Designer
17,Okay .,Project Manager
17,"So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .",Industrial Designer
17,Okay .,Project Manager
17,Okay .,Marketing
17,"Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?",Industrial Designer
17,What's the average price of this technology then ?,Marketing
17,"Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the",Industrial Designer
17,"So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}",User Interface
17,"{vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .",Industrial Designer
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .,Project Manager
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound} Okay . Okay .,User Interface
17,"{vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu",Project Manager
17,But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker},Marketing
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager
17,{vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .,User Interface
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,"I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,",Marketing
17,"Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,",Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
17,but in a sense {disfmarker},Marketing
17,sometime I want to have wire because you know .,Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?",Project Manager
17,{gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?,Project Manager
17,"Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .",Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound},User Interface
17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,"Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
17,"{vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .",Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .",Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,The wire ?,Marketing
17,As it's {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
17,Yeah . True .,Marketing
17,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer
17,I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .,Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker},Marketing
17,"{vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .",Project Manager
17,Now the {disfmarker},Marketing
17,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,"Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .",Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound} So,Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,just think of um the usability .,Project Manager
17,Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound},User Interface
17,Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?,Project Manager
17,Yeah .,User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,"I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,",Project Manager
17,"Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True .",Marketing
17,yeah .,Project Manager
17,This you will see in my presentation then .,Marketing
17,"{vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .",Project Manager
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,Okay {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
17,"Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .",Marketing
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
17,"Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .",Marketing
17,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
17,"Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}",Marketing
17,"You mean the loo the look , the outside ?",Project Manager
17,"The look , how it look like .",Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah , the the look is is bad for them",Marketing
17,Okay .,Project Manager
17,"so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .",Marketing
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
17,"So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,",Marketing
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
17,remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .,Marketing
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
17,"So this is from the experiments we've done ,",Marketing
17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager
17,"so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .",Marketing
17,{vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ?,Project Manager
17,"R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .",Marketing
17,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
17,Ah um okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
17,"Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .",Marketing
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
17,"And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,",Marketing
17,Functions .,User Interface
17,this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .,Marketing
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer
17,So {disfmarker},Marketing
17,"Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?",Project Manager
17,Yeah .,User Interface
17,Sure ? Yeah ?,Project Manager
17,"Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .",User Interface
17,Yeah .,Project Manager
17,So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .,User Interface
17,"Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?",Project Manager
17,But I'm not sure {disfmarker},User Interface
17,Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .,Project Manager
17,"Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the",Marketing
17,The manuals .,Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
17,manual .,Marketing
17,I think the {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,It's {disfmarker},Marketing
17,"No you you can have a switch menu , so you can",User Interface
17,"Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .",Project Manager
17,"well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .",User Interface
17,"Yeah , okay . Okay ,",Project Manager
17,"Then you you put the switch button ,",User Interface
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,"then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .",User Interface
17,With a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
17,"So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .",User Interface
17,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager
17,"But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny .",User Interface
17,Look fancy .,Industrial Designer
17,{gap},Marketing
17,"This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} .",Industrial Designer
17,Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .,User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,{vocalsound},User Interface
17,"Yeah , this is something we sh",Marketing
17,"Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so .",User Interface
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
17,"But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .",Marketing
17,I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .",Project Manager
17,"Specially distribution , yeah .",Marketing
17,"Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .",Industrial Designer
17,If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .,Project Manager
17,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
17,"Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker}",User Interface
17,"Yeah , it will cost little bit more .",Project Manager
17,"Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,",User Interface
17,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
17,some people prefer black remote control .,User Interface
17,"Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .",Marketing
17,And also f,Project Manager
17,"Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,",User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,"so user can select which colour they prefer , so .",User Interface
17,"Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,",Project Manager
17,"Yeah ,",Marketing
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,remember it's twelve Euros .,Marketing
17,"and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .",Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,Hmm .,Marketing
17,"And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .",Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about,Project Manager
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
17,and to discuss it with uh the other members .,Project Manager
17,"Yeah , hmm .",Industrial Designer
17,Yeah .,User Interface
17,"So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?",Project Manager
17,"Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .",Marketing
17,Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,So .,Marketing
17,"So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,It's is uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,"Lame , or {disfmarker}",Marketing
17,"No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .",Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,User Interface
17,"So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,",Project Manager
17,Yep .,Industrial Designer
17,"and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .",Project Manager
17,Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},User Interface
17,It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm,Marketing
17,because if we want to to do remote control,Project Manager
17,Mm .,User Interface
17,"which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?",Project Manager
17,Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .,User Interface
17,"So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .",Project Manager
17,Yeah . Okay .,User Interface
17,"And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .",Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .,Project Manager
17,Mm-hm .,User Interface
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
17,"So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um",Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,of the uh of real reaction,Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,So .,Industrial Designer
17,and uh also {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,So has to be yellow .,Marketing
17,Yellow .,Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .",Project Manager
17,Okay . Mm-hmm .,User Interface
17,"Require lot of requirements ,",Project Manager
17,"{vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah .",Industrial Designer
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,Yeah . And cheap .,User Interface
17,Yeah .,Project Manager
17,A low cost .,User Interface
17,Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .,Project Manager
17,"{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .",Industrial Designer
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
17,This is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
17,I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .,Marketing
17,"Maybe not ,",Project Manager
17,It's maybe more in browsing .,Marketing
17,but mayb,Project Manager
17,"Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .",Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it .",User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,"A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .",User Interface
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer
17,Ok,User Interface
17,Hm-mm .,Marketing
17,It's It's not so uh popular now . {vocalsound},User Interface
17,"It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know",Industrial Designer
17,Mm .,User Interface
17,"the global usage ,",Industrial Designer
17,"Global ,",User Interface
17,so if people don't have the technology .,Industrial Designer
17,okay .,User Interface
17,So .,Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
17,So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?,Project Manager
17,"So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?",User Interface
17,I think it has to be yellow .,Project Manager
17,{vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
17,Yeah .,Project Manager
17,Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound},User Interface
17,Min,Marketing
17,"Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .",Project Manager
17,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .,Industrial Designer
17,Why you go {disfmarker} It has to be fashion .,Project Manager
17,"Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,",Industrial Designer
17,So you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,but just mm .,Industrial Designer
17,"Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .",Project Manager
17,"Okay , okay . Okay .",User Interface
17,"And also it has to be attractive , of course ,",Project Manager
17,Mm .,User Interface
17,because if you want to sale {disfmarker} to sell the remote control . It's okay ?,Project Manager
17,"Regarding the first line , what {disfmarker} So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .",Marketing
17,Yeah .,Project Manager
17,And that's it .,Marketing
17,Yeah .,Project Manager
17,"But {disfmarker} I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .",Industrial Designer
17,It's already changed for {disfmarker},Marketing
17,I think it would be simpler .,Project Manager
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
17,"Okay . So {disfmarker} I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . Uh {disfmarker} Y you {disfmarker} You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um {disfmarker} pon",Project Manager
17,Industrial Designer .,Marketing
17,"Industrial Designer , yeah . Component component , yeah .",Industrial Designer
17,"yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .",Project Manager
17,Okay .,User Interface
17,And Florent to work my subject .,Project Manager
17,Yep .,Marketing
17,And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .,Project Manager
17,Okay .,Marketing
17,It's okay ?,Project Manager
17,Yeah .,Marketing
17,I think the um session is closed .,Project Manager
17,Good .,Industrial Designer
17,"And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . {vocalsound} Not in mine .",Project Manager
17,"Okay {vocalsound} Okay , that's clear .",Industrial Designer
17,Okay {vocalsound} . Okay . {vocalsound},User Interface
17,Should be better . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
18,"You could change the vegetable , or fruit .",User Interface
18,"yeah , I can change the vegetable .",Industrial Designer
18,Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .,Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .",Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,"You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
18,'S a very bright strawberry . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .",Industrial Designer
18,It's been a l,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .",User Interface
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
18,Oh yeah .,Project Manager
18,"And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}",User Interface
18,Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .,Industrial Designer
18,Okay so that's just {disfmarker},User Interface
18,And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere,Industrial Designer
18,So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker},User Interface
18,Yeah we didn't design that .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .,User Interface
18,But it would be coordinating with that of course .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
18,"You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}",User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,So . Tada .,User Interface
18,"Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be {disfmarker}",Project Manager
18,My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .,Industrial Designer
18,Oh . Okay .,Project Manager
18,"But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means .",Industrial Designer
18,Right .,Project Manager
18,One side is curved and then the other side is curved .,Industrial Designer
18,Well {disfmarker} yeah . If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?,Project Manager
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
18,Um and lots of special colours actually . {vocalsound} Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?,Project Manager
18,No I think that's alright .,Industrial Designer
18,"Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,And if we sold a lot of squishy things .,Project Manager
18,Mm .,User Interface
18,Boo yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} S So {disfmarker} Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Um evaluation criteria .,Marketing
18,Okay . Do you wanna {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,I've got a presentation .,Marketing
18,Okay . I think that's {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,"So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't {disfmarker} okay . Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?",Marketing
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
18,"Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .",Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .",Marketing
18,Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own {disfmarker} {gap},User Interface
18,Yeah it's in the um {disfmarker} it's in the project documents .,Marketing
18,Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .,User Interface
18,It's called evaluation criteria .,Marketing
18,Okay .,User Interface
18,And it's under evaluation .,Marketing
18,"Huh , the PowerPoint one ?",Project Manager
18,Hmm ?,Industrial Designer
18,Okay . Cool .,User Interface
18,Yeah . You've found it all ?,Marketing
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,So it was um {disfmarker} Yeah true's one .,Marketing
18,True's one and false is seven .,User Interface
18,Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?,Marketing
18,Um we can do it separately and then discuss it,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} Yeah okay .,Marketing
18,if if that's what people wanna do .,Project Manager
18,So it's actually a scale .,User Interface
18,"Wait , one is true and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
18,"{vocalsound} Um ,",Marketing
18,so these are the questions we're answering . And one is {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,"yes it's {disfmarker} if it's fancy you put one ,",Marketing
18,"One , right okay .",Project Manager
18,if it's really unfancy it's seven .,Marketing
18,If it's somewhere in between you put four .,Project Manager
18,"{vocalsound} Yeah , something .",Marketing
18,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
18,Okay . {vocalsound} Does it feel fancy ?,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} Feels like play-dough .,Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound},User Interface
18,They shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like {disfmarker} Are the batteries easy to insert ? {vocalsound},Marketing
18,I'm gonna say yes . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Yes ? Very very true . Okay .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound} I imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in .,Industrial Designer
18,Okay .,Marketing
18,Are we just about ready ?,Project Manager
18,Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we {disfmarker} um is it necessary ?,Marketing
18,I don't think so . It's {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,We'll just do um {disfmarker},Marketing
18,yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,{vocalsound} Yeah . Okay .,User Interface
18,Our animals will forever be there .,Project Manager
18,Yeah . Okay .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound} Un unless you feel you need it t to {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,I don't feel any {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing
18,okay okay .,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,We'll {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},User Interface
18,right um {disfmarker} Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle .,Marketing
18,'Kay,Industrial Designer

18,Five .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?,Marketing
18,I I think we should {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} It's four if you wanna do that .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,Yeah ?,Marketing
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"It adds to sixteen , so that's four .",Industrial Designer
18,Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two .,Marketing
18,Oh I thought she said five .,Industrial Designer
18,Hmm .,User Interface
18,"One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um {disfmarker} next ?",Marketing
18,Um three .,User Interface
18,Six .,Industrial Designer

18,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
18,Two .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound} I wasn't cheating I swear .,Project Manager
18,Uh-oh . Right . One point three is {disfmarker},Marketing
18,So it's a one was true and seven was false ?,User Interface
18,Uh .,Project Manager
18,Huh ?,Industrial Designer
18,"{gap} Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ?",User Interface
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,Oh I thought it was the other way round .,Project Manager
18,Wait a minute .,Industrial Designer
18,I really {disfmarker},Marketing
18,I thought it was the other way round too .,Industrial Designer
18,"{vocalsound} So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
18,Well uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing
18,"Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
18,Yeah yeah . It was one is true and {vocalsound} false is seven .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,I should've kept the table up .,Marketing
18,Oh gosh . Okay . Well {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"Right , well I'm glad this came out .",Marketing
18,{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} I thought you guys hated it . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? {vocalsound}",User Interface
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
18,{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} Oh that's quite funny {vocalsound} .,Marketing

18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"Okay . So , starting again , one point one ?",Marketing
18,One .,User Interface
18,Say two .,Industrial Designer
18,Three .,Project Manager
18,"Two . Okay , one point two ?",Marketing
18,Uh three .,User Interface

18,One .,Industrial Designer
18,Ha . {vocalsound} Two point one ?,Marketing
18,Two .,Project Manager
18,Uh two .,User Interface
18,Uh two .,Industrial Designer
18,"Two point {disfmarker} I think I missed two . {vocalsound} Wait , is that two point one ?",Project Manager
18,Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,"One point four , one point five . Okay right",Project Manager
18,"Oh dear , okay . Sorry .",Marketing
18,that's {disfmarker} I have two of them .,Project Manager
18,Mine has all kinds of problems .,Industrial Designer
18,Two and one .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound},User Interface
18,"Sorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five .",Marketing
18,One .,Project Manager
18,Uh three . Wait why did I put three ?,Industrial Designer
18,Uh one .,User Interface
18,I meant one on mine too .,Industrial Designer
18,Okay . Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ?,Marketing
18,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,Yeah ?,Marketing
18,Uh one .,User Interface
18,Three point one . I have four .,Industrial Designer

18,"One , two .",Marketing
18,One .,User Interface
18,Two .,Project Manager
18,Right so I put one on that .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .,Marketing
18,Okay . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .,Marketing
18,"No no that's um {disfmarker} I think we should look at the ones that {vocalsound} like where s where people said four , where {disfmarker} um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .",Project Manager
18,I didn't know how else to do it . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .,Marketing
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
18,Do {disfmarker} does every ones have the slide ?,Marketing
18,The {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Three point one .,Marketing
18,that was material .,Project Manager
18,"Slide show . Material {vocalsound} technologically innovative , okay . Um ,",Marketing
18,Mm .,Project Manager
18,"do you want to change it ? What are the suggestions ? I don't know , anyone ? {vocalsound}",Marketing
18,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ?,User Interface
18,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
18,Yeah that {disfmarker} it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .,Marketing
18,Does the shape {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,The shape .,Marketing
18,I think {disfmarker},User Interface
18,Four point two ?,Marketing
18,"See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the {disfmarker} is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It {disfmarker} or bigger ?",Project Manager
18,I think the wheel would probably be {disfmarker} mm .,Industrial Designer
18,Because {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,And like then it {disfmarker} you could hold it in your hand better .,User Interface
18,"I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .",Industrial Designer
18,"Yeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get {disfmarker} that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
18,The flat one . Yeah .,User Interface
18,so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,"{vocalsound} Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .",Project Manager
18,I didn't {disfmarker} yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker},User Interface
18,Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .,Industrial Designer
18,"But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .",User Interface
18,Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,",User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,like you could probably do a strawberry still .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,I think the broccoli would be out .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,"You could do {gap} , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like {disfmarker} sorta like a joystick .",User Interface
18,"Yeah that I I {disfmarker} when you were holding that before , it actually looked {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
18,Yeah . That looked really good .,Marketing
18,I don't know . So {disfmarker},User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?",Marketing
18,Uh .,User Interface
18,Not that I can think of . Rhubarb . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} Rhubarb .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound} I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound} These obscure fruits .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,Uh despite the {disfmarker},Marketing
18,{vocalsound} I think we needn't {disfmarker},User Interface
18,What if um the {disfmarker} it was just patterns on like {disfmarker} we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .,Project Manager
18,Huh ?,User Interface
18,You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .,Project Manager
18,Oh okay .,User Interface
18,"So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .",Industrial Designer
18,Yeah . That could work .,User Interface
18,Yeah . {gap},Marketing
18,Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Yeah . I dunno .,User Interface
18,But if we if we need {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Yeah and just have the colour match or something .,Marketing
18,"yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be {disfmarker}",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},User Interface
18,{vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .,User Interface
18,Mm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Mm .,Marketing
18,"Or like {disfmarker} I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think {disfmarker} see as like {disfmarker}",User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,"like you could {disfmarker} if it was only this {disfmarker} you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .",User Interface
18,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
18,So like maybe that's just too big,User Interface
18,"Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,",Project Manager
18,because {disfmarker},User Interface
18,which is a nice kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,yeah . But {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,{gap} I dunno .,User Interface
18,I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?,Project Manager
18,I guess {disfmarker},User Interface
18,'Cause like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,"We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .",Industrial Designer
18,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,Or like even {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Dif,User Interface
18,We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .,Industrial Designer
18,"Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?",Project Manager
18,Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .,User Interface
18,"'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .",Project Manager
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .,Project Manager
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,Mm .,User Interface
18,"And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Yeah . Yeah . Alright .,User Interface
18,But I mean it {disfmarker} do we have any other ideas about that ?,Project Manager
18,Um {disfmarker},Marketing
18,We could tr I don't know .,User Interface
18,"Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one . {vocalsound} . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,",Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .,Marketing
18,The batteries are going in the back ?,Project Manager
18,That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .,Industrial Designer
18,No .,Marketing
18,The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,"No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,",Industrial Designer
18,no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager
18,yeah um like on a normal remote .,Industrial Designer
18,Right .,Project Manager
18,"So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .",Industrial Designer
18,Okay .,Project Manager
18,I think everyone's under three anyway .,Marketing
18,Mm .,Project Manager
18,So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .,Marketing
18,Cool . Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .,Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing
18,Okay .,Project Manager
18,"Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} We were a bit off task .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Um so uh I can't think of any {disfmarker} So we'll have to like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,",User Interface
18,It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .,Industrial Designer
18,but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .,User Interface
18,"Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .",Project Manager
18,Yeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .,User Interface
18,I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah . Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Hmm .,User Interface
18,"Mm . {vocalsound} Not really {disfmarker} Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . {vocalsound} Um so project evaluation .",Project Manager
18,Do you want this and we can all {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .,Marketing
18,"I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied {disfmarker} oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah .",Project Manager
18,It's alright yeah ?,Marketing
18,Um {disfmarker} Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Sure .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,I did .,User Interface
18,I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound} Sponginess . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,The prototype making was very creatively stimulating,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria {vocalsound} .,User Interface
18,And how was our leadership and teamwork ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .,Industrial Designer
18,Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .,Project Manager
18,"{vocalsound} Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .",Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,"{vocalsound} Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Um .",Project Manager
18,I think you were fine .,User Interface
18,"Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now .",Project Manager
18,You did a good job leading .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,"Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .",Project Manager
18,Yeah we didn't {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} uh it all c sort of blended quite well .,Marketing
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like {vocalsound} I don't know , all had ideas about it but {disfmarker}",User Interface
18,"Yeah . Very democratic . No spats , that was good .",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} yeah .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,No . {vocalsound},User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,"{vocalsound} Um and the means for like {disfmarker} the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,I mean we used {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,"Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .",Industrial Designer
18,Are you a Mac person ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,No no I never touch Macs either .,Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,"I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .",Industrial Designer
18,Huh .,Project Manager
18,Hmm .,User Interface
18,Which isn't very user-friendly though . {vocalsound},Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,Yeah . {vocalsound} Well the problem is if you don't {disfmarker} like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now . But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .,Industrial Designer
18,"I felt like my {disfmarker} I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my {disfmarker} the information that was available to me was kind of just like {disfmarker} or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda {disfmarker} it was kinda like okay , I don't really think {disfmarker} I dunno what I'm doing here .",User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Mm .,Project Manager
18,"So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations ,",User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , {vocalsound} think it's kinda stupid .",User Interface
18,Yeah . I never use it .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah but uh {disfmarker},User Interface
18,I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Like I {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
18,It didn't really {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface
18,It {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .,Industrial Designer
18,I though it was brilliant no ? {vocalsound},Marketing
18,Really ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},User Interface
18,No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .,Marketing
18,I mean m my problem {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} Yeah it probably does .,Industrial Designer
18,So like a f,User Interface
18,I think it depends on the role,Marketing
18,"yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
18,Yeah I think so .,User Interface
18,no ?,Marketing
18,"'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like {disfmarker} they'd put {disfmarker} send you to sites and stuff right ?",Project Manager
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
18,"See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like {disfmarker}",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things ,",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,'cause I {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager
18,As if you'd wanted to .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um,Marketing
18,System . Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"a whole system ,",Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the {disfmarker},Marketing
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"Yeah I mean , it {gap}",User Interface
18,"Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
18,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing
18,"Yeah , huh .",Project Manager
18,It seems planned you know .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"Yeah I kinda thought that um {disfmarker} I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated",User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,because {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um {disfmarker},User Interface
18,Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like {disfmarker} we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,No . {vocalsound},Marketing
18,{vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,If I hadn't been told that fruit was {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
18,But I think that {vocalsound} it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .,Marketing
18,Oh right . given certain information or {disfmarker} Just {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,"Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input {disfmarker}",Marketing
18,yeah .,Project Manager
18,"I don't have a clue , anyway .",Marketing
18,"Mm , mm .",Project Manager
18,Um what's next ? Looks like {disfmarker} oh no that's not um {disfmarker},Marketing
18,What do you guys think of the pens ?,Project Manager
18,It's quite {disfmarker},Marketing
18,It asks about that .,Project Manager
18,They're pretty cool .,Industrial Designer
18,Mm .,Project Manager
18,I wanna s,User Interface
18,They're kinda hard to write with though .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah,Project Manager
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,and I I've f forgotten once or twice to {vocalsound} check the box . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the {disfmarker},User Interface
18,"They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write .",Industrial Designer
18,Mm .,Project Manager
18,"But even so , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
18,And new ideas found ?,Project Manager
18,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"Yeah it's all very new ,",Marketing
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager
18,no ? It's all very new .,Marketing
18,Yeah I think I'd like to um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I dunno . Like it was {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface
18,Sorry .,Marketing
18,"I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're {disfmarker} like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like .",User Interface
18,Oh yeah . Well they drop off if you like move too much .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah I dunno . But they're they're okay .,User Interface
18,But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . Maybe we are .,Industrial Designer
18,Mm .,Project Manager
18,I don't know . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"{vocalsound} Uh I think , and I think that uh all this technology like {disfmarker} I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes ,",User Interface
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company ,",Industrial Designer
18,or like {disfmarker} I dunno .,User Interface
18,and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . Like usually I missed meetings deliberately .,Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"There's just {disfmarker} there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company .",Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,It's mostly like rehashing old stuff .,Industrial Designer
18,Hm .,User Interface
18,And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,It's like the {disfmarker} there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .,Industrial Designer
18,Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration .,Project Manager
18,It seems like way overkill .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .,Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
18,Yeah .,Project Manager
18,"I guess it would be {disfmarker} it's gotta be worth it to {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . How about a p {vocalsound} a {gap} {vocalsound} ?",User Interface
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound},Marketing
18,{vocalsound} Um I dunno .,User Interface
18,Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Any other ideas for {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,What what's the end ? Are we are we supposed to um {disfmarker} you supposed to write a report ? Or we ending ?,Marketing
18,Um we still have time if there's any other input .,Project Manager
18,Is that the end ?,Marketing
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,"{vocalsound} I mean the {disfmarker} I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'Cause I mean we've all {disfmarker} we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy .",Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{gap},Marketing
18,Yeah .,User Interface
18,{vocalsound} So . Um .,Project Manager
18,"End of meeting . You have to tell her , she {disfmarker}",Marketing
18,So I think that's all for today . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,{vocalsound} Okay we have to fill in all this stuff .,Marketing
18,{vocalsound} M meeting adjourned .,User Interface
18,Stuff stuff stuff .,Marketing
18,Meeting adjourned .,Project Manager
18,Yeah .,Marketing
18,I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
18,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
18,"{vocalsound} I think it would be a good idea , I like it . {vocalsound}",User Interface
18,{vocalsound} It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . Especially if you have food .,Industrial Designer
18,So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 'Cause {disfmarker},Project Manager
18,All of us ?,Industrial Designer
18,I don't know . Hmm .,Project Manager
18,"Well there's al eight , nine .",Marketing
18,{vocalsound},User Interface
18,Ooh . Oh ooh .,Marketing
18,Hmm . Or is that just me ? {vocalsound},Project Manager

19,{gap},User Interface
19,{gap},Marketing
19,"Mm-hmm So , ready ? {gap}",Industrial Designer
19,'Kay,User Interface
19,No not really Just {disfmarker},Marketing
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager
19,Crap .,Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} Sorry , {vocalsound} I I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
19,Okay .,Marketing
19,It's perfect . {vocalsound},User Interface
19,{vocalsound} Your judgement it's {disfmarker} is biased . {vocalsound},Project Manager
19,I'm afraid {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,"'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ?",Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} So , we are {vocalsound}",Project Manager
19,Where ? {vocalsound},User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Marketing
19,It's here . {vocalsound},User Interface
19,So {vocalsound} let's go for our detailed design meeting .,Project Manager
19,Okay .,Industrial Designer
19,Yep .,Marketing
19,"So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan ,",Project Manager
19,Okay .,User Interface
19,{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
19,"{vocalsound} and our Industrial Designer , Baba .",Project Manager
19,Yeah . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,"{vocalsound} So we'll have to evaluate the uh {disfmarker} your proposed remote control ,",Project Manager
19,'Kay .,User Interface
19,and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . {vocalsound},Project Manager
19,{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} And in case if we're {disfmarker} we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production .",Project Manager
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker},Project Manager
19,I have slides .,User Interface
19,"You have s oh , sorry .",Project Manager
19,Okay .,Industrial Designer
19,Oops .,Project Manager
19,"Ah ,",User Interface
19,Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .,Industrial Designer
19,Product prod,User Interface
19,What slides ?,Marketing
19,"Yep . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay .",User Interface
19,Looks strange . {vocalsound},Project Manager
19,"Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour ,",User Interface
19,Okay .,Project Manager
19,"uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .",User Interface
19,Okay .,Industrial Designer
19,It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design .,User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager
19,"It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .",User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Marketing
19,{vocalsound} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,So this is a introduction of our product .,User Interface
19,"{vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but",Project Manager
19,Next a mo,User Interface
19,Yeah .,Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",User Interface
19,{vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking .,Project Manager
19,"yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .",User Interface
19,{vocalsound} Oh .,Project Manager
19,"{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
19,"Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
19,"{vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .",User Interface
19,"Yeah , that's true .",Industrial Designer
19,"Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel .",User Interface
19,Chan,Project Manager
19,So it's quite convenient for user to use it .,User Interface
19,"Yeah , okay , but don't touch {disfmarker} don't destroy your prototype . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
19,"Yeah , s {vocalsound}",User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,"okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface
19,Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom .,Project Manager
19,Yeah {gap} .,Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush Mushroom design , yeah .",User Interface
19,"Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh {vocalsound} like lemon shape , you know , centre {vocalsound} is yellow and t d",Industrial Designer
19,Yeah,User Interface
19,Okay .,Project Manager
19,"Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . {vocalsound}",User Interface
19,"To integrate , you know {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager
19,"I don't think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I hope nobody will eat it {gap} You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} in",Industrial Designer
19,Oh .,Project Manager
19,Yeah,User Interface
19,"Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .",Marketing
19,Fruits and vegetables .,Project Manager
19,"Really ? But {disfmarker} Fruit and vegetable ,",Industrial Designer
19,Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable .,Project Manager
19,so mushroom was a kind of you know {gap} uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface
19,I don't think it is .,Marketing
19,It's vegetable .,Project Manager
19,Mushroom ?,Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
19,"Oh , uh I'm not sure . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
19,So th it's something eatable .,Project Manager
19,"We can {disfmarker} it's a veg a kind of vegetable ,",Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,Marketing
19,but you know we we integrated them with different colour .,Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,"But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .",Marketing
19,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
19,"{disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable {gap} you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .",Industrial Designer
19,"No , I mean , yeah {vocalsound} yeah . Inspira inspiration is {disfmarker}",Marketing
19,And inspired colour,Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager
19,"and {vocalsound} and very sophisticated material , so .",Industrial Designer
19,True .,Marketing
19,And so {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,Next slide .,Project Manager
19,"Uh , no this our only two slides . {vocalsound}",User Interface
19,{gap},Project Manager
19,"So what we w what I can add is that , you know {vocalsound} he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip ,",Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,"it is a low level chip , and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,So we cut it to see . {vocalsound},User Interface
19,"You know , we don't need to k {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
19,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
19,You know wi {vocalsound} the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i,Industrial Designer
19,Okay . So where's the battery battery ?,User Interface
19,The battery it is under {gap} .,Industrial Designer
19,In the base .,Project Manager
19,"It is in th in {disfmarker} in the base , yeah . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
19,In the basement . In the basement .,Project Manager
19,Base . Here ?,User Interface
19,And where is the solar solar cell ?,Project Manager
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,But we say uh we sa we said solar .,Marketing
19,Where is the solar cell ?,Project Manager
19,In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,Oh . Do you think it won't be {disfmarker} It won't cris increase the price ?,Project Manager
19,Okay,User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} {gap} I don't think so ,",Industrial Designer
19,"Okay , we'll see after .",Project Manager
19,"{vocalsound} but it it's might be okay , so .",Industrial Designer
19,We will have first to {disfmarker},Project Manager
19,I it might be okay . So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,"so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?",Project Manager
19,Yeah .,Marketing
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,"I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about {disfmarker} uh",Marketing
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,"we had three keys {disfmarker} {vocalsound} key points to uh for this remote control design ,",Marketing
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,and first one was uh,Marketing
19,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
19,fancy look and feel .,Marketing
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,"So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think .",Marketing
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,Uh just let me check .,Marketing
19,"So , four point {disfmarker} three point five , it means it's acceptable .",Industrial Designer
19,"One one being true , and seven being false . Okay .",Marketing
19,Oops .,Industrial Designer
19,Ouch . So,Marketing
19,Okay .,User Interface
19,"Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?",Marketing
19,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface
19,I think you have nice colours . {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,But is it {disfmarker},Marketing
19,The sha the bowl shape people like .,Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour {disfmarker}",User Interface
19,"Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really {disfmarker}",Marketing
19,{vocalsound} Is it really fancy ?,Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound} So it depend on how d do you define fancy .,User Interface
19,"Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .",Marketing
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,But it's {disfmarker} you have the lemon aspect of this th this {vocalsound} this thing . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,"Maybe if you change {disfmarker} if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that {disfmarker}",Project Manager
19,"{vocalsound} Do Don't do that , please .",Industrial Designer
19,"I dunno where the lemon is , but",Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,I mean it's not obvious .,Marketing
19,It would be bet more like a lemon ?,Project Manager
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,If {disfmarker},Marketing
19,Because i,Industrial Designer
19,"I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or {disfmarker}",Marketing
19,Yeah .,Project Manager
19,Less button .,Industrial Designer
19,"Uh so , my mush {disfmarker} .",User Interface
19,{gap},Industrial Designer
19,Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?,Project Manager
19,"Yeah , but you don't have any button now .",Industrial Designer

19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,"That's uh yeah , is that {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,Hmm .,User Interface
19,that's a good idea .,Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah , it's getting {disfmarker}",Marketing
19,It looks {vocalsound} more like a pineapple .,Project Manager

19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Marketing
19,Sorry .,Project Manager
19,That's great . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,What's the use for that ?,Project Manager
19,"I have no idea , so . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
19,"Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .",User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager
19,I have no idea {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} And where is the voice recognition ?,Project Manager
19,Okay .,Marketing
19,"Uh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone .",User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,Okay .,Project Manager
19,Th this th th there's two two functions .,User Interface
19,"Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Wait th that's the second point .",Marketing
19,This is microphone array {disfmarker},User Interface
19,First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .,Marketing
19,If it is fancy or not .,Industrial Designer
19,Okay . Is it better like that ?,Project Manager
19,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing
19,"Looks {disfmarker} okay ,",Project Manager
19,So we can we can say t,Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,let's say it's a pineapple now . {vocalsound},Project Manager
19,"The colour , is the colour acceptable ?",Industrial Designer
19,"{vocalsound} No , the colour is okay , that's fine .",Marketing
19,So the shape now .,Industrial Designer
19,I mean it's {disfmarker},Marketing
19,It looks like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Project Manager
19,but I would say there is more {disfmarker} too much red .,Marketing
19,now you took it .,Project Manager
19,It's too much red ?,Industrial Designer
19,Um if,Marketing
19,In the basement ?,Industrial Designer
19,It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top .,Project Manager
19,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface
19,"{vocalsound} Right . So , from one to seven ?",Marketing
19,{vocalsound} I will give {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound} Mm uh {disfmarker} Seven is the ma the maximum ?,Project Manager
19,I'll gi,Industrial Designer
19,"No , seven is false and one is true .",Marketing
19,I'll give two or three .,Industrial Designer
19,"Three , I will say three .",Project Manager
19,"Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .",Industrial Designer
19,Three ?,Marketing
19,'Kay,User Interface
19,Okay .,Marketing
19,Isn't it bitter like that {gap} ?,Project Manager
19,Three .,Marketing
19,Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
19,Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker},Marketing
19,What other {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .,Marketing
19,Is it easy to use ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,Feasible ? {vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an,Project Manager
19,Ye uh {disfmarker} Embedded .,Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact .",User Interface
19,"It's a micro array , okay .",Industrial Designer
19,There four microphone .,User Interface
19,"Oh . Okay ,",Project Manager
19,So they they they they {disfmarker} there's a microphone array .,User Interface
19,and you have the {disfmarker} there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?,Project Manager
19,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface
19,And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?,Project Manager
19,"So you can capture voice {disfmarker} yeah , you c",User Interface
19,"Oh yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .",User Interface
19,"And I think you {disfmarker} you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is {disfmarker} I",Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .",Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} W Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,We have tactile buttons .,Project Manager
19,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
19,"I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,"No , that's good . Yeah .",Marketing
19,That's good .,Industrial Designer
19,"Oh , yeah .",Project Manager
19,"Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe {disfmarker} okay .",Marketing
19,"I think technically it's acceptable , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,Maybe two ?,Project Manager
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
19,"So using the same scale , two ?",Marketing
19,Two ? I would say two,Project Manager
19,"Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .",Industrial Designer
19,. You agree ?,Project Manager
19,"Yeah , I agree .",User Interface
19,Okay .,Marketing
19,"It's better like that , isn't it ?",Project Manager
19,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
19,Now maybe the most critical one .,Marketing
19,Okay .,Project Manager
19,{vocalsound} Most {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ?,Marketing
19,"Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking .",Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah , it's very easy .",User Interface
19,You just need the command .,Industrial Designer
19,You can use this in this way .,User Interface
19,Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker},Marketing
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager
19,As a principle . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,{vocalsound} Please .,Marketing
19,Th this is the base .,User Interface
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,So you can turn to change the channel .,User Interface
19,Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?,Marketing
19,You just tu turn d d,User Interface
19,I think maybe if you he,Industrial Designer
19,"Oh , ok I understand .",Project Manager
19,Like if you want to go from {disfmarker},Marketing
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,"You take take {vocalsound} the remote , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
19,If you hear some click {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,and you can turn like that to change the channel ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
19,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
19,Yeah but imagine you y,Marketing
19,"I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,"Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?",Marketing
19,"Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .",Industrial Designer
19,Yeah .,User Interface
19,"How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? {vocalsound}",Marketing
19,"No , no , no . I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker}",User Interface
19,Yeah .,Marketing
19,it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker},User Interface
19,Yeah . I agree . I agree .,Marketing
19,Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,But I mean if you're fro from two ?,Marketing
19,"I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .",User Interface
19,I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah , you have a {vocalsound} , like that , and so on .",Project Manager
19,So change . Yeah .,User Interface
19,And you you can {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker},Marketing
19,Oh yeah .,Project Manager
19,Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree .,User Interface
19,We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing
19,So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker},User Interface
19,Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker},Project Manager
19,"I think you can if you have a scale , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,"No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn ,",User Interface
19,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
19,then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker},User Interface
19,Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?,Marketing
19,"It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker}",User Interface
19,"So you you count {gap} one degree , two degrees , no .",Marketing
19,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .",User Interface
19,I don't think so . {vocalsound},Marketing
19,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's a bit difficult .",Industrial Designer
19,"I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it . {vocalsound} I think so , you can just change .",User Interface
19,"I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker},Marketing
19,"There's uh also a number , you know .",User Interface
19,"Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .",Project Manager
19,"Uh , yeah , and y that's {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer
19,"But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it .",Project Manager
19,"And this would be more for browsing , ah .",Marketing
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,Yeah .,Marketing
19,Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?,Project Manager
19,Yeah . To see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
19,yeah {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface

19,{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,"It's like fine , from coarse to fine .",User Interface
19,Mm .,Marketing
19,"This is coarse , this is fine .",User Interface

19,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
19,Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .,Marketing
19,"Yeah is is {disfmarker} this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel .",User Interface
19,S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates,Industrial Designer
19,This is from one channel to {disfmarker},User Interface
19,maybe one of the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
19,"Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .",Project Manager
19,Uh it's k {gap},Industrial Designer

19,{gap},User Interface
19,{vocalsound} Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean .,Industrial Designer
19,{vocalsound},User Interface
19,And what's your opinion ?,Project Manager
19,Will you give four ?,Industrial Designer
19,"Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .",Marketing
19,"Five ? Yeah , so maybe if {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
19,Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ?,User Interface
19,Yeah .,Marketing

19,Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
19,"There's two kind of balls ,",User Interface
19,So you have {disfmarker},Marketing
19,the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale .,User Interface

19,"But in the traditional controller , how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale ?",User Interface
19,Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .,Marketing
19,"You just push two button , zero and and one .",Industrial Designer
19,"Yeah ,",User Interface
19,And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
19,"yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .",User Interface
19,Yeah .,Marketing
19,Are there some buttons ? Okay .,Industrial Designer

19,It's impossible . {vocalsound},Project Manager
19,{vocalsound} Oh,Industrial Designer
19,You need to put it on and turn . {vocalsound},Project Manager
19,"Yeah . You know tha that's the weak point ,",Marketing
19,{vocalsound} You use your y,User Interface
19,because with a traditional one you just have one hand .,Marketing
