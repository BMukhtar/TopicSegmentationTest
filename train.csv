1,"{vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah .",User Interface,47,160421,163001
1,Of our prototype .,User Interface,47,163201,164281
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,48,164481,165201
1,The basic {disfmarker} okay .,Project Manager,49,165401,167141
1,Okay .,Project Manager,49,167341,167701
1,Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?,Project Manager,49,167901,170841
1,Yes .,Marketing,50,171041,171341
1,Okay .,Project Manager,51,171541,171901
1,Uh my name is not name,Marketing,52,172101,173421
1,{vocalsound} You are nameless .,Project Manager,53,173621,175481
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,53,175681,176401
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,54,176601,177321
1,but {disfmarker},Marketing,55,177521,178481
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,56,178681,179401
1,"Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents .",Marketing,57,179601,183441
1,And these uh were the most important criteria .,Marketing,57,183641,186461
1,{vocalsound} Is it spongy ?,Industrial Designer,58,186661,188281
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,58,188481,189201
1,It should be .,Marketing,59,189401,190241
1,"{gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah ,",Marketing,59,190441,192721
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,60,192921,193641
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,61,193841,194561
1,that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it .,Marketing,62,194761,197401
1,Fancy look and feel .,Marketing,62,197601,198861
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing,62,199061,199961
1,So just walk through it step by step .,User Interface,63,200161,202441
1,"I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy .",User Interface,63,202641,207561
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,63,207761,208481
1,Uh well appar,Marketing,64,208681,209461
1,I believe it's fancy too .,Industrial Designer,65,209661,211221
1,"Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet .",Marketing,66,211421,214541
1,No .,Project Manager,67,214741,214981
1,"Oh , sorry .",User Interface,68,215181,215901
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing,69,216101,217001
1,"Okay , so",Project Manager,70,217201,217741
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,71,217941,218301
1,this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria .,Project Manager,72,218501,221621
1,"Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .",Marketing,73,221821,225061
1,"Okay , well {disfmarker}",Project Manager,74,225261,226701
1,So uh,Marketing,75,226901,227201
1,the then we'll switch to my presentation .,Project Manager,76,227401,229921
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,76,230121,231021
1,that's about it .,Marketing,77,231221,232241
1,The production costs .,Project Manager,78,232441,233761
1,The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker},Project Manager,78,233961,239721
1,Twenty two .,User Interface,79,239921,240641
1,"Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty .",Project Manager,80,240841,245161
1,Yikes .,User Interface,81,245361,245781
1,And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell .,Project Manager,82,245981,250001
1,"So I guess we should skip that ,",Project Manager,82,250201,252121
1,Well it's very expensive .,Industrial Designer,83,252321,253881
1,because it's not that important .,Project Manager,84,254081,256061
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,85,256261,256621
1,"Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa",User Interface,86,256821,259701
1,"Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .",Project Manager,87,259901,263741
1,yeah .,User Interface,88,263941,264301
1,The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,88,264501,266661
1,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,89,266861,268001
1,"Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model .",Project Manager,90,268201,271441
1,Um if you would {disfmarker},Project Manager,90,271641,273321
1,And and does it {disfmarker},User Interface,91,273521,275201
1,"if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes .",Project Manager,92,275401,285901
1,"Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,",Project Manager,92,286101,293241
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,93,293441,293921
1,because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .,Project Manager,94,294121,297661
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,95,297861,298341
1,"Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,96,298541,306941
1,"Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .",Project Manager,96,307141,312781
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,97,312981,313281
1,"So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .",Project Manager,98,313481,317981
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,99,318181,318541
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,100,318741,319641
1,But I'm afraid it's not complete .,Industrial Designer,101,319841,321881
1,"Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item .",Industrial Designer,101,322081,326161
1,And you have not added one item there .,Industrial Designer,101,326361,328701
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,102,328901,329261
1,So it's c way too expensive .,Industrial Designer,103,329461,331201
1,"It's still too expensive , yeah .",Project Manager,104,331401,333381
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,104,333581,334481
1,But that's that's only for the buttons .,User Interface,105,334681,337081
1,"I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,106,337281,342141
1,So the button we can use plastic .,User Interface,107,342341,344381
1,oh .,Project Manager,108,344581,344821
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,108,345021,345741
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,109,345941,346661
1,And uh maybe not use the special form .,Project Manager,110,346861,349201
1,"And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .",User Interface,111,349401,355161
1,But it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,112,355361,356501
1,"{vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .",Project Manager,113,356701,360361
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,114,360561,360861
1,But it's the board decision .,Project Manager,115,361061,362801
1,Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,115,363001,365521
1,"Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .",Industrial Designer,116,365721,379401
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,117,379601,379961
1,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,117,380161,381061
1,Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,117,381261,385761
1,So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment .,Industrial Designer,118,385961,389321
1,"Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic",Project Manager,119,389521,394561
1,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,120,394761,395121
1,and uh m maximise the profits,Project Manager,121,395321,397061
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,122,397261,397561
1,and um {disfmarker},Project Manager,123,397761,398901
1,That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better .,Industrial Designer,124,399101,401561
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,124,401761,402481
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,125,402681,403041
1,"Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,",Industrial Designer,126,403241,407381
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,127,407581,407941
1,but that's not what uh has been asked .,Industrial Designer,128,408141,410481
1,"I know , I know .",Project Manager,129,410681,411701
1,So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,130,411901,416461
1,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,131,416661,417801
1,"Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .",Project Manager,131,418001,428201
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,132,428401,428701
1,Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .,Project Manager,133,428901,434481
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,134,434681,434981
1,Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device .,Project Manager,135,435181,438841
1,"Definitely not , no .",Project Manager,135,439041,440301
1,{vocalsound} It's not that innovative .,Project Manager,135,440501,442841
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,136,443041,443761
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,137,443961,444681
1,Or however you s pronounce that .,Project Manager,138,444881,446861
1,"Yeah , too bad .",User Interface,139,447061,448021
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,139,448221,448941
1,"Um so , okay .",Project Manager,140,449141,449981
1,"{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,",Project Manager,140,450181,452161
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,141,452361,453081
1,this is the wrong one .,Project Manager,142,453281,454661
1,So uh that means redesign .,Project Manager,142,454861,456481
1,{vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .,Project Manager,142,456681,461121
1,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,143,461321,461801
1,Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went .,Project Manager,144,462001,467881
1,Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first .,Project Manager,144,468081,471681
1,I guess {disfmarker},Project Manager,144,471881,473081
1,"Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Marketing,145,473281,478021
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,146,478221,478581
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,146,478781,479501
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,147,479701,480421
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,148,480621,481341
1,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager,149,481541,482741
1,"Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .",Industrial Designer,150,482941,490261
1,We l we can learn .,Project Manager,151,490461,491601
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,151,491801,492161
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,151,492361,492721
1,I agree .,Project Manager,151,492921,493461
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,152,493661,494561
1,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,153,494761,495781
1,Is it fancy ?,Industrial Designer,154,495981,496761
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,154,496961,497681
1,I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,155,497881,500341
1,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,156,500541,501441
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,157,501641,502361
1,Yay .,Marketing,158,502561,502861
1,Is it ?,Marketing,158,503061,503481
1,Is it fancy ?,Marketing,158,503681,504461
1,"Yeah , I think so .",Project Manager,159,504661,505801
1,"Um the yellow rubber , I think so .",User Interface,160,506001,508101
1,I think so .,Industrial Designer,161,508301,509021

1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,165,516521,517241
1,So uh one ?,Marketing,166,517441,518101
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,167,518301,518661
1,But it's not that fancy .,Industrial Designer,168,518861,520361
1,"No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .",Project Manager,169,520561,522661
1,I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing .,Industrial Designer,170,522861,530421
1,It would be even more {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,170,530621,532661
1,You like tita {vocalsound},Project Manager,171,532861,534421
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,172,534621,535341

1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,173,538821,539541
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,174,539741,540461
1,That's a flavour as well .,Project Manager,175,540661,542221
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,176,542421,543141
1,It has flavour .,Industrial Designer,177,543341,544301
1,"Yes , that's right .",Industrial Designer,177,544501,545701
1,{vocalsound} You should taste it .,Industrial Designer,177,545901,547941
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,177,548141,548861
1,{vocalsound} Right .,Project Manager,178,549061,550261

1,{vocalsound},User Interface,179,551561,552281
1,"Yeah , I know ,",Project Manager,180,552481,553381
1,Is it uh {disfmarker},Marketing,181,553581,554841
1,but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker},Project Manager,182,555041,562421
1,"It has to do with fashion , I guess .",Industrial Designer,183,562621,564841
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,184,565041,565401
1,"It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,185,565601,568601
1,So do {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,186,568801,569881
1,And w,Marketing,187,570081,570381
1,yeah .,User Interface,188,570581,570941
1,"yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials .",Marketing,189,571141,575881
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,190,576081,576441
1,So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy .,Marketing,191,576641,580001
1,It applies .,Project Manager,192,580201,580921
1,It {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,192,581121,582441

1,"It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker}",User Interface,197,586861,590041
1,I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case .,Industrial Designer,198,590241,599301
1,"It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .",Industrial Designer,198,599501,607061
1,"Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,199,607261,609901
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,200,610101,611001
1,"{vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case .",User Interface,201,611201,617921
1,"We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours .",User Interface,201,618121,621481
1,That's two out of three .,User Interface,201,621681,623181
1,So I believe uh we are close uh to two .,User Interface,201,623381,625781
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,202,625981,626281
1,"Yeah , I I agree .",Project Manager,203,626481,627561

1,It's okay .,Industrial Designer,204,629101,629761
1,"We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good .",Industrial Designer,204,629961,632661
1,"Okay , and uh was it innovative ?",Marketing,205,632861,634841
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,206,635041,635761
1,"Well ,",Project Manager,207,635961,636321
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,208,636521,637241
1,with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,209,637441,640681
1,But that's not in it .,User Interface,210,640881,642201
1,Ov or can we {disfmarker},User Interface,210,642401,643901
1,Yep .,Marketing,211,644101,644401
1,"No , we are evaluating this this uh design now .",Project Manager,212,644601,647481
1,This prototype .,Project Manager,212,647681,648641
1,"Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product .",Industrial Designer,213,648841,651601
1,Okay .,User Interface,214,651801,652161
1,So I I I think it is .,Industrial Designer,215,652361,653681
1,I think it's innovative .,Industrial Designer,215,653881,655381
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,216,655581,655941
1,{vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel .,User Interface,217,656141,658421
1,"The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think .",User Interface,217,658621,662581
1,No .,Industrial Designer,218,662781,663021
1,"It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,218,663221,670661
1,"Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,219,670861,672421
1,That would have been a thrill .,Project Manager,220,672621,674481
1,"yes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,221,674681,676001
1,So uh also a uh two ?,Marketing,222,676201,677461
1,I think uh it's a two .,Industrial Designer,223,677661,679041
1,Yep .,Project Manager,224,679241,679541
1,Is it easy to use ?,Marketing,225,679741,680881
1,I'm not sure .,Project Manager,226,681081,681921
1,{vocalsound} I'm not sure .,Project Manager,226,682121,683741
1,Yeah .,User Interface,227,683941,684301
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,228,684501,685221
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,229,685421,686141
1,"Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think .",User Interface,230,686341,690661
1,"Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly .",User Interface,230,690861,695001
1,They won't use it .,User Interface,230,695201,696341
1,"{vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control .",Industrial Designer,231,696541,700621
1,What you see here is is the basic part .,Industrial Designer,231,700821,703221
1,"Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .",Industrial Designer,231,703421,706181
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,232,706381,706741
1,That's for a novice user .,Industrial Designer,233,706941,708501
1,"When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .",Industrial Designer,233,708701,716441
1,"So in that in that way it is advanced ,",Industrial Designer,233,716641,718981
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,234,719181,719541
1,and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .,Industrial Designer,235,719741,723401
1,I think {disfmarker} I think a three .,User Interface,236,723601,725881
1,So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,237,726081,730941
1,{vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .,User Interface,238,731141,733301
1,Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well .,Project Manager,239,733501,736321
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,239,736521,737421
1,Well the p the most important function is easy to use .,Marketing,240,737621,740921
1,"The the zapping , channel switching , volume .",Marketing,240,741121,743881
1,But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .,Marketing,240,744081,747621
1,Okay .,Project Manager,241,747821,748181
1,Uh two or three ?,Project Manager,241,748381,749401
1,Three ?,Project Manager,241,749601,750021
1,Wha wh what would be your guess ?,Project Manager,241,750221,752201
1,I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .,Project Manager,241,752401,756661
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,242,756861,757221
1,It's the uh it's it's overall .,Project Manager,243,757421,759281
1,Is the device easy to use ?,Project Manager,243,759481,761101
1,"Yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer,244,761301,762561
1,"You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,",Industrial Designer,244,762761,770861
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,245,771061,771421
1,because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .,Industrial Designer,246,771621,776061
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,247,776261,776621
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,248,776821,777721
1,Um {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,249,777921,779241
1,"After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two .",Industrial Designer,250,779441,783281
1,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,250,783481,784441
1,"Uh Roo , a three ?",Project Manager,251,784641,785721
1,Yep .,User Interface,252,785921,786221
1,Ruud ?,Project Manager,253,786421,786781
1,Good question .,Marketing,254,786981,787881
1,Uh I'll go uh for the two .,Marketing,254,788081,789701
1,Okay .,Project Manager,255,789901,790261
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,255,790461,791181
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,256,791381,792101
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,257,792301,793021
1,"So , it's two , two and three .",Industrial Designer,258,793221,795081
1,Two threes .,Industrial Designer,258,795281,796001
1,So that's ten .,Industrial Designer,258,796201,797101
1,So I could make it e easy ?,Project Manager,259,797301,798921
1,If you make it a four it will be three in general .,User Interface,260,799121,802181
1,"So that's w No , two and a half .",Industrial Designer,261,802381,804361
1,If he makes it a four .,User Interface,262,804561,805941
1,Not a three .,User Interface,262,806141,806921
1,Six and four .,Industrial Designer,263,807121,807961
1,Six and four is ten .,Industrial Designer,263,808161,809421
1,Divided by four is two and a half .,Industrial Designer,263,809621,811721
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,263,811921,812821
1,Darn .,User Interface,264,813021,813381
1,Nee .,User Interface,264,813581,813881
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,265,814081,814381
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,265,814581,815301
1,Hmm ?,Marketing,266,815501,815801
1,Huh ?,Marketing,266,816001,816301
1,Roo .,Project Manager,267,816501,816801
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,267,817001,817721
1,"A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .",User Interface,268,817921,820801
1,Yeah .,Marketing,269,821001,821361
1,I yeah {gap} .,Marketing,269,821561,822401
1,A four and a three together .,User Interface,270,822601,824341
1,{vocalsound} Four ?,Industrial Designer,271,824541,825681
1,"Yeah , you have a two , he has a two .",User Interface,272,825881,828161
1,Three ?,User Interface,272,828361,828781
1,"Yeah ,",Marketing,273,828981,829341
1,Two ?,Industrial Designer,274,829541,829841
1,"two , two , three {disfmarker}",Marketing,275,830041,831841
1,"No ,",Project Manager,276,832041,832281
1,And a three ?,User Interface,277,832481,833261
1,I haven't said anything yet .,Project Manager,278,833461,835201
1,Nee .,User Interface,279,835401,835701
1,I know .,User Interface,279,835901,836381
1,No .,Marketing,280,836581,836821
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,280,837021,837741
1,"Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten .",Project Manager,281,837941,842081
1,Divided by four is two point five .,Project Manager,281,842281,844381
1,Divided by four .,Industrial Designer,282,844581,845601
1,Yes .,User Interface,283,845801,846101
1,So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three .,User Interface,283,846301,850441
1,Then you would make a four .,User Interface,283,850641,852321
1,If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,283,852521,856181
1,But I'm filling in a three .,Project Manager,284,856381,858061
1,That's not even {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,285,858261,859941
1,Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .,Project Manager,286,860141,864401
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,287,864601,865321
1,"But that's not possible to fill in ,",Industrial Designer,288,865521,867681
1,"Yes , it is .",Project Manager,289,867881,868661
1,so we have to round it .,Industrial Designer,290,868861,870301
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,290,870501,871221
1,{vocalsound} Is it easy to find ?,Marketing,291,871421,873401
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,291,873601,874321
1,{vocalsound} I have a veto .,Project Manager,292,874521,876201
1,{vocalsound} Exactly .,Project Manager,292,876401,877721
1,"It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .",Project Manager,292,877921,883801
1,"Yeah ,",User Interface,293,884001,884361
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,294,884561,884861
1,"we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .",User Interface,295,885061,891481
1,It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy .,Industrial Designer,296,891681,894921
1,"Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,297,895121,897401
1,"Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,298,897601,902521
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,299,902721,903021
1,Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,299,903221,906341
1,"I'm here , I'm here .",Project Manager,300,906541,907801
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,300,908001,908721
1,something like that .,Industrial Designer,301,908921,910181
1,"Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here .",Industrial Designer,301,910381,920581
1,So something like that .,Industrial Designer,301,920781,922221
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,302,922421,922781
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,302,922981,923341
1,But even without it {disfmarker},User Interface,303,923541,925461
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,304,925661,926021
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,305,926221,926941
1,"Well , I uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,306,927141,928581
1,"So , I th",Industrial Designer,307,928781,929321
1,"we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .",Project Manager,308,929521,935761
1,Yeah .,User Interface,309,935961,936321
1,Um Sebastian ?,Project Manager,310,936521,937361
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , me too .",Industrial Designer,311,937561,939241
1,Me too .,User Interface,312,939441,939921
1,"Yeah , I agree .",Marketing,313,940121,941081
1,"Right , well .",Project Manager,314,941281,942121
1,The feel of the remote control is spongy .,Project Manager,314,942321,944841
1,"Well , uh",Project Manager,314,945041,945581
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,315,945781,946501
1,it can't be more spongy .,Project Manager,316,946701,948201
1,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,316,948401,950081
1,"Well , it can be .",Industrial Designer,317,950281,951361
1,There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .,Industrial Designer,317,951561,959241
1,Was it one of our options ?,User Interface,318,959441,961061
1,"No , it's not one of our option ,",Industrial Designer,319,961261,963241
1,No .,Marketing,320,963441,963681
1,Uh,Marketing,320,963881,964001
1,"No okay , but but",Project Manager,321,964201,965221
1,"So , in the in {disfmarker}",User Interface,322,965421,967041
1,"but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,323,967241,970841
1,this this was a most spongy option .,Marketing,324,971041,973201
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,324,973401,974121
1,"for the options given , it's the most spongy one .",Project Manager,325,974321,977321
1,"Uh yes ,",Industrial Designer,326,977521,978001
1,Yeah .,User Interface,327,978201,978561
1,"but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think .",Industrial Designer,328,978761,982841
1,Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market .,Industrial Designer,328,983041,991141
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,329,991341,991701
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,329,991901,992261
1,So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy .,Industrial Designer,330,992461,996721
1,They're out there .,Industrial Designer,330,996921,998061
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,330,998261,998981
1,{vocalsound} They're out there .,Project Manager,331,999181,1001101
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,331,1001301,1002021
1,{vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .,User Interface,332,1002221,1007081
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,333,1007281,1008001
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,334,1008201,1008561
1,"Yes , but it's not good enough ,",Industrial Designer,335,1008761,1010681
1,{vocalsound} I'll give it a one .,Project Manager,336,1010881,1012861
1,so it's a two .,Industrial Designer,337,1013061,1013961
1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one .,User Interface,338,1014161,1016981
1,You take one ?,Industrial Designer,339,1017181,1018021
1,What do you give it ?,Industrial Designer,339,1018221,1019481
1,"Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker}",Marketing,340,1019681,1024121
1,"Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number .",Project Manager,341,1024321,1027681
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,341,1027881,1028601
1,but {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing,342,1028801,1030181
1,Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time .,Project Manager,343,1030381,1034461
1,"Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .",Marketing,344,1034661,1038561
1,It will be a one .,User Interface,345,1038761,1039841
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,345,1040041,1040761
1,So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .,Marketing,346,1040961,1044501
1,No no no .,Industrial Designer,347,1044701,1045301
1,"Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .",Industrial Designer,347,1045501,1049521
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,347,1049721,1050441
1,{vocalsound} You are {disfmarker},Project Manager,348,1050641,1052621
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,349,1052821,1053541
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,350,1053741,1054461
1,okay .,Project Manager,351,1054661,1055021
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,352,1055221,1055941
1,The remote control offers enough features .,Project Manager,353,1056141,1058721
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,354,1058921,1059641
1,"Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?",Project Manager,355,1059841,1062661
1,"Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot .",Marketing,356,1062861,1069281
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing,356,1069481,1070381
1,{vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .,Industrial Designer,357,1070581,1074061
1,"Yeah , depends .",Marketing,358,1074261,1075221
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,359,1075421,1075781
1,You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .,Industrial Designer,360,1075981,1080661
1,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,361,1080861,1081761
1,So it's quite advanced .,Industrial Designer,362,1081961,1083401
1,What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,363,1083601,1086721
1,"Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits .",User Interface,364,1086921,1090161
1,"I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .",User Interface,364,1090361,1100441
1,I think it has .,Project Manager,365,1100641,1101601
1,Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat,Marketing,366,1101801,1105041
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,367,1105241,1105601
1,"Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .",Project Manager,367,1105801,1113961
1,"So ,",Project Manager,367,1114161,1114401
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,368,1114601,1114901
1,"you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .",Project Manager,369,1115101,1126141
1,Has uh the signals sent to it .,Industrial Designer,370,1126341,1128201
1,Yeah .,User Interface,371,1128401,1128761
1,Signal .,Marketing,372,1128961,1129441
1,"So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .",Project Manager,373,1129641,1138581
1,So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .,Project Manager,373,1138781,1144061
1,Absolutely .,Industrial Designer,374,1144261,1144981
1,"Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .",Project Manager,375,1145181,1149801
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,376,1150001,1150301
1,"But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons .",Industrial Designer,376,1150501,1159441
1,At at least uh forty buttons .,Industrial Designer,376,1159641,1161441
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,377,1161641,1162001
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,377,1162201,1162561
1,So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to .,Industrial Designer,378,1162761,1166301
1,And this is quite s simple .,Industrial Designer,378,1166501,1168181
1,Yep .,Project Manager,379,1168381,1168681
1,You can use your voice to to programme it .,Industrial Designer,380,1168881,1171461

2,Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .,Marketing,38,102361,109501
2,"Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,",Marketing,38,109701,128601
2,{vocalsound},User Interface,39,128801,129521
2,It's okay {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,40,129721,131161
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,41,131361,132081
2,sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} .,Marketing,42,132281,134441
2,Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later .,Marketing,42,134641,141481
2,So that was one of the first things we did .,Marketing,42,141681,144321
2,"Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .",Marketing,42,144521,155621
2,"{vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .",Marketing,42,155821,170101
2,"They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .",Marketing,42,170301,178521
2,"Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .",Marketing,42,178721,192461
2,"So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .",Marketing,42,192661,202501
2,Yeah .,Project Manager,43,202701,203061
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .",Marketing,44,203261,222281
2,So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?,Marketing,44,222481,227761
2,"There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .",Marketing,44,227961,234321
2,"So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan .",Marketing,44,234521,241901
2,Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .,Marketing,44,242101,245641

2,Okay .,Industrial Designer,63,277141,277501
2,Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .,Industrial Designer,63,277701,285561
2,"Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method .",Industrial Designer,63,285761,288761

2,"There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,",Industrial Designer,69,337021,352681
2,Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?,Project Manager,70,352881,355161
2,people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .,Industrial Designer,71,355361,359321
2,"Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .",Project Manager,72,359521,361561

2,Alright i,Industrial Designer,84,410621,411161
2,"Any , any {disfmarker}",Project Manager,85,411361,412681

2,Yep .,User Interface,87,414101,414401

2,Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .,Industrial Designer,88,428001,435261

2,Yeah,Industrial Designer,100,464501,464741
2,Right .,User Interface,101,464941,465361

2,Night .,User Interface,103,470081,470501

2,Okay .,Project Manager,106,483821,484181
2,The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches,Industrial Designer,107,484381,489301
2,Yeah I've seen {disfmarker},Project Manager,108,489501,491121
2,and you d you don't even notice it .,Industrial Designer,109,491321,493481

2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,112,522961,523441

2,We c,User Interface,116,536061,536301

2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,118,543601,543961
2,"so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time .",Project Manager,119,544161,549021
2,If you'd {disfmarker},Project Manager,119,549221,550481
2,Yeah and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,120,550681,551941
2,"I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .",Project Manager,121,552141,559821
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,122,560021,560501
2,Yeah but then again,Industrial Designer,123,560701,561841
2,Is it really gonna be enough ?,Project Manager,124,562041,563841
2,"I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .",Industrial Designer,125,564041,577421
2,Okay .,Project Manager,126,577621,577981

2,So it's not {disfmarker} the draw on it isn't {disfmarker},Project Manager,128,587681,591161
2,and you put it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,129,591361,592981
2,Hmm .,Marketing,130,593181,593481
2,no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,131,593681,597581
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,132,597781,598261
2,Mm .,Marketing,132,598461,598701
2,Okay .,Project Manager,133,598901,599261
2,"Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?",Marketing,134,599461,606181
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,135,606381,606621
2,"I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging",Marketing,136,606821,614261
2,Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing,Industrial Designer,137,614461,618301
2,or the two things not compatible ?,Marketing,138,618501,620541
2,Like a dual kind of .,Project Manager,139,620741,622001
2,"but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .",Industrial Designer,140,622201,636241
2,Mm .,Marketing,141,636441,636681
2,So that affects the exterior design .,Marketing,141,636881,639101
2,Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .,User Interface,142,639301,641821
2,Expensive as well .,Project Manager,143,642021,643161

2,"They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,144,646741,649801
2,It's twelve point f,User Interface,145,650001,651141
2,I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?,Project Manager,146,651341,654281

2,Solar .,Project Manager,148,666381,666801
2,'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y,Industrial Designer,149,667001,670781
2,Well they're not designed {disfmarker},Project Manager,150,670981,673261
2,"the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .",Industrial Designer,151,673461,681621
2,Practical-wise okay .,Project Manager,152,681821,683081
2,"Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically .",Industrial Designer,153,683281,685861
2,"I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,",Industrial Designer,153,686061,691581
2,You do get a bit of wear,Project Manager,154,691781,693221
2,they can t,Industrial Designer,155,693421,694021
2,but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?,Project Manager,156,694221,697461
2,"Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .",Industrial Designer,157,697661,705101
2,Mm .,Project Manager,158,705301,705541
2,Mm .,Marketing,159,705741,705981

2,Again it de,Marketing,161,708601,709261
2,sorry .,User Interface,162,709461,709881

2,W m yeah,Industrial Designer,165,720281,720761

2,Mm .,Marketing,167,723501,723741
2,"so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .",Industrial Designer,168,723941,741761

2,Okay .,User Interface,173,756201,756561
2,Can we think about that ?,Project Manager,174,756761,758261
2,'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,174,758461,762121
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,175,762321,762681
2,Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker},Marketing,176,762881,769241
2,Well add it in to think about um,Project Manager,177,769441,771361
2,"right , okay .",Marketing,178,771561,772401
2,"because , where am I ?",Project Manager,179,772601,773921
2,If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,179,774121,783421
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,180,783621,783981
2,"we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .",Project Manager,181,784181,795341
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,182,795541,795901
2,But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than,Project Manager,183,796101,801141

2,Okay .,Project Manager,190,814481,814841
2,So {disfmarker},User Interface,191,815041,815941
2,when we threw it open to the field yeah .,Marketing,192,816141,818601
2,Okay .,Industrial Designer,193,818801,819161
2,But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .,Marketing,194,819361,822961
2,"Okay , right .",Project Manager,195,823161,824001
2,"Okay , well I'll move on .",Industrial Designer,196,824201,825761
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,197,825961,826441
2,"Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .",Industrial Designer,198,826641,858441
2,What kind of things do we have to consider there ?,Project Manager,199,858641,861641
2,"Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,199,861841,870481
2,Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in .,Industrial Designer,200,870681,887601
2,"If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,",Industrial Designer,200,887801,897641
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,201,897841,898321
2,Okay .,Project Manager,201,898521,898881
2,"if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit",Industrial Designer,202,899081,909941
2,Okay .,Project Manager,203,910141,910501
2,"so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used .",Industrial Designer,204,910701,919581
2,"Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,",Industrial Designer,204,919781,936401

2,Okay .,User Interface,208,949621,949981

2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,210,962561,963041
2,and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical .,Industrial Designer,211,963241,970321

2,Mm .,Marketing,214,983481,983721
2,"but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer,215,983921,996101

2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,217,996861,997341
2,I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said .,Industrial Designer,218,997541,1006061
2,Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case .,Industrial Designer,218,1006261,1015561

2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,223,1043001,1043361

2,Mm .,Marketing,225,1052401,1052641

2,Yeah I th,Industrial Designer,227,1056041,1056581
2,or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker},User Interface,228,1056781,1059961
2,Uh .,Industrial Designer,229,1060161,1060401
2,"Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,229,1060601,1066841
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,230,1067041,1067521
2,"it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,231,1067721,1078641
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,232,1078841,1079321
2,it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .,Industrial Designer,233,1079521,1085641
2,It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall .,Marketing,234,1085841,1088841

2,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,235,1094881,1095661
2,"I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,",Marketing,236,1095861,1102341
2,"Rubber , yeah .",Industrial Designer,237,1102541,1103441
2,"that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .",Marketing,238,1103641,1109821
2,And you can peel them off yeah .,Industrial Designer,239,1110021,1111941
2,Yeah .,User Interface,240,1112141,1112501
2,"So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,",Project Manager,241,1112701,1118881

2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,256,1144401,1144761

2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,262,1161161,1161641
2,"Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option .",Industrial Designer,263,1161841,1180921
2,"Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch",Industrial Designer,263,1181121,1201641

2,Uh-huh .,User Interface,268,1220061,1220541

2,Okay .,User Interface,270,1228021,1228381

2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,373,1643221,1643581
2,Okay .,Project Manager,374,1643781,1644141

2,Okay .,Project Manager,376,1653241,1653601
2,"And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button .",User Interface,377,1653801,1662801

4,Okay .,User Interface,45,126501,126861
4,Okay .,Marketing,46,127061,127421
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,46,127621,128341
4,"Um so {disfmarker} yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly .",Project Manager,47,128541,134121
4,It's it's still the same .,Project Manager,47,134321,135881
4,Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at .,Project Manager,47,136081,139441
4,You all know them .,Project Manager,47,139641,140781
4,But uh there's another point .,Project Manager,47,140981,142781
4,The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people .,Project Manager,47,142981,147781
4,So they're old and not younger people .,Project Manager,47,147981,150321
4,So we have to look at that as well .,Project Manager,47,150521,152681
4,"'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .",Project Manager,47,152881,157201
4,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,48,157401,158181
4,"Uh so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,49,158381,164981
4,Which one first ?,User Interface,50,165181,166201
4,Okay .,Marketing,51,166401,166761
4,"Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,52,166961,170261
4,Okay .,User Interface,53,170461,170821
4,Mm .,Marketing,54,171021,171261
4,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,54,171461,172361
4,"Functional requirements , yeah",User Interface,55,172561,174361
4,Okay .,Marketing,56,174561,174921
4,"Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it .",Marketing,56,175121,179681
4,Wait .,Marketing,56,179881,180241
4,Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site .,Marketing,56,180441,183321
4,Uh I think you've uh read it too .,Marketing,56,183521,185561
4,Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .,Marketing,56,185761,189481
4,"I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me ,",Project Manager,57,189681,192561
4,You didn't read it ?,Marketing,58,192761,193961
4,I didn't get it uh anyway .,Project Manager,59,194161,195781
4,"No , I didn don't thing we got it .",User Interface,60,195981,198081
4,It's only for you .,Project Manager,61,198281,199421
4,"Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it .",Marketing,62,199621,202201
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,63,202401,202761
4,Yes .,User Interface,64,202961,203261
4,Okay it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users .,Marketing,65,203461,209221
4,And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .,Marketing,65,209421,216321
4,So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings .,Marketing,65,216521,221261
4,So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control .,Marketing,65,221461,225001
4,Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .,Marketing,65,225201,229521
4,"Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control .",Marketing,65,229721,234701
4,Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .,Marketing,65,234901,240061
4,I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people .,Marketing,65,240261,245841
4,Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good .,Marketing,65,246041,250661
4,Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .,Marketing,65,250861,256561
4,Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .,Marketing,65,256761,261621
4,"Well okay , that's uh normal .",Marketing,65,261821,263621
4,I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons .,Marketing,65,263821,266881
4,But that's one of our requirements .,Marketing,65,267081,269241
4,The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,66,269441,273281
4,"Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .",Marketing,67,273481,277981
4,So,Project Manager,68,278181,278301
4,Um Martijn alr already said it .,Marketing,69,278501,280421
4,if we {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,70,280621,282121
4,"And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but {disfmarker} I don't think it's uh",Marketing,71,282321,287961
4,"Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,",Project Manager,72,288161,291581
4,reachable .,Marketing,73,291781,292441
4,then you're you're {disfmarker},Project Manager,74,292641,294501
4,"Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .",Marketing,75,294701,297221
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,76,297421,297781
4,That that's a good one .,Marketing,77,297981,299421
4,Um uh page two .,Marketing,77,299621,300581
4,Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .,Marketing,77,300781,304021
4,That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something .,Marketing,77,304221,311301
4,"Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something .",Marketing,77,311501,318701
4,Uh you must find it uh quickly .,Marketing,77,318901,320821
4,Uh .,User Interface,78,321021,321261
4,Maybe just a button on the home station .,User Interface,78,321461,323921
4,So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .,User Interface,78,324121,328441
4,"Okay , yeah .",Marketing,79,328641,329421
4,"Yeah , we can uh combine that .",Marketing,79,329621,331481
4,Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control .,Marketing,79,331681,335881
4,Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this .,Marketing,79,336081,338781
4,It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent .,Marketing,79,338981,343121
4,But it's uh a tough one .,Marketing,79,343321,344821
4,"Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think .",Marketing,79,345021,352161
4,"Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .",Marketing,79,352361,355121
4,"Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something .",Marketing,79,355321,360481
4,I don't {disfmarker} We we haven't {disfmarker} Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point .,Marketing,79,360681,366561
4,"Okay , last page .",Marketing,79,366761,367841
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,80,368041,368761
4,"Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition .",Marketing,81,368961,373581
4,We didn't uh think about that already .,Marketing,81,373781,376121
4,And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control .,Marketing,81,376321,378721
4,We already thought about that .,Marketing,81,378921,380781
4,Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features .,Marketing,81,380981,388841
4,And but they're more critical .,Marketing,81,389041,390901
4,And older people uh want to spend uh more money .,Marketing,81,391101,394041
4,"{vocalsound} But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way .",Marketing,81,394241,401921
4,And they want to keep the old uh things the old things .,Marketing,81,402121,405481
4,{gap},Marketing,81,405681,405981
4,So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .,Project Manager,82,406181,408701
4,But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?,Marketing,83,408901,414361
4,People .,Project Manager,84,414561,415041
4,"So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,",Project Manager,84,415241,419201
4,"I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,",Marketing,85,419401,423721
4,Yeah .,User Interface,86,423921,424281
4,because {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,87,424481,426101
4,because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .,Marketing,88,426301,429301
4,It's too {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,89,429501,431181
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,90,431381,431741
4,Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference .,Marketing,91,431941,435241
4,"Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ .",Marketing,91,435441,442341
4,I had a question about .,Marketing,91,442541,443981
4,"But it's already out of the question , this .",Marketing,91,444181,446881
4,"Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros .",Marketing,91,447081,457161
4,But it's the exercise .,Marketing,91,457361,458741
4,Because it's too expensive .,Project Manager,92,458941,460621
4,"Yeah , probably .",Project Manager,92,460821,461841
4,"Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything .",Marketing,93,462041,469721
4,"And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .",Marketing,93,469921,475441
4,"Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .",User Interface,94,475641,478461
4,"Okay , I told about the home station .",Marketing,95,478661,480941
4,"Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it .",Marketing,95,481141,486001
4,And I I found a motto .,Marketing,95,486201,487581
4,And we put the fashion in electronics .,Marketing,95,487781,490121
4,And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style .,Marketing,95,490321,494701
4,We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product .,Marketing,95,494901,497841
4,We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,95,498041,500201
4,"One of a kind , I think .",Marketing,95,500401,501901
4,"So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,",Project Manager,96,502101,504201

4,"{vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .",Marketing,98,505081,510121

4,"Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker}",User Interface,100,511901,513581
4,But old people are not looking for that .,Project Manager,101,513781,516241
4,Uh I think mm {disfmarker},User Interface,102,516441,518001
4,Not really .,Project Manager,103,518201,518921
4,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,104,519121,520021
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,105,520221,520581

4,Yeah .,User Interface,106,526501,526861
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing,107,527061,527421
4,Okay .,Project Manager,108,527621,527981
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,108,528181,528541
4,to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker},Marketing,109,528741,531381
4,"But uh we also have to stand out ,",User Interface,110,531581,533621
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,111,533821,534181
4,"Sorry I thought about it , yes .",Marketing,112,534381,536301
4,"'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff .",User Interface,113,536501,541961
4,"But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it .",User Interface,113,542161,547561

4,isn't it ?,Project Manager,127,570821,571421
4,Okay .,User Interface,128,571621,571981
4,Technical functions design .,User Interface,128,572181,573861
4,"Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience .",User Interface,128,574061,577001
4,Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore .,User Interface,128,577201,579841
4,"But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple .",User Interface,128,580041,583761
4,Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard .,User Interface,128,583961,587981
4,So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls .,User Interface,128,588181,591901
4,"Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .",User Interface,128,592101,596601
4,So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker},Project Manager,129,596801,601481
4,"Yeah , I have it on the next page .",User Interface,130,601681,603781
4,Okay .,Project Manager,131,603981,604341
4,But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .,User Interface,132,604541,608381
4,"Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons .",User Interface,132,608581,616741
4,"Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does .",User Interface,132,616941,621501
4,So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it .,User Interface,132,621701,625361
4,"Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control",User Interface,132,625561,637141
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,133,637341,637701
4,to find out .,User Interface,134,637901,638681
4,But there is already in a one done .,User Interface,134,638881,641041
4,Of functions I could think of .,User Interface,134,641241,643101
4,"Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} .",User Interface,134,643301,646721
4,Just one two three etcetera .,User Interface,134,646921,648661
4,Uh text service options .,User Interface,134,648861,650361
4,Um basic on-off .,User Interface,134,650561,651581
4,And I found an uh {disfmarker} Could I think of favourites ?,User Interface,134,651781,655381
4,I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .,User Interface,134,655581,660381
4,Okay .,Project Manager,135,660581,660941
4,"But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker}",User Interface,136,661141,667621
4,"Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel .",Industrial Designer,137,667821,671961
4,So you might as well remember the number .,Industrial Designer,137,672161,674681
4,Or not ?,Industrial Designer,137,674881,675361
4,"Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,",Project Manager,138,675561,677721
4,No y,User Interface,139,677921,678161
4,but not sure {gap} .,Project Manager,140,678361,679561
4,Well,User Interface,141,679761,680001
4,"It's a good idea , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,142,680201,682301
4,it's {disfmarker} It was just a thought .,User Interface,143,682501,684961
4,"So I'm , I u {disfmarker} I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .",User Interface,143,685161,692301
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,144,692501,693281
4,But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?,Industrial Designer,144,693481,698401
4,Well uh,User Interface,145,698601,699021
4,Uh {gap} {disfmarker},Project Manager,146,699221,700481

4,"Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television .",User Interface,147,702801,707601
4,So switch to channel six .,User Interface,147,707801,709361
4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,148,709561,709921
4,So uh button six says says six .,User Interface,149,710121,712041

4,"Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons .",User Interface,196,842321,847241
4,So you have that uh {disfmarker},User Interface,196,847441,849361
4,A ten plus or {disfmarker},Project Manager,197,849561,851121

4,Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,201,866121,868341
4,Uh yeah mayb,User Interface,202,868541,869261
4,It gets some seconds .,Marketing,203,869461,870781
4,But I think that's in the T_V_ as well .,User Interface,204,870981,873381
4,That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it .,User Interface,204,873581,876221
4,But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .,User Interface,204,876421,880201
4,Oh okay .,Industrial Designer,205,880401,880941
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,205,881141,881501
4,"Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}",Marketing,206,881701,884281
4,So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .,User Interface,207,884481,888681
4,"Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,208,888881,891041
4,It's what Paul says .,Marketing,209,891241,892501
4,It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two .,Marketing,209,892701,897081
4,It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .,Marketing,209,897281,904421
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,210,904621,904981
4,"So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .",User Interface,211,905181,910701
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,212,910901,911261
4,"So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that {disfmarker} And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and {disfmarker}",User Interface,213,911461,921961
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,214,922161,922521
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,214,922721,923081
4,But do we still need a two level remote control ?,Project Manager,215,923281,926221
4,Because if we only have that l only f,Project Manager,215,926421,928641
4,It's only for television now .,Marketing,216,928841,930641
4,So I I don't think so .,User Interface,217,930841,932221
4,No .,Project Manager,218,932421,932661
4,Uh I just thought of another one .,User Interface,219,932861,934901
4,No .,Marketing,220,935101,935341
4,Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .,User Interface,221,935541,938541
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,222,938741,939101
4,So you also need a menu button .,User Interface,223,939301,941221
4,"And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker} But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,",User Interface,223,941421,947421
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,224,947621,947981
4,so you have,User Interface,225,948181,948841
4,"I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .",Industrial Designer,226,949041,959661
4,four arrows .,User Interface,227,959861,960641

4,"Yeah , okay ,",User Interface,229,963681,964461
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,230,964661,965561
4,but um {disfmarker},User Interface,231,965761,966901
4,"Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure .",Project Manager,232,967101,970161
4,You'll also have to use a mute button to to {disfmarker},Project Manager,232,970361,973721

4,Yes .,User Interface,233,975441,975741
4,"Maybe , not {disfmarker}",Project Manager,234,975941,977381
4,Don't think so .,User Interface,235,977581,978541
4,I don't know where where you have to put it .,Project Manager,236,978741,981441
4,"Yeah well ,",User Interface,237,981641,982301
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,238,982501,983221
4,that's that's {disfmarker} I think that's the layers that produce .,User Interface,239,983421,987441
4,Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on .,User Interface,239,987641,990701
4,What we're gonna use .,User Interface,239,990901,992221
4,Okay .,Project Manager,240,992421,992781
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,240,992981,993341
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,240,993541,993901
4,That's right .,Project Manager,240,994101,994941
4,And later we can d uh do the design .,User Interface,241,995141,997361
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,242,997561,997921
4,"Okay , uh now my personal preferences .",User Interface,243,998121,1000461
4,"Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design .",User Interface,243,1000661,1007981
4,"So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual .",User Interface,243,1008181,1012021
4,"So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out .",User Interface,243,1012221,1017621
4,Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .,User Interface,243,1017821,1021961
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,244,1022161,1022521
4,Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours,Project Manager,244,1022721,1027101
4,Um {disfmarker} I dunno .,User Interface,245,1027301,1028801
4,Different colours um {disfmarker},User Interface,245,1029001,1030981
4,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,246,1031181,1032081
4,Maybe we can give it out in different colours .,Marketing,247,1032281,1035101
4,You can choose blue or yellow,Marketing,247,1035301,1037041
4,It's like a iMac or something .,Project Manager,248,1037241,1039101
4,or {disfmarker},Marketing,249,1039301,1040201
4,{vocalsound} Just to make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,250,1040401,1043641
4,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,251,1043841,1044321

4,That's fa That's fancy .,Marketing,253,1047641,1049081
4,That's uh fashion .,Marketing,253,1049281,1050421
4,"But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing .",Project Manager,254,1050621,1054041
4,It's only twenty five Euros .,Project Manager,254,1054241,1055981

4,Just {disfmarker},Project Manager,260,1070421,1071441
4,They they're uh designed very well .,User Interface,261,1071641,1073801
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,262,1074001,1074361
4,"And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller .",User Interface,263,1074561,1077801
4,"You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .",User Interface,263,1078001,1084121
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,264,1084321,1084681

4,"Okay , sorry .",User Interface,269,1092821,1093661
4,Is it fin Are you finished ?,Project Manager,270,1093861,1095541
4,Well uh {disfmarker},User Interface,271,1095741,1096941
4,Okay .,Project Manager,272,1097141,1097501
4,"Yeah , I I'm finished .",User Interface,273,1097701,1099081
4,I think we discussed everything .,User Interface,273,1099281,1101261
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,274,1101461,1101821
4,"Well , the working design .",Industrial Designer,274,1102021,1103641
4,The method I used is uh search the web .,Industrial Designer,274,1103841,1106241
4,Just the web page provided .,Industrial Designer,274,1106441,1108121
4,"Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out .",Industrial Designer,274,1108321,1114321
4,"Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch .",Industrial Designer,274,1114521,1121901
4,"And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed .",Industrial Designer,274,1122101,1127081
4,"So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern .",Industrial Designer,274,1127281,1133461
4,Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ .,Industrial Designer,274,1133661,1138101
4,"That's the uh light emitting diode , I think .",Industrial Designer,274,1138301,1141061
4,Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light .,Industrial Designer,274,1141261,1145101
4,That's un uh invisible to the human eye .,Industrial Designer,274,1145301,1147761
4,And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ .,Industrial Designer,274,1147961,1150181
4,However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it .,Industrial Designer,274,1150381,1155601
4,"And that's uh another diode , I believe .",Industrial Designer,274,1155801,1158261
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,275,1158461,1158941
4,Because infrared is not visible .,Industrial Designer,276,1159141,1161121
4,So that's er uh do two different things,Industrial Designer,276,1161321,1163661
4,So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?,Project Manager,277,1163861,1167041
4,but {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,278,1167241,1168621
4,I I think so .,Industrial Designer,278,1168821,1169661
4,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,278,1169861,1170581
4,Uh j Is {disfmarker},User Interface,279,1170781,1171981
4,I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .,Industrial Designer,280,1172181,1174521
4,"Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable .",Project Manager,281,1174721,1177481
4,Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?,User Interface,282,1177681,1180861

4,Yeah .,Project Manager,284,1182581,1182941
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,285,1183141,1183501
4,"Or just a green one ,",Project Manager,286,1183701,1184961
4,So {disfmarker},User Interface,287,1185161,1186061
4,"because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .",Project Manager,288,1186261,1191061
4,Yeah .,User Interface,289,1191261,1191621
4,Maybe uh {disfmarker},User Interface,289,1191821,1193081
4,I I think it's in the case that it's active .,Marketing,290,1193281,1195981
4,It's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing,290,1196181,1197621
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,291,1197821,1199081
4,"Yeah , when you press it .",Industrial Designer,292,1199281,1200841
4,But if you {disfmarker},Project Manager,293,1201041,1202421
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,294,1202621,1203521
4,I it's it's just uh the the {disfmarker},Marketing,295,1203721,1206121

4,"and green is like it's okay , you press the button .",Project Manager,298,1209481,1212601
4,Mm .,Marketing,299,1212801,1213041
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,300,1213241,1214201
4,Maybe depends on uh {disfmarker},User Interface,301,1214401,1216321
4,Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .,Industrial Designer,302,1216521,1219761

4,"Okay , we make it red .",Project Manager,307,1223221,1224601

4,So,Industrial Designer,309,1226321,1226441
4,Well,User Interface,310,1226641,1226881
4,I know .,Industrial Designer,311,1227081,1227561
4,we don't have to make it red .,User Interface,312,1227761,1229561
4,Maybe integrate it in the design as well .,User Interface,312,1229761,1232281
4,You have to {disfmarker} The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons .,Project Manager,313,1232481,1238841
4,Uh that's cool .,Project Manager,313,1239041,1240001

4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,328,1270521,1270881
4,That it's working .,Industrial Designer,328,1271081,1272221
4,That it's not not the batteries are low .,Industrial Designer,328,1272421,1274881
4,But it's cool if it was green .,Project Manager,329,1275081,1276941
4,Yeah .,User Interface,330,1277141,1277501
4,"It's it's not very important ,",User Interface,330,1277701,1279501

4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,331,1282241,1282961
4,so yeah .,User Interface,332,1283161,1283701
4,"Yeah , I know .",Industrial Designer,333,1283901,1284801
4,Just to indicate it's working .,Industrial Designer,333,1285001,1286861
4,So mm {disfmarker},User Interface,334,1287061,1288141
4,And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern .,Industrial Designer,335,1288341,1291461
4,"So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal .",Industrial Designer,335,1291661,1296821
4,So that it can be used with all the T_V_s .,Industrial Designer,335,1297021,1299601
4,"We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work .",Industrial Designer,335,1299801,1306641
4,"So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,336,1306841,1311341
4,No .,Industrial Designer,337,1311541,1311781
4,I I uh {disfmarker} The chip um uh is producing the pattern .,Industrial Designer,337,1311981,1315641
4,"So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,337,1315841,1320761
4,Okay .,User Interface,338,1320961,1321321
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,339,1321521,1321881
4,"An automatically search function for each television , or something .",Marketing,340,1322081,1326221
4,That are working .,Industrial Designer,341,1326421,1327501
4,"Yeah , or {disfmarker} I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works .",Industrial Designer,341,1327701,1331601
4,It wasn't explained there .,Industrial Designer,341,1331801,1333421
4,"Well , I I use a universal uh remote control ,",User Interface,342,1333621,1336381
4,Uh I kno,Marketing,343,1336581,1337061
4,"and {gap} list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera .",User Interface,344,1337261,1340441

4,"And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink .",Marketing,349,1349161,1354621
4,And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off .,Marketing,349,1354821,1358481
4,"And then you know , oh it it's the right one .",Marketing,349,1358681,1361441
4,"And you can stop it ,",Marketing,349,1361641,1362901
4,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer,350,1363101,1363641
4,and then it's okay .,Marketing,351,1363841,1365041
4,So you don't have to search for your television or your code .,Marketing,351,1365241,1368961
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,352,1369161,1369521
4,It uh search uh the pattern for itself .,Marketing,353,1369721,1372121
4,"Okay ,",User Interface,354,1372321,1372681
4,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,355,1372881,1373661
4,so we use that .,User Interface,356,1373861,1374821
4,So it uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one .,Industrial Designer,357,1375021,1380721
4,Because you have to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,357,1380921,1382841
4,Yes .,Marketing,358,1383041,1383341
4,Yep .,User Interface,359,1383541,1383841
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,360,1384041,1384401
4,"I just say {disfmarker} Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking {disfmarker} There's just a short {disfmarker}",Project Manager,361,1384601,1392221
4,Uh okay .,Industrial Designer,362,1392421,1392961
4,Well uh y you have this chip .,Industrial Designer,362,1393161,1394961
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,363,1395161,1395521
4,"That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .",Industrial Designer,364,1395721,1399561
4,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,365,1399761,1400241
4,But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different .,Industrial Designer,366,1400441,1404761
4,So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one .,Industrial Designer,366,1404961,1408441
4,"And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically .",Industrial Designer,366,1408641,1411581
4,So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .,Industrial Designer,366,1411781,1415861
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,367,1416061,1416421
4,"And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .",Industrial Designer,368,1416621,1422201
4,Changing the signal .,Marketing,369,1422401,1423661
4,"And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television .",Industrial Designer,370,1423861,1431541
4,"And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting",Industrial Designer,370,1431741,1439241
4,Okay .,Project Manager,371,1439441,1439801
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,371,1440001,1440361
4,and then um it's working .,Industrial Designer,372,1440561,1442121
4,"Yeah , that's the right uh option .",Marketing,373,1442321,1444421
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,374,1444621,1444981
4,Well uh the components .,Industrial Designer,374,1445181,1446621
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,375,1446821,1447541
4,"Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time .",Industrial Designer,376,1447741,1453261
4,Um but I think I understand it .,Industrial Designer,376,1453461,1455381
4,"Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .",Industrial Designer,376,1455581,1458701
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,377,1458901,1459261
4,Um that's connecting to all the components .,Industrial Designer,378,1459461,1462101
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,379,1462301,1463021
4,Because it has to be fed with energy .,Industrial Designer,380,1463221,1465501
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,380,1465701,1466061
4,Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed .,Industrial Designer,380,1466261,1470281
4,"So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed .",Industrial Designer,380,1470481,1474081
4,Um that's connecting to a chip .,Industrial Designer,380,1474281,1476201
4,So the chip knows what button you pressed .,Industrial Designer,380,1476401,1478981
4,And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb .,Industrial Designer,380,1479181,1482781
4,I didn didn't put the description by this one .,Industrial Designer,380,1482981,1485801
4,Th this is a normal bulb .,Industrial Designer,380,1486001,1487561
4,So the normal flashing light .,Industrial Designer,380,1487761,1489561
4,Okay .,Project Manager,381,1489761,1490121
4,"So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .",Project Manager,381,1490321,1492001
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,382,1492201,1492561
4,"Yeah , and this is a LED too .",Industrial Designer,382,1492761,1494561
4,{gap},Marketing,383,1494761,1495061
4,But this one is producing infrared light,Industrial Designer,384,1495261,1497661
4,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,385,1497861,1498641
4,that's invisible .,Industrial Designer,386,1498841,1499921
4,And this one is producing normal light .,Industrial Designer,386,1500121,1502521
4,So we can make the normal one also a normal light .,Project Manager,387,1502721,1505781
4,"Not a LED light , but as a normal one .",Project Manager,387,1505981,1508321
4,To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,387,1508521,1511041
4,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,388,1511241,1512261
4,"Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works .",Marketing,389,1512461,1515941
4,But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .,Marketing,389,1516141,1519921
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,390,1520121,1520481
4,"Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah .",Industrial Designer,391,1520681,1522421

4,Yeah .,Marketing,392,1530801,1531161
4,"Yeah , and {disfmarker}",Marketing,392,1531361,1532741
4,Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push .,Project Manager,393,1532941,1537141
4,So you see green if you push that button .,Project Manager,393,1537341,1539861
4,"Huh , that's a good idea .",Industrial Designer,394,1540061,1541621
4,Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .,Marketing,395,1541821,1544881
4,"Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .",Project Manager,396,1545081,1549821
4,"No , y Yeah .",User Interface,397,1550021,1550801
4,Okay .,Marketing,398,1551001,1551361
4,And it's {disfmarker} you also know which button you p,Project Manager,399,1551561,1554801
4,But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .,Marketing,400,1555001,1559381
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,401,1559581,1560841

4,Everywhere in the r,Marketing,402,1562381,1563521
4,But does it make any difference for the energy you use ?,Project Manager,403,1563721,1567081
4,You got still one LED .,Project Manager,403,1567281,1568661

4,Yeah .,User Interface,406,1578201,1578561
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,407,1578761,1579061
4,"'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is {disfmarker}",User Interface,408,1579261,1584721
4,Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?,Marketing,409,1584921,1587081

4,n n Yeah .,Industrial Designer,414,1598101,1598701
4,You have your finger over the button .,Industrial Designer,414,1598901,1601181
4,So you can see {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,414,1601381,1603001
4,It must be around it then .,Marketing,415,1603201,1604821
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,416,1605021,1605381
4,Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing,Industrial Designer,416,1605581,1609541

5,Okay .,Project Manager,127,393201,393561
5,Okay .,Project Manager,127,393761,394121
5,Um uh,Project Manager,127,394321,394621
5,but {disfmarker},Marketing,128,394821,395781
5,okay .,Project Manager,129,395981,396341
5,Do you have {gap} {disfmarker} uh thit {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker},Project Manager,129,396541,400921
5,'Kay .,Marketing,130,401121,401481
5,Uh that's about it .,Marketing,130,401681,402881
5,Okay .,Project Manager,131,403081,403441
5,"{vocalsound} Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the {disfmarker} our target group .",Project Manager,131,403641,412461
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,132,412661,413381
5,Yes .,Marketing,133,413581,413881
5,And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .,Project Manager,134,414081,417501
5,Uh soft material .,Marketing,135,417701,418781
5,Okay .,Project Manager,136,418981,419341
5,"So {disfmarker} So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important .",Industrial Designer,137,419541,424581
5,And what was even more important ?,Industrial Designer,137,424781,426821
5,Uh the fancy look and feel .,Marketing,138,427021,428701
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,139,428901,429261
5,So that's the most important thing for our customers .,Industrial Designer,139,429461,432701
5,Yes .,Marketing,140,432901,433201
5,Apparently .,Marketing,140,433401,434121
5,"Okay , Roo ,",Project Manager,141,434321,435041
5,Yeah .,User Interface,142,435241,435601
5,could you do your presentation ?,Project Manager,143,435801,437721
5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,144,437921,438401
5,"Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion .",User Interface,144,438601,445801
5,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,144,446001,446901
5,"Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .",Project Manager,145,447101,451601
5,{vocalsound} Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume .,User Interface,146,451801,459601
5,"Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these .",User Interface,146,459801,463821
5,"These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .",User Interface,146,464021,472721
5,Shape .,Project Manager,147,472921,473341
5,So I suggest {disfmarker} I couldn't uh {disfmarker} I had a small uh mock-up uh {vocalsound} sign on the {vocalsound} on {gap} paper .,User Interface,148,473541,481641
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,149,481841,482561
5,{vocalsound} But it didn't work .,User Interface,150,482761,484741
5,My pen didn't load um the information .,User Interface,150,484941,487281
5,So I made a really simple {vocalsound} f uh a shape on uh {disfmarker} in um PowerPoint .,User Interface,150,487481,492821
5,But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control .,User Interface,150,493021,496741
5,Uh yellow .,User Interface,150,496941,497601
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,151,497801,498281
5,"But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .",Industrial Designer,151,498481,502741
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,152,502941,503301
5,Yeah .,Marketing,153,503501,503861
5,"And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .",Project Manager,154,504061,512701
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,155,512901,513201
5,"Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,",Project Manager,156,513401,516281
5,Slippery .,Industrial Designer,157,516481,517081
5,s because um {disfmarker},Project Manager,158,517281,518781
5,"But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .",User Interface,159,518981,523001
5,You have to grab it .,Industrial Designer,160,523201,524461
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,161,524661,525021
5,"Yeah , exactly .",Project Manager,161,525221,526181
5,So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .,User Interface,162,526381,529381
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,163,529581,529941
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,164,530141,530441
5,"There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,",Industrial Designer,164,530641,537481
5,"Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .",Project Manager,165,537681,539781
5,Yeah .,User Interface,166,539981,540341
5,so you can get a really good grip on it .,Industrial Designer,167,540541,543001
5,So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it .,Industrial Designer,167,543201,546561
5,It's it's a lot easier .,Industrial Designer,167,546761,548201
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,168,548401,548761
5,It grips automatically .,Project Manager,168,548961,550401
5,"Yeah , {vocalsound}",Project Manager,168,550601,551741
5,So m Yes .,Industrial Designer,169,551941,552541
5,okay .,Project Manager,170,552741,553101
5,But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .,Industrial Designer,171,553301,556541
5,"Okay , good .",Project Manager,172,556741,557521
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,173,557721,558441
5,Great .,User Interface,174,558641,559061
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,174,559261,559981
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,175,560181,560901
5,"Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .",User Interface,176,561101,575621
5,And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .,User Interface,176,575821,580441
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,177,580641,581001
5,"Way too much I think for our goal ,",Project Manager,177,581201,583301
5,Yeah .,User Interface,178,583501,583861
5,yeah .,Project Manager,179,584061,584421
5,"So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .",User Interface,180,584621,592061
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,181,592261,592981
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,182,593181,593901
5,"Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}",Project Manager,183,594101,596441
5,"Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,",Industrial Designer,184,596641,598741
5,yeah .,Project Manager,185,598941,599301
5,because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .,Industrial Designer,186,599501,603521
5,"Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design .",Industrial Designer,186,603721,612061
5,Uh these are the things we've looked at .,Industrial Designer,186,612261,614721
5,And of course I used the web to uh find my information .,Industrial Designer,186,614921,618281
5,"About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities .",Industrial Designer,186,618481,622381
5,We have the uncurved or flat case .,Industrial Designer,186,622581,624681
5,Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box .,Industrial Designer,186,624881,631841
5,I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .,Industrial Designer,186,632041,635581
5,{vocalsound} We have uh a curved one .,Industrial Designer,186,635781,638061
5,It's uh curved in two dimensions .,Industrial Designer,186,638261,640301
5,You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form .,Industrial Designer,186,640501,643441
5,So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .,Industrial Designer,186,643641,646941
5,Okay .,Project Manager,187,647141,647501
5,"Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension .",Industrial Designer,188,647701,652741
5,I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation .,Industrial Designer,188,652941,659181
5,"The the big remote control , something like that .",Industrial Designer,188,659381,662381
5,Yeah .,User Interface,189,662581,662941
5,Right .,User Interface,189,663141,663561
5,But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think .,Industrial Designer,190,663761,668141
5,Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing .,Industrial Designer,190,668341,672061
5,"We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery .",Industrial Designer,190,672261,681921
5,We can use wood and titanium .,Industrial Designer,190,682121,683921
5,"Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .",Industrial Designer,190,684121,687961
5,"And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source .",Industrial Designer,190,688161,696621
5,Which brings me to the different energy sources .,Industrial Designer,190,696821,699761
5,"{vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .",Industrial Designer,190,699961,706981

5,{vocalsound},User Interface,192,708101,708821
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,193,709021,709741
5,You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer,194,709941,714501
5,{vocalsound} Great .,User Interface,195,714701,715901
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,195,716101,716821
5,"Well , it would be very new to the market ,",Project Manager,196,717021,719601
5,I d,Industrial Designer,197,719801,719981
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,198,720181,720901
5,but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,199,721101,722841
5,"It would be very new ,",Industrial Designer,200,723041,724361
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,201,724561,725281
5,"but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .",Industrial Designer,202,725481,728301
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,203,728501,728861
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,203,729061,729781
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,204,729981,730701
5,"Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well ,",Industrial Designer,205,730901,733001
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,206,733201,733921
5,this is quite interesting .,Industrial Designer,207,734121,735741
5,Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply .,Industrial Designer,207,735941,738881
5,"So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're {disfmarker} you you have to um make some kind of energy {disfmarker} kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .",Industrial Designer,207,739081,751681
5,Like the watch .,User Interface,208,751881,752841
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,209,753041,753761
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,210,753961,754681
5,"{vocalsound} It have {disfmarker} it it has to move , that's the the sense of it .",Industrial Designer,211,754881,759801
5,And you can store the energy in the in the thing .,Industrial Designer,211,760001,763001
5,"I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .",Project Manager,212,763201,767941
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,213,768141,768621
5,It's very funny indeed .,Industrial Designer,213,768821,770261
5,"I mean solar is {disfmarker} of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .",Project Manager,214,770461,777181
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,215,777381,777861
5,Indeed .,Industrial Designer,215,778061,778541
5,Um hand dynamo {disfmarker},Project Manager,216,778741,780361
5,"But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}",User Interface,217,780561,786741
5,"Well , maybe m",Project Manager,218,786941,787781
5,"if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .",User Interface,219,787981,792421
5,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,220,792621,793521
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,221,793721,794201
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,221,794401,794701
5,You you walk,User Interface,222,794901,795621
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,223,795821,796181
5,and uh {disfmarker} but uh you {disfmarker} you're sitting on a couch .,User Interface,224,796381,800641
5,But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .,Industrial Designer,225,800841,808521
5,"{gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it .",Industrial Designer,225,808721,815681
5,But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .,Industrial Designer,225,815881,821221
5,"So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,",Industrial Designer,225,821421,834201
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,226,834401,834761
5,And wha,Project Manager,226,834961,835381
5,"well , m it might not work .",Industrial Designer,227,835581,837261
5,So that's something you have to keep in mind .,Industrial Designer,227,837461,840221
5,Okay .,Project Manager,228,840421,840781
5,"So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries",Industrial Designer,229,840981,849321
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,230,849521,849881
5,"and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .",Industrial Designer,231,850081,856561
5,"Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .",Project Manager,232,856761,862341
5,"Uh yes , it does .",Industrial Designer,233,862541,863621
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,234,863821,864181
5,I'll come to that later .,Industrial Designer,235,864381,865881
5,Okay .,Project Manager,236,866081,866441
5,"And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .",Industrial Designer,237,866641,877021
5,"{vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels .",Industrial Designer,237,877221,884181
5,And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .,Industrial Designer,237,884381,888041
5,So it's just like a mouse .,Industrial Designer,237,888241,889861
5,"You can scroll 'em , you can also push it .",Industrial Designer,237,890061,892641
5,"Um {vocalsound} uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,237,892841,906521
5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,238,906721,907201
5,"uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things .",Industrial Designer,239,907401,912201
5,"So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,239,912401,921761
5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,240,921961,922441
5,"Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .",User Interface,240,922641,926361
5,{vocalsound} Yes .,Industrial Designer,241,926561,927641
5,That is possible too .,Industrial Designer,241,927841,929161
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,241,929361,929661
5,{gap} {disfmarker} But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels {disfmarker} I had some {disfmarker} I had some information about it too .,User Interface,242,929861,938081
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,243,938281,938761
5,I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .,User Interface,244,938961,943761
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,245,943961,944981
5,I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .,User Interface,246,945181,950641
5,"Well , mayb uh well , m me neither .",Industrial Designer,247,950841,953001
5,Maybe when you integrate some functions .,Industrial Designer,247,953201,955661
5,"This will be the remote , right ?",Project Manager,248,955861,957841
5,Yeah .,User Interface,249,958041,958401
5,Um with uh maybe a channel selector .,Project Manager,250,958601,960821
5,What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?,Project Manager,250,961021,964021
5,"Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,",User Interface,251,964221,966141
5,Uh it's do it's done before .,Industrial Designer,252,966341,968081
5,Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker},Project Manager,253,968281,970921
5,but {disfmarker},User Interface,254,971121,972081
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,255,972281,972581
5,"It's quite quite good , yes .",Industrial Designer,255,972781,974521
5,"But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for {disfmarker}",User Interface,256,974721,980601
5,Volume ?,Project Manager,257,980801,981281
5,"Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .",Industrial Designer,258,981481,988501
5,"A volume , okay .",User Interface,259,988701,989721
5,There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel .,Industrial Designer,260,989921,994061
5,You just use the wheel .,Industrial Designer,260,994261,995701
5,"Well , what about mute ?",Project Manager,261,995901,997341
5,About mute .,Industrial Designer,262,997541,998261
5,Thi i i m I guess uh th,Project Manager,263,998461,999841
5,"Well , yes .",Industrial Designer,264,1000041,1000761
5,this is my volume button .,Project Manager,265,1000961,1002521
5,And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker},Project Manager,265,1002721,1006201

5,"Well , okay .",Industrial Designer,266,1007461,1008241
5,"Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .",Industrial Designer,266,1008441,1011321
5,And click it to muten the device .,Project Manager,267,1011521,1013561
5,"Well , okay .",Industrial Designer,268,1013761,1014541
5,It's quite goods .,Industrial Designer,268,1014741,1015821
5,And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market .,Project Manager,269,1016021,1020701
5,So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .,Project Manager,269,1020901,1026001
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,270,1026201,1026681
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,270,1026881,1027181
5,So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .,Project Manager,271,1027381,1033381
5,Yeah .,User Interface,272,1033581,1033941
5,"Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ?",Project Manager,273,1034141,1037441
5,Uh scroll-wheel .,Project Manager,273,1037641,1038661
5,"Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,",Marketing,274,1038861,1041141
5,Wheel .,User Interface,275,1041341,1041761
5,it's obvious obviously new .,Marketing,276,1041961,1043641
5,So it might attract uh the young customers .,Marketing,276,1043841,1046481
5,Okay .,Project Manager,277,1046681,1047041
5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,278,1047241,1047541
5,"{vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios .",Industrial Designer,278,1047741,1055181
5,We use this .,Industrial Designer,278,1055381,1056161
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,279,1056361,1056721
5,"And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .",Industrial Designer,280,1056921,1062141
5,"Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .",Project Manager,281,1062341,1066301
5,So maybe it's not no {gap} .,Industrial Designer,282,1066501,1068181
5,"Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .",Project Manager,283,1068381,1078401
5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,284,1078601,1078901
5,"Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .",Industrial Designer,284,1079101,1081501
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,285,1081701,1082061
5,"I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel .",Project Manager,285,1082261,1084721
5,No .,Project Manager,285,1084921,1085161
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,285,1085361,1085721
5,It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} .,Industrial Designer,286,1085921,1088141
5,Well .,Industrial Designer,286,1088341,1088701
5,Uh something for uh Roo here .,Industrial Designer,286,1088901,1090701
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,286,1090901,1091621
5,"For you too , yeah .",Project Manager,287,1091821,1093021
5,"Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control .",User Interface,288,1093221,1099761
5,"You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .",User Interface,288,1099961,1107101
5,Wi within reach .,Industrial Designer,289,1107301,1108321
5,"Yes , you have to .",Industrial Designer,289,1108521,1109661
5,So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .,User Interface,290,1109861,1115381
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,291,1115581,1115881
5,{gap} yes .,Industrial Designer,291,1116081,1116741
5,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,291,1116941,1117721
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,291,1117921,1118281
5,Okay .,Project Manager,292,1118481,1118841
5,Sebastian .,Project Manager,292,1119041,1119701
5,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,292,1119901,1120801
5,"Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons .",Industrial Designer,293,1121001,1128981
5,There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays .,Industrial Designer,293,1129181,1132181
5,"There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .",Industrial Designer,293,1132381,1136821
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,294,1137021,1137381
5,There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things .,Industrial Designer,295,1137581,1142861
5,So that's a limitation .,Industrial Designer,295,1143061,1144501
5,"{vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware .",Industrial Designer,295,1144701,1148361
5,We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal .,Industrial Designer,295,1148561,1158461
5,"Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .",Industrial Designer,295,1158661,1161601
5,"And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me .",Industrial Designer,295,1161801,1167861
5,But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .,Industrial Designer,295,1168061,1172981
5,"{vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it .",User Interface,296,1173181,1178161
5,Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up .,User Interface,296,1178361,1184601
5,"Of mute , let's say mute .",User Interface,296,1184801,1186361
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,297,1186561,1187041
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,297,1187241,1187601
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,297,1187801,1188161
5,So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,297,1188361,1190221
5,"Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function",User Interface,298,1190421,1197201
5,okay .,Industrial Designer,299,1197401,1197761
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,300,1197961,1198681
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,301,1198881,1199361
5,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,301,1199561,1199921
5,"and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying .",User Interface,302,1200121,1204741
5,that's the sample sensor .,User Interface,302,1204941,1206501
5,"So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,",User Interface,302,1206701,1209341
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,303,1209541,1209901
5,"and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,304,1210101,1214121
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,305,1214321,1214801
5,It performs the action .,Project Manager,306,1215001,1216441
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,306,1216641,1217001
5,"Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .",User Interface,307,1217201,1222421
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,308,1222621,1222981
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,309,1223181,1223541
5,"So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .",User Interface,310,1223741,1231001
5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,311,1231201,1232341
5,"Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for .",Industrial Designer,311,1232541,1237401
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,311,1237601,1237961
5,"This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought .",Industrial Designer,311,1238161,1241761
5,Um no op I'm not very sure .,Industrial Designer,311,1241961,1243641
5,"No , it's not in here .",Industrial Designer,311,1243841,1245221
5,"If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly .",Industrial Designer,311,1245421,1252501
5,If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version .,Industrial Designer,311,1252701,1256601
5,"And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .",Industrial Designer,311,1256801,1264781
5,Okay .,Project Manager,312,1264981,1265341
5,Uh well {disfmarker} uh,Project Manager,312,1265541,1266921
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,313,1267121,1267481
5,d did we already decide on the display ?,Project Manager,314,1267681,1270081
5,To {disfmarker},Project Manager,314,1270281,1271181
5,"Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .",Industrial Designer,315,1271381,1275521
5,Yeah .,User Interface,316,1275721,1276081
5,"Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display .",User Interface,316,1276281,1286781
5,No .,Project Manager,317,1286981,1287221
5,"Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,318,1287421,1292101
5,I I don't think either .,Industrial Designer,319,1292301,1293741
5,"'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,",User Interface,320,1293941,1299281
5,No .,Industrial Designer,321,1299481,1299721
5,I don't think you need it .,Industrial Designer,321,1299921,1301541
5,On screen display .,Project Manager,322,1301741,1302881
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,322,1303081,1303441
5,yeah .,User Interface,323,1303641,1304001
5,Okay,Project Manager,324,1304201,1304441
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,325,1304641,1305001
5,"Okay , well",Industrial Designer,325,1305201,1305861
5,th,Project Manager,326,1306061,1306181
5,"my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought .",Industrial Designer,327,1306381,1312801
5,"I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff .",Industrial Designer,327,1313001,1319781
5,So maybe we should think about uh wood finish .,Industrial Designer,327,1319981,1322801
5,Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy .,Industrial Designer,327,1323001,1327561
5,"It's more reliable , it's cheaper .",Industrial Designer,327,1327761,1329861
5,Okay .,Project Manager,328,1330061,1330421
5,Good .,Project Manager,328,1330621,1330981
5,So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing .,Industrial Designer,329,1331181,1334121
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,329,1334321,1335041
5,Kineti okay .,Project Manager,330,1335241,1336021
5,The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility .,Industrial Designer,331,1336221,1339341
5,"It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .",Industrial Designer,331,1339541,1345121
5,"Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,",Project Manager,332,1345321,1347721
5,"Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,",Industrial Designer,333,1347921,1350861
5,too {disfmarker},Project Manager,334,1351061,1352021
5,uh well .,Industrial Designer,335,1352221,1352761
5,yeah .,Project Manager,336,1352961,1353321
5,"It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .",Industrial Designer,337,1353521,1359821
5,"Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell .",Project Manager,338,1360021,1363981
5,That's no different .,Project Manager,338,1364181,1365441
5,But {disfmarker} Yes .,Industrial Designer,339,1365641,1366961
5,And I think it's more robust .,Industrial Designer,339,1367161,1368961
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,340,1369161,1369521
5,Okay .,Project Manager,340,1369721,1370081
5,It's more uh Uh it's more functional .,Industrial Designer,341,1370281,1372561
5,But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ?,User Interface,342,1372761,1377261
5,So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,342,1377461,1380341
5,"No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said .",Project Manager,343,1380541,1384321
5,The titanium thing uh we have to skip it .,Industrial Designer,344,1384521,1387041
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,344,1387241,1387961
5,He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference .,Project Manager,345,1388161,1391701
5,"But but yet , I understood that the market is different .",Project Manager,345,1391901,1395321
5,Okay .,User Interface,346,1395521,1395881
5,"Oh ,",User Interface,346,1396081,1396321
5,So um {disfmarker},Project Manager,347,1396521,1397601
5,sorry .,User Interface,348,1397801,1398221
5,Yeah .,User Interface,348,1398421,1398781
5,"So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,",Industrial Designer,349,1398981,1401921
5,Yeah .,User Interface,350,1402121,1402481
5,and we should uh use wood or something like that .,Industrial Designer,351,1402681,1405681
5,"No ,",Project Manager,352,1405881,1406121
5,And I would think {disfmarker},User Interface,353,1406321,1408121
5,And,Marketing,354,1408321,1408501
5,r,Project Manager,355,1408701,1408761
5,"yeah ,",Marketing,356,1408961,1409321
5,rubber with colours .,Project Manager,357,1409521,1410781
5,"the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood .",Marketing,358,1410981,1414161
5,"Oh okay , sorry .",Industrial Designer,359,1414361,1415381
5,So it it needs to be rubber .,Industrial Designer,359,1415581,1417321
5,No the {disfmarker},Marketing,360,1417521,1418661
5,Colourful and {disfmarker},Project Manager,361,1418861,1420421
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,362,1420621,1420981
5,"Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .",Marketing,363,1421181,1424001
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,364,1424201,1424561
5,"Okay , spongy materials .",Industrial Designer,365,1424761,1426261
5,Yeah .,Marketing,366,1426461,1426821
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,366,1427021,1427741
5,"Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .",Industrial Designer,367,1427941,1433161
5,And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?,User Interface,368,1433361,1436301
5,"So {disfmarker} Yes , they can .",Industrial Designer,369,1436501,1438421
5,"But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,369,1438621,1443481
5,"Okay , but we also {disfmarker} uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker {disfmarker}",User Interface,370,1443681,1450461
5,"Well , I'm not very sure .",Industrial Designer,371,1450661,1452221
5,Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,371,1452421,1455781
5,"oh ,",User Interface,372,1455981,1456221
5,"But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,",Project Manager,373,1456421,1459061
5,evalu,User Interface,374,1459261,1459561
5,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,375,1459761,1460661
5,"{gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .",Industrial Designer,376,1460861,1468121
5,I it's too dull .,Project Manager,377,1468321,1469341
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,377,1469541,1469901
5,I don't think c our customers will like it .,Industrial Designer,378,1470101,1472741
5,Yeah .,Marketing,379,1472941,1473301
5,"And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .",Industrial Designer,380,1473501,1482561
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,381,1482761,1483121
5,Okay .,Project Manager,381,1483321,1483681
5,Okay .,Project Manager,381,1483881,1484241
5,So I think this is the best of two worlds .,Industrial Designer,382,1484441,1487021
5,"Okay , what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ?",Project Manager,383,1487221,1492741
5,Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue .,Project Manager,383,1492941,1496061
5,Because it it's of cour,Project Manager,383,1496261,1497641
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,384,1497841,1498141
5,It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .,Industrial Designer,384,1498341,1505661
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,385,1505861,1506221
5,It's very unlogical .,Industrial Designer,386,1506421,1507681
5,{vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .,User Interface,387,1507881,1512861
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,388,1513061,1514081
5,Well the there has to be some pointing at .,Industrial Designer,389,1514281,1516861
5,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,389,1517061,1518021
5,It depends also on your on your {disfmarker},Project Manager,390,1518221,1520861
5,"Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just {vocalsound} to the other wall .",User Interface,391,1521061,1528801
5,"Well , it depends on your walls actually .",Project Manager,392,1529001,1531521
5,"If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably {disfmarker} you're probably right .",Project Manager,392,1531721,1537241
5,Yeah .,User Interface,393,1537441,1537801
5,"But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um {disfmarker} yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .",Project Manager,394,1538001,1547541
5,"All lights get absorbed , yeah .",Industrial Designer,395,1547741,1549661
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,395,1549861,1550581
5,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,396,1550781,1551681

5,There {disfmarker} the icons .,Marketing,557,2048761,2050561
5,"The scroll-wheel , I mean .",Project Manager,558,2050761,2052381
5,And you could place the indica th th the signals the {disfmarker},Project Manager,558,2052581,2056481
5,"Yeah , b yeah .",User Interface,559,2056681,2057581
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,560,2057781,2058081
5,"Yeah , that's possible ,",User Interface,561,2058281,2059721
5,That's okay .,Industrial Designer,562,2059921,2060701
5,So you don't touch the icons that much .,Marketing,563,2060901,2063301
5,but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .,User Interface,564,2063501,2067221
5,"So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .",User Interface,564,2067421,2075041
5,"No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or {disfmarker} But it's into the rubber .",Project Manager,565,2075241,2080461
5,Yeah .,User Interface,566,2080661,2081021
5,"Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .",User Interface,566,2081221,2083741
5,"Yeah , but this is on the pla",Project Manager,567,2083941,2085681
5,You have to draw the {disfmarker},User Interface,568,2085881,2087861
5,"Yes , the signs .",Industrial Designer,569,2088061,2089081
5,"yeah , I know .",Project Manager,570,2089281,2090181
5,Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .,Project Manager,570,2090381,2094581
5,"Yeah , it's on the cover .",User Interface,571,2094781,2096341
5,So if you uh {disfmarker} You just move the problem .,User Interface,571,2096541,2099721
5,What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?,Project Manager,572,2099921,2103401
5,Uh I see what you mean .,Industrial Designer,573,2103601,2105041
5,"Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing .",Industrial Designer,573,2105241,2111421
5,So maybe they can combine these two .,Industrial Designer,573,2111621,2113841
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,574,2114041,2114401
5,"Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess .",Project Manager,574,2114601,2118561
5,A plastic cover with rubber finishing .,Project Manager,574,2118761,2121101

5,"I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber .",Industrial Designer,581,2139181,2152501
5,"So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .",Industrial Designer,581,2152701,2157861
5,"{vocalsound} I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?",Project Manager,582,2158061,2162021

6,Sorry .,User Interface,15,32821,33241
6,"Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone .",Project Manager,16,33441,41121
6,"We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .",Project Manager,16,41321,49661

6,Yep .,User Interface,27,108421,108721
6,Yep there we go .,Industrial Designer,28,108921,109941
6,"Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .",Industrial Designer,28,110141,116021
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,29,116221,116941
6,"'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so .",Industrial Designer,30,117141,120621
6,What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ?,Industrial Designer,30,120821,126701
6,"Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .",Industrial Designer,30,126901,143461
6,"Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that .",Industrial Designer,30,143661,150681
6,"But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really .",Industrial Designer,30,150881,166001
6,"So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,30,166201,171841
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,31,172041,172761
6,"Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information .",Industrial Designer,32,172961,189101
6,"Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .",Industrial Designer,32,189301,192601
6,"Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .",Industrial Designer,32,192801,209061
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,33,209261,209741
6,"Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,",Marketing,33,209941,213661
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,34,213861,214341
6,Yeah sure .,Industrial Designer,35,214541,215201
6,is that appropriate ?,Marketing,36,215401,216661
6,You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?,Marketing,36,216861,221481
6,"Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,",Industrial Designer,37,221681,230861
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,38,231061,231541
6,they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .,Industrial Designer,39,231741,236001
6,"Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?",Marketing,40,236201,240641
6,Yeah the the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,41,240841,242341
6,Okay .,User Interface,42,242541,242901
6,They are .,Project Manager,43,243101,243701
6,well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption,Industrial Designer,44,243901,250081
6,Oh I see .,Marketing,45,250281,250881
6,and how much you need to send the data across .,Industrial Designer,46,251081,253901
6,Okay .,Marketing,47,254101,254461
6,"Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .",Industrial Designer,48,254661,260541
6,"Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .",Industrial Designer,48,260741,267461
6,"{vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine .",Industrial Designer,48,267661,303601
6,And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer .,Industrial Designer,48,303801,311781
6,And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .,Industrial Designer,48,311981,315881
6,{gap},User Interface,49,316081,316381
6,"It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment .",Industrial Designer,50,316581,360021
6,"And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good .",Industrial Designer,50,360221,371861
6,"Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,",Industrial Designer,50,372061,394741
6,Mm .,Marketing,51,394941,395181
6,Mm .,Marketing,51,395381,395621

6,{gap} okay .,User Interface,74,449281,450001
6,"Oh , there {gap} .",Project Manager,75,450201,451281
6,Yeah .,User Interface,76,451481,451841
6,"Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,",User Interface,76,452041,456721
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,77,456921,457281
6,"but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .",User Interface,78,457481,478601
6,"So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible .",User Interface,78,478801,486661
6,"And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .",User Interface,78,486861,507621
6,"But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together .",User Interface,78,507821,514001
6,So what the concept is to have a flip-top model .,User Interface,78,514201,517141
6,"The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .",User Interface,78,517341,535281
6,So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people .,User Interface,78,535481,549221
6,Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user .,User Interface,78,549421,574921
6,As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ?,User Interface,78,575121,583161
6,"Yeah ,",User Interface,78,583361,583721
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,79,583921,584281
6,"with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly .",User Interface,80,584481,593241
6,"Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that .",User Interface,80,593441,614321
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,81,614521,614881
6,So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .,User Interface,82,615081,618201

6,"Yeah , you might .",Project Manager,114,679401,680481
6,"yeah , there you go .",Industrial Designer,115,680681,681941
6,"Get it right over , okay , thank you .",Marketing,116,682141,684421
6,Ah .,Project Manager,117,684621,684861
6,Look at that .,Project Manager,117,685061,685901
6,"Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .",Marketing,118,686101,696421
6,"{vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .",Marketing,118,696621,719061
6,"{vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here .",Marketing,118,719261,724481
6,"The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there .",Marketing,118,724681,735481
6,"Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .",Marketing,118,735681,740541
6,"Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .",Marketing,118,740741,757841
6,"Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .",Marketing,118,758041,763861
6,"For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,",Marketing,118,764061,768921
6,Yeah .,User Interface,119,769121,769481
6,so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .,Marketing,120,769681,773581
6,So again there's power implications there .,Marketing,120,773781,776361
6,"{vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .",Marketing,120,776561,783401
6,Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control .,Marketing,120,783601,790321
6,"Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .",Marketing,120,790521,808461
6,"Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions .",Marketing,120,808661,824741
6,"Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .",Marketing,120,824941,830701
6,You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .,Marketing,120,830901,837021
6,"Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .",Marketing,120,837221,852341
6,"Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly .",Marketing,120,852541,864061
6,"Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups .",Marketing,120,864261,867261
6,"So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .",Marketing,120,867461,879221

6,Okay .,Industrial Designer,127,894281,894641
6,is that okay ?,Marketing,128,894841,895681
6,"Right , um",Project Manager,129,895881,896481
6,Huh .,Industrial Designer,130,896681,896981

6,Okay .,User Interface,132,901941,902301
6,um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now .,Project Manager,133,902501,906821
6,"Um {vocalsound} our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it limits the cost for us ,",Project Manager,133,907021,919561
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,134,919761,920241
6,but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .,Project Manager,135,920441,924041
6,"Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?",Marketing,136,924241,928261

6,Just channel-hopping .,Marketing,138,933041,934361
6,"yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but {vocalsound} I don't know , what do you think ?",Project Manager,139,934561,942061
6,"It just said , for T_V_ only .",Project Manager,139,942261,944061

6,Would that imply video use ?,Marketing,140,947821,949501
6,T yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer,141,949701,950481
6,I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g,Industrial Designer,141,950681,953321
6,I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?,Project Manager,142,953521,958261
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,143,958461,958821
6,If yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,143,959021,960221
6,"Mm-hmm , yes .",Marketing,144,960421,961261
6,"and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .",Industrial Designer,145,961461,971361
6,Mm .,Project Manager,146,971561,971801
6,I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming .,Project Manager,146,972001,977521
6,{vocalsound} Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?,User Interface,147,977721,985881
6,Yes .,Marketing,148,986081,986381
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,149,986581,986941

6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,155,1004581,1004941

6,Okay .,User Interface,157,1012061,1012421
6,Hmm .,Project Manager,158,1012621,1012921
6,Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing,Industrial Designer,159,1013121,1021941
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,160,1022141,1022621
6,Pens,User Interface,161,1022821,1023061
6,and they're not that great anyway .,Industrial Designer,162,1023261,1025361

6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,168,1049801,1050281
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,169,1050481,1050841

6,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,171,1058261,1058621
6,Yeah but um on on that again I just thought {disfmarker} 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is,Industrial Designer,172,1058821,1069381

6,Right .,Marketing,177,1074341,1074761
6,"We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing",Project Manager,178,1074961,1083781
6,Mm .,Marketing,179,1083981,1084221
6,"um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,",Project Manager,180,1084421,1094921
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,181,1095121,1095481
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,181,1095681,1096041
6,"maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps",Project Manager,182,1096241,1107281
6,Okay .,User Interface,183,1107481,1107841

6,Yes .,Marketing,186,1112581,1112881
6,That's a super idea .,Marketing,186,1113081,1114341

6,Yeah .,Marketing,189,1119221,1119581
6,Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .,Project Manager,190,1119781,1127341

6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,393,1924761,1925121
6,"Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .",Project Manager,394,1925321,1928621
6,Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,395,1928821,1941841
6,"Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay .",Project Manager,396,1942041,1945101

7,Sure .,Industrial Designer,17,54301,54661
7,Okay .,Project Manager,18,54861,55221
7,So I've been looking at the components design .,Industrial Designer,19,55421,58241
7,Um .,Industrial Designer,19,58441,58681
7,Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .,Industrial Designer,19,58881,66861
7,"Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard .",Industrial Designer,19,67061,72101
7,"Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .",Industrial Designer,19,72301,80941
7,"And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .",Industrial Designer,19,81141,91581
7,But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out .,Industrial Designer,19,91781,97841
7,"Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel .",Industrial Designer,19,98041,102961
7,The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it .,Industrial Designer,19,103161,108621
7,"Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard .",Industrial Designer,19,108821,112601
7,And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .,Industrial Designer,19,112801,118381
7,So we have some material options .,Industrial Designer,19,118581,120621
7,"Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .",Industrial Designer,19,120821,124001
7,"Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .",Industrial Designer,19,124201,130501
7,"Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .",Industrial Designer,19,130701,138321
7,And why not wood ?,Project Manager,20,138521,139601

7,"{vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood .",Industrial Designer,23,144141,146541
7,{vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to .,Industrial Designer,23,146741,149381

7,Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .,Project Manager,68,389701,392041

7,You need a screen for it ?,Project Manager,70,401921,403481

7,that was one of th I I was {disfmarker},Project Manager,76,435401,437741
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,77,437941,438301
7,Okay .,User Interface,78,438501,438861
7,"sorry ,",Project Manager,79,439061,439481

7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,86,451681,452041
7,That correct ?,Marketing,87,452241,453081
7,So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay .,User Interface,88,453281,464381
7,So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ?,User Interface,88,464581,467341

7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,98,539261,540461

7,I oh yeah ?,User Interface,104,554441,555101
7,But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels .,Project Manager,105,555301,559681
7,Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager,105,559881,563661
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,106,563861,564581
7,'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker},User Interface,107,564781,567121
7,Yeah .,Marketing,108,567321,567681
7,They have to r wheel really fast .,Industrial Designer,109,567881,569921

7,at least on theirs .,Industrial Designer,115,580861,582061
7,"Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different",User Interface,116,582261,607701
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,117,607901,608261
7,"uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels .",User Interface,118,608461,616201
7,Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth,User Interface,118,616401,621861
7,Right .,Project Manager,119,622061,622481

7,Yeah .,Project Manager,125,666581,666941

8,"Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you {gap} other functions .",Industrial Designer,20,65641,70501
8,{vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .,User Interface,21,70701,74001
8,Maybe that's better .,Project Manager,22,74201,75461
8,"Yeah , that's that's a very good point .",Project Manager,22,75661,78061
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,23,78261,78621

8,"Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there .",Industrial Designer,44,136641,139461
8,Simply a square with uh round corners .,Industrial Designer,44,139661,142001
8,So that's basically it .,Industrial Designer,44,142201,143641
8,{vocalsound} Uh the material should be hard plastic .,Industrial Designer,44,143841,147021
8,"Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .",Industrial Designer,44,147221,149921
8,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,45,150121,150601

8,Um I didn't have a specification of that .,User Interface,57,195621,198141
8,But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .,User Interface,57,198341,202481
8,Uh I dunno .,Industrial Designer,58,202681,203401
8,Um so I've {disfmarker},User Interface,59,203601,204981

8,"Okay , next .",Marketing,409,1224441,1225221
8,"This is a difficult one , because we we don't {disfmarker} Yeah , we don't know it about the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,410,1225421,1231721
8,{vocalsound} Learnable ?,Marketing,411,1231921,1233361
8,Easy to use ?,Marketing,411,1233561,1234341
8,"Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,411,1234541,1237901

8,Yeah .,User Interface,413,1243641,1244001
8,It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker},Project Manager,414,1244201,1246421

8,No .,Project Manager,418,1253461,1253701
8,That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .,Industrial Designer,419,1253901,1257321
8,"So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker}",User Interface,420,1257521,1262441
8,Learnable ?,Marketing,421,1262641,1263301
8,It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .,Marketing,421,1263501,1266741
8,"Well , I think it is .",Industrial Designer,422,1266941,1268261
8,"Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .",Marketing,423,1268461,1278061
8,Well y just uh f,User Interface,424,1278261,1279221
8,"I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or",Marketing,425,1279421,1282661
8,"But the rest of it is very easy ,",Project Manager,426,1282861,1284841
8,{disfmarker} Uh then the re,Marketing,427,1285041,1286661
8,because there are so so n,Project Manager,428,1286861,1288361
8,"Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .",User Interface,429,1288561,1291501
8,So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .,Industrial Designer,430,1291701,1296681
8,Yes .,User Interface,431,1296881,1297181
8,Yeah .,Marketing,432,1297381,1297741

8,Okay .,Marketing,434,1303001,1303361
8,So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .,Project Manager,435,1303561,1307761
8,Okay .,Marketing,436,1307961,1308321
8,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker},User Interface,437,1308521,1311701
8,But {disfmarker},Marketing,438,1311901,1312861

8,Device .,User Interface,441,1325181,1325661
8,And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls .,Marketing,442,1325861,1330901
8,"So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide .",Marketing,442,1331101,1335481
8,You must slide it .,Marketing,442,1335681,1336821
8,And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .,Marketing,442,1337021,1340381
8,But {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,443,1340581,1341961
8,'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use .,Marketing,444,1342161,1346541
8,Okay .,User Interface,445,1346741,1347101

9,Mm .,Project Manager,205,595641,595881

9,"Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .",Industrial Designer,247,752061,769341

9,I presume it would .,Marketing,306,968981,970181
9,I would {disfmarker},Project Manager,307,970381,971581
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,308,971781,972141
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,308,972341,972701
9,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,309,972901,974101
9,it would probably .,Project Manager,310,974301,975441
9,I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .,Project Manager,310,975641,978701
9,"They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,",Project Manager,310,978901,986821
9,Right .,Marketing,311,987021,987441
9,so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .,Project Manager,312,987641,990581
9,Okay .,Marketing,313,990781,991141
9,"Okay , so let's break it up there .",Project Manager,314,991341,993441
9,Okay ?,Project Manager,314,993641,994001
9,Okay .,Industrial Designer,315,994201,994561
9,'Kay .,Marketing,316,994761,995121
9,"So , see you in half an hour .",Project Manager,317,995321,997121
9,Do we go back to our room ?,Marketing,318,997321,998941
9,Yep ?,Marketing,318,999141,999441
9,"Mm , yeah .",User Interface,319,999641,1000301
9,"I think so , yeah .",Project Manager,320,1000501,1001641
10,{vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .,Project Manager,1,1,5101
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,2,5301,6021
10,"So ,",Project Manager,3,6221,6461
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,4,6661,7141
10,as the previous meeting I will be the secretary,Project Manager,5,7341,10161
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,6,10361,10841
10,and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision .,Project Manager,7,11041,18841
10,So I will first uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,7,19041,20901
10,"No y you do the minutes first , or ?",Marketing,8,21101,23261
10,What ?,Project Manager,9,23461,23821
10,No ?,Marketing,10,24021,24261
10,"I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .",Project Manager,11,24461,29681
10,Okay .,Marketing,12,29881,30241
10,Yep .,User Interface,13,30441,30741
10,"So , we'll {disfmarker} S",Project Manager,14,30941,32441
10,Yeah .,User Interface,15,32641,33001
10,technical accessoire ?,Project Manager,16,33201,34521
10,No no no .,User Interface,17,34721,35321
10,Interface ?,Project Manager,18,35521,36181
10,Yeah .,User Interface,19,36381,36741
10,This .,Project Manager,20,36941,37301
10,Mm .,User Interface,21,37501,37741
10,So uh first I will present the concept of user interface .,User Interface,21,37941,41421
10,Um there's three concepts in the user interface .,User Interface,21,41621,44561
10,So first one it's a Google controller .,User Interface,21,44761,47101
10,The second is a fancy controller .,User Interface,21,47301,49341
10,The last one is uh intelligent controller .,User Interface,21,49541,52121
10,So there are three concepts in our controller .,User Interface,21,52321,55141
10,"Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller .",User Interface,21,55341,59541
10,"Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .",User Interface,21,59741,64781
10,So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions .,User Interface,21,64981,69121
10,Uh this is a first concept of our controller .,User Interface,21,69321,72081
10,"The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um",User Interface,21,72281,89621
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,22,89821,90061
10,Mm .,Marketing,23,90261,90501
10,A nice one .,Industrial Designer,24,90701,91421
10,attractive .,User Interface,25,91621,92341
10,"Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .",User Interface,25,92541,96261
10,{vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .,Project Manager,26,96461,101321
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,27,101521,102241
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,28,102441,103161
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know",User Interface,29,103361,105761
10,"{vocalsound} It's very big ,",Project Manager,30,105961,107641
10,if you're {disfmarker},User Interface,31,107841,109161
10,{vocalsound} yeah .,Project Manager,32,109361,110501
10,Yeah .,User Interface,33,110701,111061
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,34,111261,111981
10,It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it .,User Interface,35,112181,115061
10,"{vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,",User Interface,35,115261,117241
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,36,117441,118161
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,37,118361,120281
10,yeah .,User Interface,38,120481,120841
10,"Yeah , why not .",Project Manager,39,121041,122001
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,39,122201,122921
10,Yeah .,User Interface,40,123121,123481
10,Yeah .,User Interface,40,123681,124041
10,"We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,",Project Manager,41,124241,127121
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,42,127321,128461
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,42,128661,129801
10,so .,Project Manager,43,130001,130241
10,Yeah .,User Interface,44,130441,130801
10,Mm .,Marketing,45,131001,131241
10,So the last uh concept is intelligent .,User Interface,46,131441,133781
10,"We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,",User Interface,46,133981,136801
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,47,137001,137481
10,Mm .,Marketing,48,137681,137921
10,"so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition .",User Interface,49,138121,152521
10,Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .,User Interface,49,152721,157821
10,Okay .,Project Manager,50,158021,158381
10,Something else ?,Project Manager,50,158581,159541
10,Okay .,User Interface,51,159741,160101
10,No .,User Interface,51,160301,160541
10,There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .,User Interface,51,160741,164641
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,52,164841,165201
10,"I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,",Project Manager,53,165401,174761
10,Yeah .,User Interface,54,174961,175321
10,Yeah .,User Interface,54,175521,175881
10,"but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels .",Project Manager,55,176081,182981
10,Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?,Project Manager,55,183181,186061
10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,56,186261,187581
10,"Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?",Project Manager,57,187781,196421
10,Y,User Interface,58,196621,196681
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,59,196881,197601
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,60,197801,198941
10,Maybe .,Industrial Designer,60,199141,199561
10,"or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while .",Project Manager,61,199761,206361
10,You don't think so ?,Project Manager,61,206561,207761
10,Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .,User Interface,62,207961,214381
10,"Yeah , sure .",Project Manager,63,214581,215361
10,"For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .",User Interface,64,215561,224621
10,I,Project Manager,65,224821,224881
10,"Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so .",Industrial Designer,66,225081,229641
10,That's true .,Project Manager,67,229841,230621
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,67,230821,231541
10,One and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,68,231741,232941
10,"Yeah , but suppose you got a cold .",Project Manager,69,233141,235241
10,You have a mute remote controller .,Project Manager,69,235441,237541
10,Yeah .,User Interface,70,237741,238101
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,71,238301,239021
10,Mm .,Marketing,72,239221,239461
10,So you can use your gesture .,User Interface,73,239661,241401
10,That's no problem .,User Interface,73,241601,242741
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,73,242941,243661
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,74,243861,244581
10,Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?,Marketing,75,244781,251141
10,Broken arm ?,Project Manager,76,251341,252061
10,For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker},User Interface,77,252261,260241
10,Okay .,Marketing,78,260441,260801
10,Okay .,Marketing,78,261001,261361
10,"Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ?",Project Manager,79,261561,270681
10,Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?,Project Manager,79,270881,274121
10,Yeah .,User Interface,80,274321,274681
10,{vocalsound} Yep .,Industrial Designer,81,274881,275961
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,81,276161,276881
10,But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway .,Marketing,82,277081,280861
10,Why ?,Project Manager,83,281061,281361
10,"Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .",User Interface,84,281561,284141
10,If you have one brother and one sister,Project Manager,85,284341,286621
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Marketing,86,286821,287841
10,"and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,",Project Manager,87,288041,291521
10,"Yeah , but the {disfmarker}",Marketing,88,291721,293341
10,"so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,",Project Manager,89,293541,298521
10,{vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah,Industrial Designer,90,298721,301061
10,"Yeah , it's very interesting .",User Interface,91,301261,303061
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,91,303261,303981
10,Yeah but this {disfmarker},Marketing,92,304181,305741
10,so .,Project Manager,93,305941,306181
10,but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control,Industrial Designer,94,306381,310761
10,Yeah .,Marketing,95,310961,311321
10,because the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,96,311521,312961
10,Yeah .,User Interface,97,313161,313521
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,98,313721,314081
10,I don't think it {disfmarker},Marketing,99,314281,316021
10,"but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .",Project Manager,100,316221,320481
10,{vocalsound} That's right .,Industrial Designer,101,320681,322301
10,You're not you're not obliged to share it .,Project Manager,102,322501,325081
10,"Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .",Marketing,103,325281,329721
10,"Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,104,329921,331901
10,"Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller .",User Interface,105,332101,335821
10,"Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,",User Interface,105,336021,340881
10,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,106,341081,344321
10,No .,Marketing,107,344521,344761
10,"so it's c come to channel three ,",User Interface,108,344961,346941
10,"No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .",Marketing,109,347141,349601
10,I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface,110,349801,352261
10,"Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .",Project Manager,111,352461,354621
10,It's advantage .,User Interface,112,354821,355781
10,Yeah .,Marketing,113,355981,356341
10,And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to,Industrial Designer,114,356541,361761
10,"Yeah , but one other question .",Project Manager,115,361961,363821
10,"manual controllers , eh .",Industrial Designer,116,364021,365521
10,How how much will it cost ?,Project Manager,117,365721,367341
10,"No , more expensive maybe .",Industrial Designer,118,367541,369161
10,How much ?,User Interface,119,369361,369961
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,120,370161,370521
10,Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .,Project Manager,120,370721,374801
10,No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker},User Interface,121,375001,377881
10,Some some efficient .,Project Manager,122,378081,379341
10,Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker},Marketing,123,379541,382301
10,"No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .",User Interface,124,382501,390001
10,So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ?,Project Manager,125,390201,393861
10,Or ?,Project Manager,125,394061,394301
10,"Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}",User Interface,126,394501,403501
10,"Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,127,403701,405441
10,it's uh {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,128,405641,407261
10,It's {disfmarker},User Interface,128,407461,408481
10,But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built .,Marketing,129,408681,412581
10,"Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .",Marketing,129,412781,419321
10,"Well y y you have also the language problem ,",Industrial Designer,130,419521,422221
10,No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface,131,422421,428301
10,you know when you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,132,428501,430301
10,Mm-mm .,Project Manager,133,430501,430921
10,"'Cause it it have to be universal ,",Industrial Designer,134,431121,433221
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,135,433421,433781
10,I agree with uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,135,433981,435661
10,so .,Industrial Designer,136,435861,436101
10,"The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .",User Interface,137,436301,439661
10,Yeah .,Marketing,138,439861,440221
10,"Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international",Project Manager,139,440421,445101
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,140,445301,446441
10,Yeah .,User Interface,141,446641,447001
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,142,447201,447921
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,143,448121,448841
10,remote control .,Project Manager,144,449041,450001
10,We need something that is international .,Project Manager,144,450201,452661
10,Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .,Project Manager,144,452861,456281
10,Yeah .,User Interface,145,456481,456841
10,The recognition system will be able to understand French .,Project Manager,146,457041,460521
10,"If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,",Project Manager,146,460721,464921
10,Yeah .,User Interface,147,465121,465481
10,so .,Project Manager,148,465681,465921
10,"Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation",User Interface,149,466121,474101
10,"Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}",Marketing,150,474301,478261
10,Yeah but you know .,Industrial Designer,151,478461,479601
10,The product {disfmarker} The pro,Industrial Designer,151,479801,481721
10,mechanism .,User Interface,152,481921,482581
10,It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese .,User Interface,152,482781,488481
10,It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .,User Interface,152,488681,492881
10,"{vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,153,493081,497881
10,"Mm , okay .",Project Manager,154,498081,498741
10,Yeah .,Marketing,155,498941,499301
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",User Interface,156,499501,500641
10,And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?,Project Manager,157,500841,505161
10,it's {disfmarker},User Interface,158,505361,506381
10,Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer,159,506581,508021
10,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,159,508221,509181
10,Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .,User Interface,160,509381,513641
10,"Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}",Project Manager,161,513841,516001
10,So {disfmarker},User Interface,162,516201,517101
10,"Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .",Industrial Designer,163,517301,527021
10,Yeah .,User Interface,164,527221,527581
10,Yeah .,User Interface,164,527781,528141
10,"If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .",Industrial Designer,165,528341,532241
10,Mm .,Marketing,166,532441,532681
10,"Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .",User Interface,167,532881,536901
10,"Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,",Industrial Designer,168,537101,539981
10,Yeah .,User Interface,169,540181,540541
10,because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,170,540741,543501
10,Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker},User Interface,171,543701,550661
10,Oh really ?,Industrial Designer,172,550861,551521
10,{vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,172,551721,554421
10,Oh .,Project Manager,173,554621,554861
10,"Yeah ,",Marketing,174,555061,555421
10,Seems to be quite complex .,Project Manager,175,555621,557241
10,"but then w Yeah ,",Marketing,176,557441,558461
10,Comple,Industrial Designer,177,558661,559021
10,"No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} .",User Interface,178,559221,561561
10,we have to take care of the twelve Euros,Marketing,179,561761,564161
10,"And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?",Project Manager,180,564361,567901
10,problem .,Marketing,181,568101,568641
10,And where will be they ?,Project Manager,182,568841,570281
10,Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?,Project Manager,182,570481,573841
10,No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone .,User Interface,183,574041,581121
10,It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller .,User Interface,183,581321,585521
10,"Yeah , but where is the controller ?",Project Manager,184,585721,587881
10,Okay .,Marketing,185,588081,588441
10,Where is the controller ?,User Interface,186,588641,590141
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,187,590341,590701
10,"It's in your family , in your home .",User Interface,188,590901,593061

10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,189,594181,594901
10,"Yeah , but we're {disfmarker}",Project Manager,190,595101,596841
10,"No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,191,597041,599981
10,here it's uh an object .,Project Manager,192,600181,601621
10,But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .,Project Manager,192,601821,604941
10,Yeah .,User Interface,193,605141,605501
10,Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .,User Interface,193,605701,608701
10,A microphone maybe .,Industrial Designer,194,608901,610101
10,"Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .",Project Manager,195,610301,618101
10,"If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .",Project Manager,195,618301,622981
10,To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .,Industrial Designer,196,623181,625221
10,You just want to interact with television .,Project Manager,197,625421,628001
10,"Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you",User Interface,198,628201,632461
10,"I if you say one , he switch to channel ,",Industrial Designer,199,632661,635121
10,you use your command,User Interface,200,635321,636521
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,201,636721,637861
10,yeah .,Industrial Designer,202,638061,638421
10,and you do s your gesture .,User Interface,203,638621,640241
10,but you can lose it .,Project Manager,204,640441,641701
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,204,641901,642621
10,No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker},User Interface,205,642821,646901
10,So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .,Industrial Designer,206,647101,659461
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,207,659661,660381
10,Yeah .,User Interface,208,660581,660941
10,Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box,Project Manager,209,661141,664621
10,Devic,Industrial Designer,210,664821,665121
10,and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .,Project Manager,211,665321,668981
10,Yeah .,Marketing,212,669181,669541
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,213,669741,670101
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,213,670301,670661
10,Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control .,Industrial Designer,213,670861,676681
10,Ah .,Project Manager,214,676881,677121
10,Yeah .,User Interface,215,677321,677681
10,But you would still have the buttons .,Marketing,216,677881,680161
10,Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ?,Marketing,216,680361,686121
10,Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?,Marketing,216,686321,689561
10,think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker},User Interface,217,689761,695341
10,"Okay , so you {disfmarker}",Marketing,218,695541,697101
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,219,697301,697661
10,yeah .,User Interface,220,697861,698221
10,yeah .,Marketing,221,698421,698781
10,You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another .,User Interface,222,698981,703241
10,Mm .,Project Manager,223,703441,703681
10,"Yeah , I dunno .",Marketing,224,703881,704841
10,It's a bit risky risky .,Marketing,224,705041,706481
10,I think so .,Project Manager,225,706681,707401
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,226,707601,707961
10,"No ,",User Interface,227,708161,708401
10,And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker},Project Manager,228,708601,710941
10,that's quite inter quite attractive .,User Interface,229,711141,713361
10,"But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y",Industrial Designer,230,713561,720701
10,"Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .",User Interface,231,720901,724921

10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Marketing,232,726041,727181
10,Yeah but i i {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,233,727381,728881
10,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,234,729081,730221
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,234,730421,731141
10,I dunno .,Marketing,235,731341,731881
10,We should have confidence in technology .,User Interface,236,732081,734541
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,236,734741,735461
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , we should .",Industrial Designer,237,735661,737521
10,{vocalsound} Uh .,Industrial Designer,237,737721,738741
10,Hmm .,Project Manager,238,738941,739241
10,"So , what do you think ?",Project Manager,238,739441,740881
10,We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .,Project Manager,238,741081,743481
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,239,743681,743921
10,What ?,Marketing,240,744121,744481
10,"Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?",Project Manager,241,744681,749541
10,"If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .",Marketing,242,749741,756101
10,"More features , yeah .",User Interface,243,756301,757621
10,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,244,757821,759201
10,But if if if it like doubles uh,Marketing,245,759401,761261
10,"I think he need a control that is very reliable ,",Industrial Designer,246,761461,764401
10,no one would would be interested .,Marketing,247,764601,766641
10,so .,Industrial Designer,248,766841,767081
10,So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .,Project Manager,249,767281,775021
10,Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ?,Project Manager,249,775221,779121
10,Hmm ?,Project Manager,249,779321,779621
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,250,779821,780961
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,250,781161,781521
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,251,781721,782441
10,"Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .",Project Manager,252,782641,790921
10,You think it's possible ?,Project Manager,252,791121,792621
10,Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts .,User Interface,253,792821,797261
10,So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?,User Interface,253,797461,802441
10,"There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?",User Interface,253,802641,810861
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,254,811061,812201
10,Yeah .,Marketing,255,812401,812761
10,"No ,",Marketing,255,812961,813201
10,Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker},User Interface,256,813401,822221
10,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing,257,822421,823561
10,It's not really the {disfmarker} we,Industrial Designer,258,823761,825861
10,Y,Marketing,259,826061,826121
10,"we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that .",Industrial Designer,260,826321,832861
10,But uh I think a user need {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,260,833061,835401
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ .",User Interface,261,835601,842201
10,"You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,",User Interface,261,842401,846901
10,"No ,",Marketing,262,847101,847341
10,but {disfmarker},User Interface,263,847541,848501
10,but you need you need new remote controller then .,Marketing,264,848701,851701
10,"Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,",Marketing,264,851901,857061
10,Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah,Industrial Designer,265,857261,860321
10,Okay .,User Interface,266,860521,860881
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing,267,861081,861981
10,if we can send email from it .,Industrial Designer,268,862181,863981
10,"But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .",User Interface,269,864181,871921
10,No .,Marketing,270,872121,872361
10,No .,Marketing,270,872561,872801
10,Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,271,873001,881401
10,Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing,272,881601,883821
10,"Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,",User Interface,273,884021,890621
10,Yeah .,Marketing,274,890821,891181
10,"Yeah , but uh we want so",Project Manager,275,891381,892821
10,"but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .",User Interface,276,893021,906521
10,"Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker}",Marketing,277,906721,908941
10,That's {disfmarker},User Interface,278,909141,910281
10,True .,Marketing,279,910481,910841
10,"the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products .",User Interface,280,911041,919381
10,"Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .",Project Manager,281,919581,925701
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,282,925901,926921
10,Yeah .,User Interface,283,927121,927481

10,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,285,931301,932621
10,You don't need to tune it .,Project Manager,286,932821,934441
10,"so , yeah .",Industrial Designer,287,934641,935301
10,"Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?",User Interface,288,935501,944201
10,"Yeah , why not ?",Project Manager,289,944401,945361
10,If it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,289,945561,946761
10,"I mean , for example the goo y",Marketing,290,946961,948761
10,Because you have new {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,291,948961,950941
10,you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .,Marketing,292,951141,954741
10,Yeah .,User Interface,293,954941,955301
10,Yeah .,User Interface,293,955501,955861
10,I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google .,Marketing,294,956061,962421
10,"Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine ,",Marketing,294,962621,965441
10,Yeah .,User Interface,295,965641,966001
10,"so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .",Marketing,296,966201,972741
10,Yeah .,User Interface,297,972941,973301
10,"Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .",User Interface,297,973501,978001
10,"Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition",Marketing,298,978201,984501
10,The {disfmarker} then nn,User Interface,299,984701,986141
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing,300,986341,987241
10,no .,User Interface,301,987441,987681
10,"if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .",Marketing,302,987881,995261
10,Tha,User Interface,303,995461,995641
10,Not too expensive too .,Project Manager,304,995841,997221
10,But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .,User Interface,305,997421,1007201
10,See {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Marketing,306,1007401,1009141
10,That's the same {disfmarker},User Interface,307,1009341,1011021

10,yeah .,User Interface,309,1012621,1012981
10,yeah .,Marketing,310,1013181,1013541
10,"I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .",Marketing,310,1013741,1020281
10,{vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,311,1020481,1022161

10,Okay .,Project Manager,378,1144941,1145301
10,I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,379,1145501,1149581
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,380,1149781,1150501
10,"Okay , never mind .",Project Manager,381,1150701,1151841
10,so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r,Industrial Designer,382,1152041,1160981
10,Okay .,User Interface,383,1161181,1161541
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,384,1161741,1162461
10,of the remote control .,Industrial Designer,385,1162661,1164041
10,So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside,Industrial Designer,385,1164241,1169101
10,Okay .,User Interface,386,1169301,1169661
10,Okay .,User Interface,386,1169861,1170221
10,and {disfmarker} so .,Industrial Designer,387,1170421,1171681
10,"So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,",Industrial Designer,387,1171881,1179321
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,388,1179521,1180001
10,so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one .,Industrial Designer,389,1180201,1187161
10,"So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,",Industrial Designer,389,1187361,1192341
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,390,1192541,1193021
10,"so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,",Industrial Designer,391,1193221,1203961
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,392,1204161,1204641
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,393,1204841,1205321
10,"or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .",Industrial Designer,394,1205521,1208521
10,Okay .,Project Manager,395,1208721,1209081
10,Okay .,User Interface,396,1209281,1209641
10,"And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation",Industrial Designer,397,1209841,1220521
10,Uh-huh .,User Interface,398,1220721,1221201
10,or will it be a battery like the classical battery so .,Industrial Designer,399,1221401,1224701
10,"And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come",Industrial Designer,399,1224901,1251181
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,400,1251381,1251861
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,400,1252061,1252541
10,"and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .",Industrial Designer,401,1252741,1261981
10,"Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control",Project Manager,402,1262181,1265541
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,403,1265741,1266101
10,"Yeah , yeah mm .",Industrial Designer,403,1266301,1267261
10,and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers,Project Manager,404,1267461,1271061
10,"Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,405,1271261,1274081
10,Yeah .,Marketing,406,1274281,1274641
10,Yeah .,Marketing,406,1274841,1275201
10,"and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,",Project Manager,407,1275401,1283621
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,408,1283821,1284541
10,no ?,Project Manager,409,1284741,1284981
10,"Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,",Industrial Designer,410,1285181,1297961
10,So .,Project Manager,411,1298161,1298401
10,"but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,",Industrial Designer,412,1298601,1302261
10,Yeah .,Marketing,413,1302461,1302821
10,Okay .,Project Manager,414,1303021,1303381
10,so hmm .,Industrial Designer,415,1303581,1304061
10,And what tha what about the uh materials ?,Project Manager,416,1304261,1306781
10,"And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common",Industrial Designer,417,1306981,1316161
10,"Impersonal , mm-hmm .",Project Manager,418,1316361,1317621
10,"it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,",Industrial Designer,419,1317821,1324721
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,420,1324921,1325281
10,Special for {disfmarker},Marketing,421,1325481,1326921
10,"or you know , you can have some {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,422,1327121,1329761
10,"Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .",Project Manager,423,1329961,1336861
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,424,1337061,1337541
10,"Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood",Industrial Designer,425,1337741,1343921
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,426,1344121,1344601
10,Yeah .,Marketing,427,1344801,1345161

10,Mm .,Project Manager,428,1346041,1346281
10,and it can be interesting .,Industrial Designer,429,1346481,1348101
10,"Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .",Project Manager,430,1348301,1350701
10,"And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .",Industrial Designer,431,1350901,1365721
10,"Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .",Project Manager,432,1365921,1372941
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,433,1373141,1373501
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,433,1373701,1374061

10,And you think that we will be {disfmarker},Project Manager,434,1375241,1377761
10,"Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,",Industrial Designer,435,1377961,1382101
10,Okay .,Project Manager,436,1382301,1382661
10,so .,Industrial Designer,437,1382861,1383101
10,So wood .,Project Manager,438,1383301,1383841
10,{gap},Industrial Designer,439,1384041,1384341
10,And what about the buttons ?,Project Manager,440,1384541,1386221
10,"I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion",Industrial Designer,441,1386421,1398241
10,"No it's fashion , yeah .",Project Manager,442,1398441,1399881
10,"and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .",Industrial Designer,443,1400081,1413041
10,What about the touch scr touch screen ?,Marketing,444,1413241,1415581
10,For example .,Marketing,444,1415781,1416561
10,It's it's expensive I I guess .,Marketing,444,1416761,1418621
10,{vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .,Industrial Designer,445,1418821,1424701
10,Mm .,Marketing,446,1424901,1425141
10,"But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean .",Industrial Designer,447,1425341,1428941
10,It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,447,1429141,1432741
10,Yeah .,Marketing,448,1432941,1433301
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,449,1433501,1434221
10,So you got email ?,User Interface,450,1434421,1435501
10,I dunno .,Project Manager,451,1435701,1436241
10,{vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .,Project Manager,451,1436441,1441361
10,Okay .,Marketing,452,1441561,1441921
10,Participant four ?,Project Manager,453,1442121,1443201
10,Functional requirements ?,Project Manager,453,1443401,1444901
10,"Uh no , trend watching .",Marketing,454,1445101,1446541

10,{vocalsound},Marketing,454,1448621,1449341
10,This one ?,Project Manager,455,1449541,1450141
10,Yeah .,Marketing,456,1450341,1450701
10,"Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .",Marketing,456,1450901,1468241
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,457,1468441,1469161
10,"So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting .",Marketing,458,1469361,1474101
10,Um user really really want a fancy look and feel .,Marketing,458,1474301,1477301
10,"They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay .",Marketing,458,1477501,1481581
10,"Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically",Marketing,458,1481781,1489221
10,Mm .,User Interface,459,1489421,1489661
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,460,1489861,1490101
10,"but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .",Marketing,461,1490301,1503501
10,Okay .,Project Manager,462,1503701,1504061
10,"At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .",Marketing,463,1504261,1507681
10,So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .,Marketing,463,1507881,1512261
10,{gap},Industrial Designer,464,1512461,1512761
10,Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay .,Marketing,465,1512961,1516621
10,"Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,",Marketing,465,1516821,1524741
10,Ah yes .,Industrial Designer,466,1524941,1525421
10,"okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .",Marketing,467,1525621,1531141
10,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,468,1531341,1532121
10,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,468,1532321,1533101
10,'Cause it's it's really what people want .,Marketing,469,1533301,1535821
10,"Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .",Marketing,469,1536021,1540461
10,"And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .",Marketing,469,1540661,1549661
10,"Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three .",Marketing,469,1549861,1554241
10,Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .,Marketing,469,1554441,1559661
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,470,1559861,1560221
10,"So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris",Marketing,471,1560421,1568461
10,And fruit and vegetables yeah .,Industrial Designer,472,1568661,1570521
10,we go to the fruits and vede vegetables .,Marketing,473,1570721,1573181
10,"And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,",Marketing,473,1573381,1578241
10,{vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .,Industrial Designer,474,1578441,1580781
10,okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .,Marketing,475,1580981,1585181
10,"Okay , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,476,1585381,1586581
10,I dunno .,Marketing,477,1586781,1587321
10,"Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?",Industrial Designer,478,1587521,1592201
10,Yeah thi this is this would be like um,Marketing,479,1592401,1594681

10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,486,1610561,1610921
10,"So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .",Project Manager,487,1611121,1615801
10,"So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,",Project Manager,487,1616001,1625841

10,"It depends on the design we want ,",Industrial Designer,510,1672381,1674421
10,"Yeah , maybe the base .",Marketing,511,1674621,1676001
10,so .,Industrial Designer,512,1676201,1676441
10,It's it's natural .,Project Manager,513,1676641,1677781
10,But still y,Marketing,514,1677981,1678641

10,Yeah .,Marketing,517,1682001,1682361
10,and i,Industrial Designer,518,1682561,1682861
10,so maybe we can stay with wood .,Project Manager,519,1683061,1684981
10,"And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol",Industrial Designer,520,1685181,1692021
10,"Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .",Marketing,521,1692221,1696241
10,"Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .",Industrial Designer,522,1696441,1698421
10,But it's still fashion .,Project Manager,523,1698621,1700061
10,"But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,",Marketing,524,1700261,1705061
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,525,1705261,1705621

10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,527,1706141,1706501
10,I dunno .,Marketing,528,1706701,1707241
10,something that you can {vocalsound} into it .,Project Manager,529,1707441,1710141
10,Yeah .,Marketing,530,1710341,1710701
10,Uh and what about the user interface concept ?,Project Manager,531,1710901,1713661
10,{vocalsound} Google and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,532,1713861,1716021
10,Google and fancy ?,Project Manager,533,1716221,1717301
10,"and fancy , f how about the the voice ?",Industrial Designer,534,1717501,1719841
10,{vocalsound} And {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,534,1720041,1721781
10,Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .,Project Manager,535,1721981,1728341
10,Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested,Industrial Designer,536,1728541,1733161
10,Uh yes .,User Interface,537,1733361,1733841
10,and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control .,Industrial Designer,538,1734041,1740941
10,Yeah .,Marketing,539,1741141,1741501

10,{vocalsound},User Interface,542,1745341,1746061
10,"But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,",Industrial Designer,543,1746261,1758621
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,544,1758821,1759961
10,so .,Industrial Designer,545,1760161,1760401
10,but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .,Project Manager,546,1760601,1764501
10,"But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .",Industrial Designer,547,1764701,1769021
10,That's true .,Project Manager,548,1769221,1770001
10,Yeah {disfmarker} d,Marketing,549,1770201,1771341
10,Okay .,User Interface,550,1771541,1771901

10,I dunno .,Marketing,552,1776981,1777521
10,Mm .,User Interface,553,1777721,1777961
10,"maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .",Project Manager,554,1778161,1787701
10,Yeah .,User Interface,555,1787901,1788261

10,"Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value .",Project Manager,561,1805581,1809241
10,I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,562,1809441,1812681
10,"It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,562,1812881,1818341
10,With a module ?,Project Manager,563,1818541,1819441

11,"Okay , um .",Marketing,39,119361,120021
11,"In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out .",Marketing,39,120221,133661
11,"Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about .",Marketing,39,133861,138121
11,"Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons .",Marketing,39,138321,161481
11,"Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ .",Marketing,39,161681,163301
11,I don't know what R_S_I_ means .,Marketing,39,163501,165421

11,Hm .,Project Manager,40,170501,170741
11,"Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .",Marketing,41,170941,180361
11,So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .,Marketing,41,180561,184761
11,They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour .,Marketing,41,184961,188261
11,"And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order .",Marketing,41,188461,193441
11,"Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .",Marketing,41,193641,196701
11,"The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .",Marketing,41,196901,217541
11,"Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .",Marketing,41,217741,224701
11,"And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing .",Marketing,41,224901,252201
11,"Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .",Marketing,41,252401,266441
11,"{vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .",Marketing,41,266641,271321

11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,55,319621,320341
11,And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .,User Interface,56,320541,329481
11,"Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ .",User Interface,56,329681,365261
11,Does it have like capacity to change the channels ?,User Interface,56,365461,368521
11,Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ?,User Interface,56,368721,374601
11,"And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ?",User Interface,56,374801,378401
11,"And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .",User Interface,56,378601,392341
11,"{vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .",User Interface,56,392541,408621
11,{vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .,User Interface,56,408821,411521
11,{gap},Project Manager,57,411721,412021
11,Okay .,User Interface,58,412221,412581
11,You need the little thingy .,User Interface,58,412781,414461
11,Ooh .,User Interface,58,414661,414961
11,How do I um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,59,415161,416601
11,S That's on view .,Marketing,60,416801,417881
11,Right .,Industrial Designer,61,418081,418501
11,Oh .,Marketing,62,418701,418941
11,"Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting .",Industrial Designer,63,419141,431921
11,"Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,63,432121,442141
11,And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .,Industrial Designer,63,442341,456081
11,"So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration .",Industrial Designer,63,456281,479141
11,"And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall .",Industrial Designer,63,479341,491281
11,And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works .,Industrial Designer,63,491481,495201
11,"Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,63,495401,504941
11,"And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead .",Industrial Designer,63,505141,515821
11,"That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .",Industrial Designer,63,516021,524061
11,"Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver .",Industrial Designer,63,524261,547121
11,Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .,Industrial Designer,63,547321,556441
11,So that concludes my presentation .,Industrial Designer,63,556641,558741
11,'Kay .,Project Manager,64,558941,559301
11,Do you know about like {disfmarker},User Interface,65,559501,561601
11,Mm ?,Industrial Designer,66,561801,562041
11,"I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,67,562241,566081
11,"Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .",Industrial Designer,68,566281,569401
11,Okay .,User Interface,69,569601,569961
11,Cool .,User Interface,69,570161,570521
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,69,570721,571441
11,Okay .,Project Manager,70,571641,572001
11,Well thank you everybody .,Project Manager,70,572201,573761
11,Um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in .,Project Manager,70,573961,581761
11,"Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list .",Project Manager,70,581961,589221
11,"Um ,",Project Manager,70,589421,589661
11,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,71,589861,591361
11,"also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television .",Project Manager,72,591561,599541
11,"Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess .",Project Manager,72,599741,608981
11,"Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that .",Project Manager,72,609181,620581
11,Okay .,Project Manager,72,620781,621141
11,Um .,Project Manager,72,621341,621581
11,So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions .,Project Manager,72,621781,625801
11,"Um , yeah .",Project Manager,72,626001,626661
11,{vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker},Project Manager,72,626861,629681
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,73,629881,630601
11,"I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker}",Project Manager,74,630801,635901
11,Like in terms of,User Interface,75,636101,637061
11,How it looks or {disfmarker},Marketing,76,637261,638941
11,"how it looks , or like what it does ?",User Interface,77,639141,641361
11,wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s,Project Manager,78,641561,650261
11,Okay .,User Interface,79,650461,650821
11,the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing .,Project Manager,80,651021,654201
11,So .,Project Manager,80,654401,654641
11,Yeah .,User Interface,81,654841,655201
11,Okay .,User Interface,81,655401,655761
11,So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?,User Interface,81,655961,663821
11,{vocalsound} I think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,82,664021,667261
11,Mm .,Project Manager,82,667461,667701
11,So {disfmarker},User Interface,83,667901,668801
11,It's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer,84,669001,670441
11,Okay .,User Interface,85,670641,671001
11,So the {disfmarker},User Interface,85,671201,672341
11,"{gap} the the buzzer you mean ,",Marketing,86,672541,674401
11,"yeah , yeah , yeah .",User Interface,87,674601,675801
11,Locator .,Industrial Designer,88,676001,676541
11,"yeah , for sure , yeah .",Marketing,89,676741,678181
11,"So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,",User Interface,90,678381,682761
11,"Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .",Project Manager,91,682961,685481
11,what was it ?,User Interface,92,685681,686461
11,Well that's for speech recognition .,Marketing,93,686661,688821
11,"Oh , uh .",Project Manager,94,689021,689561
11,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,95,689761,690781
11,Oh .,User Interface,96,690981,691221
11,And screen .,Marketing,97,691421,692141
11,That's only for speech recognition and screen .,Marketing,97,692341,695161
11,"I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,",Industrial Designer,98,695361,700641
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,99,700841,701201
11,"and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,",Industrial Designer,100,701401,711721
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,101,711921,712881
11,Mm .,Project Manager,102,713081,713321
11,"or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly ,",Industrial Designer,103,713521,715861
11,Yeah .,User Interface,104,716061,716421
11,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing,105,716621,717761
11,I'm not sure how you would implement it .,Industrial Designer,106,717961,720421
11,Yeah .,User Interface,107,720621,720981
11,I just put the values {vocalsound} in .,Marketing,108,721181,723521
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,109,723721,724441
11,"And if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker}",Project Manager,110,724641,728241
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,111,728441,729161
11,"But um the screen is the same as what , {gap}",Marketing,112,729361,732061
11,It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,113,732261,735021
11,"if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .",Project Manager,114,735221,742301
11,Yeah .,User Interface,115,742501,742861
11,"Yeah , I'm happy with that .",Marketing,116,743061,744741
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,117,744941,746081
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,118,746281,747001
11,Right so um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,119,747201,749061
11,Hu yeah .,User Interface,120,749261,749801
11,{vocalsound} Completely .,Marketing,121,750001,751501
11,Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .,User Interface,122,751701,759021
11,Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .,Industrial Designer,123,759221,766241
11,Yeah .,Marketing,124,766441,766801
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,125,767001,767361
11,Yeah .,User Interface,126,767561,767921
11,"Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .",Industrial Designer,127,768121,782941
11,Okay .,User Interface,128,783141,783501
11,Okay .,User Interface,128,783701,784061
11,Yeah .,Marketing,129,784261,784621
11,Okay .,Project Manager,130,784821,785181
11,Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .,Industrial Designer,131,785381,790541
11,Alright .,User Interface,132,790741,791281
11,Okay .,Marketing,133,791481,791841
11,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface,134,792041,793181
11,So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker},Project Manager,135,793381,798541
11,It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,136,798741,808821
11,right .,Project Manager,137,809021,809441
11,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,137,809641,810421
11,"So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?",Marketing,138,810621,815121
11,"Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .",Industrial Designer,139,815321,821441
11,Okay .,Marketing,140,821641,822001
11,Okay .,Marketing,140,822201,822561
11,So it's now like a two-part thing .,User Interface,141,822761,824861
11,"Yeah , so it would be a two part package .",Industrial Designer,142,825061,827581
11,Okay .,User Interface,143,827781,828141
11,Alright .,User Interface,143,828341,828881
11,Okay .,Marketing,144,829081,829441
11,So we get to design that too .,User Interface,145,829641,831441
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,146,831641,832361
11,{vocalsound} Make it fashionable .,User Interface,147,832561,834601
11,"Um , okay .",User Interface,147,834801,835461
11,So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .,Project Manager,148,835661,844361
11,Yeah I think so .,Industrial Designer,149,844561,845581
11,Yeah .,Marketing,150,845781,846141
11,Just there .,Marketing,150,846341,847061
11,Huh .,Project Manager,151,847261,847561
11,Okay .,Project Manager,151,847761,848121
11,Mm .,Marketing,152,848321,848561
11,Are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it .,Marketing,152,848761,855961
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,153,856161,856521
11,Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?,Marketing,154,856721,863741
11,We probably leave that .,Project Manager,155,863941,865381
11,"I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,155,865581,872181
11,Okay .,Marketing,156,872381,872741
11,Yeah .,User Interface,157,872941,873301
11,Then it can live anywhere .,User Interface,157,873501,875121
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,158,875321,876461
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,159,876661,877381
11,Yeah .,User Interface,160,877581,877941
11,Okay .,Marketing,161,878141,878501
11,"For the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?",Marketing,161,878701,887281
11,Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ?,Industrial Designer,162,887481,889401
11,Are we just having a radio ?,Marketing,163,889601,891281
11,On the phone .,Marketing,163,891481,892321
11,"Um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,",Industrial Designer,164,892521,896961
11,T,User Interface,165,897161,897221
11,You don't need a light .,Marketing,166,897421,898861
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,166,899061,900021
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,167,900221,900581

11,Yeah yeah .,Marketing,169,903081,903741
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,170,903941,904301
11,"I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .",Industrial Designer,171,904501,915361
11,"And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so",Project Manager,172,915561,920421
11,You can hear it's under the couch yeah .,Marketing,173,920621,923021
11,{disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,174,923221,924361
11,So i Yeah .,User Interface,175,924561,925221
11,"Um , {vocalsound} {gap} So need the other buttons .",Marketing,176,925421,928481
11,So we have this {disfmarker} mm .,Marketing,176,928681,930661
11,"So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um ,",Project Manager,177,930861,937821
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,178,938021,938741

11,I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes .,User Interface,182,949341,954861
11,Oh really .,Project Manager,183,955061,955721
11,"'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .",Project Manager,183,955921,961801
11,And uh,User Interface,184,962001,962361
11,Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ?,Industrial Designer,185,962561,967121
11,Yeah .,User Interface,186,967321,967681
11,They're not {disfmarker} no .,Project Manager,187,967881,969621
11,"They're not , no .",Marketing,188,969821,970901
11,"Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .",Industrial Designer,189,971101,976141

11,"Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,",User Interface,199,1000341,1009821
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,200,1010021,1010381

11,So you'd have to have like {disfmarker},User Interface,358,1569881,1572221
11,Yeah .,Marketing,359,1572421,1572781
11,"I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like .",User Interface,360,1572981,1585161
11,So {disfmarker},User Interface,360,1585361,1586261
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,361,1586461,1586821
11,Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .,Industrial Designer,362,1587021,1589601
11,"Yeah ,",User Interface,363,1589801,1590161
11,"Yeah , it is only fun",Marketing,364,1590361,1591621
11,"but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .",User Interface,365,1591821,1598301
11,But i Yeah .,Project Manager,366,1598501,1599221
11,Oh .,Industrial Designer,367,1599421,1599661
11,But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,367,1599861,1607241
11,Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker},User Interface,368,1607441,1610381
11,but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .,Industrial Designer,369,1610581,1615921
11,"So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that ,",User Interface,370,1616121,1640721
11,"Um , yeah , let's think about it",Project Manager,371,1640921,1642841
11,that like {disfmarker},User Interface,372,1643041,1644361
11,Yes we can try that .,Industrial Designer,373,1644561,1645821
11,'cause we need to wrap up .,Project Manager,374,1646021,1647641

12,"Yeah , I received an email as well .",User Interface,21,34521,36681
12,So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .,Project Manager,22,36881,39941
12,{vocalsound} Oh .,Marketing,23,40141,41161
12,{gap},Project Manager,24,41361,41661

12,Which one was mine ?,User Interface,26,42361,43561
12,So that's me .,Project Manager,27,43761,44601
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,28,44801,45521
12,Uh okay .,Project Manager,29,45721,46261
12,So {disfmarker} Uh okay .,Project Manager,29,46461,47961
12,"Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .",Project Manager,29,48161,53381

12,Whatever .,Project Manager,29,55821,56421
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,30,56621,57341
12,The minutes .,User Interface,31,57541,58321
12,"Okay , so we just talked about uh {disfmarker} Oh you want me to show that there or {disfmarker}",Project Manager,32,58521,64281
12,"No ,",User Interface,33,64481,64721
12,Mm no .,Industrial Designer,34,64921,65341
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,35,65541,66441
12,"Okay ,",Project Manager,36,66641,67001
12,just tell us .,User Interface,37,67201,68041
12,we just talked about it looks .,Project Manager,38,68241,70101
12,Has to look nice .,Project Manager,38,70301,71381
12,Usability is very important .,Project Manager,38,71581,73321
12,People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones .,Project Manager,38,73521,78201
12,"Um {disfmarker} It has to be very basic , not too many buttons .",Project Manager,38,78401,82241
12,Light switches on if you use a button .,Project Manager,38,82441,84781
12,Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility .,Project Manager,38,84981,87621
12,And it has to be easy to learn .,Project Manager,38,87821,89741
12,That were the things I uh make minutes of .,Project Manager,38,89941,92521
12,"And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button .",Project Manager,38,92721,99621
12,That are the functions .,Project Manager,38,99821,101261
12,That right ?,Project Manager,38,101461,102181
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,39,102381,102741
12,Okay .,Project Manager,40,102941,103301
12,Yes .,User Interface,41,103501,103801
12,"So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your {disfmarker}",Project Manager,42,104001,109341
12,Shall I start ?,Marketing,43,109541,110441
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,44,110641,111001
12,{gap} {vocalsound} No .,Marketing,45,111201,112581
12,Okay well {disfmarker} I received an email {disfmarker} Okay .,Marketing,45,112781,116501
12,"I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .",Marketing,45,116701,123721
12,"It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it .",Marketing,45,123921,129081
12,"Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .",Marketing,45,129281,138761
12,So it's very important for us to create something new .,Marketing,45,138961,142261
12,"So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .",Marketing,45,142461,148221
12,Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .,Marketing,45,148421,152621
12,Uh this uh aspect is the most important one .,Marketing,45,152821,155521
12,Uh it came out of the research .,Marketing,45,155721,157641
12,It uh is twice important as the following .,Marketing,45,157841,160421
12,{vocalsound} The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .,Marketing,45,160621,167401
12,Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .,Marketing,45,167601,170721
12,"And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .",Marketing,45,170921,179981
12,Hmm .,User Interface,46,180181,180481
12,"But um {vocalsound} this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .",Marketing,47,180681,189141
12,But we already have the flashing flashing light on the {disfmarker},Project Manager,48,189341,193361
12,{vocalsound} Uh maybe maybe something new .,Marketing,49,193561,196141
12,"Yeah , more .",User Interface,50,196341,197121
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,51,197321,197621
12,"We have to discuss about it s uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh {gap}",Marketing,52,197821,201481
12,Okay .,Project Manager,53,201681,202041
12,"Well , I'll I'll get back on it .",User Interface,54,202241,204221
12,features not uh do not exist in current remote controls .,Marketing,55,204421,207841
12,And that's very hard I think .,Marketing,55,208041,209841
12,Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .,Marketing,55,210041,214601
12,But uh that was an overall uh point .,Marketing,55,214801,217021
12,We already discussed that .,Marketing,55,217221,218841
12,Um I've got one picture .,Marketing,55,219041,220541
12,Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .,Marketing,55,220741,224821
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,56,225021,225381
12,So I took uh that part of the webpage .,Marketing,57,225581,227921
12,"And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends .",Marketing,57,228121,235921
12,"This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe .",Marketing,57,236121,240801
12,But it's about uh clothes and shoes .,Marketing,57,241001,243221
12,Hmm .,Project Manager,58,243421,243721
12,"But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .",Marketing,59,243921,251301
12,Spongy .,User Interface,60,251501,251981
12,"But spongy , what what does spongy says ?",Marketing,61,252181,254641
12,Spongy .,Industrial Designer,62,254841,255321
12,"Spongy , like sponge .",User Interface,63,255521,256841
12,Spongy .,Marketing,64,257041,257521
12,Okay .,Marketing,64,257721,258081
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,64,258281,259001
12,"So rubber , kind of .",Industrial Designer,65,259201,260461
12,Uh soft materials .,User Interface,66,260661,261801
12,"But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,",Project Manager,67,262001,264821
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,68,265021,265381
12,because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .,Project Manager,69,265581,270321
12,So it has to be {vocalsound} flexible .,Project Manager,69,270521,272861
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface,70,273061,274861
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,71,275061,275781
12,Yeah .,Marketing,72,275981,276341
12,"Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there .",Marketing,72,276541,279301
12,But I didn't knew uh knew what it means .,Marketing,72,279501,281961
12,So spongy means y Yeah .,Marketing,72,282161,283601
12,It's like a sponge .,Industrial Designer,73,283801,285001
12,"Soft , sponge .",User Interface,74,285201,286101
12,So it's also a stress-ball .,Marketing,75,286301,287981
12,That's a good {disfmarker} That's a good idea .,Project Manager,76,288181,291001
12,If it's de like that .,Project Manager,76,291201,292521
12,"That's good , a good idea .",Project Manager,76,292721,294341
12,"Yeah , somewhat like {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,77,294541,296521
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface,78,296721,298521
12,Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ?,Project Manager,79,298721,302321
12,How are you gonna make it ?,User Interface,80,302521,304141
12,R_ soft .,Project Manager,81,304341,304881
12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,82,305081,305441
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,83,305641,306541
12,"I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .",Industrial Designer,84,306741,311901
12,Okay .,Project Manager,85,312101,312461
12,Okay ?,Marketing,86,312661,313021
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,87,313221,313941
12,What do I think ?,Marketing,88,314141,315161
12,"Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .",Marketing,88,315361,322561
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,89,322761,323121
12,Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front .,Marketing,90,323321,326141
12,Because it's uh it's hot .,Marketing,90,326341,327901
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,91,328101,328821
12,And uh some basic uh colour fronts .,Marketing,92,329021,331181
12,{vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something .,Marketing,92,331381,336421
12,"Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .",Marketing,92,336621,339561
12,"{vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .",Marketing,92,339761,345341
12,Yeah .,User Interface,93,345541,345901
12,"Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno .",Marketing,94,346101,351561
12,We have to discuss about that .,Marketing,94,351761,353621
12,Uh y yeah .,Marketing,94,353821,354481
12,Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative .,Marketing,94,354681,358581
12,"Yeah , how do we do that ?",Marketing,94,358781,360341
12,Maybe speech ?,Marketing,94,360541,361381
12,We ma must have some kind of gadget .,Marketing,94,361581,363801
12,"Yeah , I'll get back on that .",User Interface,95,364001,365801
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,96,366001,366301
12,So {disfmarker},Marketing,97,366501,367401
12,{vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .,Project Manager,98,367601,370721
12,Intro,Marketing,99,370921,371221
12,Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .,Project Manager,100,371421,376521
12,Yeah .,Marketing,101,376721,377081
12,"Well ,",User Interface,102,377281,377641
12,"Yeah , that's the problem .",Marketing,103,377841,379461
12,That's the main problem .,Marketing,103,379661,381161
12,I got f also an email from the the technology department .,User Interface,104,381361,384841
12,So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .,Marketing,105,385041,389361
12,"They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech .",User Interface,106,389561,394721
12,So they recommended using it .,User Interface,106,394921,396721
12,Okay .,Project Manager,107,396921,397281
12,Well {disfmarker},User Interface,108,397481,398501
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,109,398701,399001
12,Okay .,Marketing,110,399201,399561
12,I'll check what they exact mean .,User Interface,111,399761,401741
12,Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .,Marketing,112,401941,405121
12,So uh {disfmarker},User Interface,113,405321,406401
12,"Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost .",Industrial Designer,114,406601,411041
12,But maybe it's cheap,Industrial Designer,114,411241,412441
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,115,412641,413001
12,and it's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer,116,413201,414881
12,th that's the only problem .,User Interface,117,415081,416761
12,"I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh",User Interface,117,416961,421041
12,{gap},Marketing,118,421241,421541
12,"if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .",User Interface,119,421741,427501
12,Oh .,Marketing,120,427701,427941
12,It's mass production .,Marketing,120,428141,429461
12,"So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker}",Marketing,120,429661,432241
12,Since you have to uh configure speech thing .,User Interface,121,432441,435141
12,But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,122,435341,439361
12,"Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .",User Interface,123,439561,441961
12,Yeah .,Marketing,124,442161,442521
12,But how uh we we're gonna make many of those .,Marketing,124,442721,445481
12,"So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} .",Marketing,124,445681,450481
12,"Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah .",Project Manager,125,450681,453981
12,But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .,Project Manager,125,454181,458681
12,"Yeah , so uh we gotta de",User Interface,126,458881,460321
12,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,127,460521,461601
12,We have to decide on that .,User Interface,128,461801,463421
12,Yeah .,Marketing,129,463621,463981
12,Okay .,Marketing,129,464181,464541
12,That was this ?,Marketing,129,464741,465641
12,Mm uh {disfmarker},User Interface,130,465841,466921
12,"Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced .",Industrial Designer,131,467121,473001
12,And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip .,Industrial Designer,131,473201,478121
12,And this is more expensive than all the other chips .,Industrial Designer,131,478321,481501
12,So,Industrial Designer,131,481701,481821
12,L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker},User Interface,132,482021,484121
12,it's m the most expensive .,Industrial Designer,133,484321,485941
12,"Yeah , it says in the email .",Industrial Designer,133,486141,487881
12,The display requires an advanced chip .,Industrial Designer,133,488081,490421
12,Okay .,User Interface,134,490621,490981
12,And speech recognition ?,User Interface,134,491181,492621
12,"Yeah , probably too .",Industrial Designer,135,492821,494081
12,Advanced {gap} .,User Interface,136,494281,495241
12,Yeah .,User Interface,136,495441,495801
12,"I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,137,496001,500081
12,I'll I'll give you my design .,User Interface,138,500281,502081
12,"Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need .",Industrial Designer,139,502281,505821
12,If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .,Industrial Designer,139,506021,508661
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,140,508861,509521
12,So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design .,User Interface,140,509721,515361
12,So I did some searching on the internet .,User Interface,140,515561,518021
12,I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .,User Interface,140,518221,522961
12,I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .,User Interface,140,523161,528621
12,I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players .,User Interface,140,528821,532541
12,Mobile phones .,User Interface,140,532741,533641
12,"Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .",Project Manager,141,533841,536601
12,More modern .,User Interface,142,536801,537581
12,Y yes .,User Interface,142,537781,538201
12,Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller .,User Interface,142,538401,542241
12,"'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides .",User Interface,142,542441,548741
12,"And here you just have one , few buttons .",User Interface,142,548941,551461
12,So that's that's the main difference .,User Interface,142,551661,553941
12,But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this .,User Interface,142,554141,557501
12,"And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,142,557701,560281
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,143,560481,560781
12,"It's the most important part , I think .",User Interface,144,560981,563381
12,"But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple .",User Interface,144,563581,568261
12,Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit .,User Interface,144,568461,571581
12,Uh basic buttons .,User Interface,144,571781,572861
12,"On-off , mute .",User Interface,144,573061,573961
12,"And th maybe two others , I dunno .",User Interface,144,574161,576261
12,Text buttons .,User Interface,144,576461,577301
12,"Yeah , maybe the teletext tel",Project Manager,145,577501,579241
12,"Yeah , text button , maybe there and there .",User Interface,146,579441,582081
12,"And then the colour buttons , if we want it on .",User Interface,146,582281,585161
12,"I don't find it very usable ,",User Interface,146,585361,587101
12,No .,Project Manager,147,587301,587541
12,but it's {disfmarker},User Interface,148,587741,589001
12,"No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it .",Marketing,149,589201,591961
12,Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well .,User Interface,150,592161,595761
12,So {disfmarker},User Interface,150,595961,596861
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,151,597061,597361
12,"and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod .",User Interface,152,597561,601161
12,"They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four .",User Interface,152,601361,604901
12,And uh f above ten .,User Interface,152,605101,606301
12,{vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker},User Interface,152,606501,608721
12,But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display .,Industrial Designer,153,608921,611681
12,No no .,User Interface,154,611881,612301
12,That th there is no display there .,User Interface,154,612501,614601
12,But it's on the place of the display .,User Interface,154,614801,617081
12,And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .,User Interface,154,617281,621181
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,155,621381,621741
12,So the focus is on these two parts .,User Interface,156,621941,624101
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,157,624301,624661
12,So you don't see all the buttons you else need .,User Interface,158,624861,627741
12,{vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use .,Project Manager,159,627941,630941
12,Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .,Project Manager,159,631141,635281
12,Uh well um {disfmarker},User Interface,160,635481,636861
12,So you can't use your thumb for it .,Project Manager,161,637061,639221
12,This is how it is now .,User Interface,162,639421,640801
12,Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume .,User Interface,162,641001,644481
12,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,163,644681,645041
12,I think it is on uh on the bottom too .,Industrial Designer,164,645241,647581
12,down there .,Project Manager,165,647781,648501
12,But it's not not the best best .,Project Manager,165,648701,650621
12,Yeah .,User Interface,166,650821,651181
12,Well here we have also side scrolls .,User Interface,166,651381,653601
12,I dunno if we can use that .,User Interface,166,653801,655481
12,Do we want to use {disfmarker},User Interface,166,655681,657481
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,167,657681,658461
12,"Yeah , for volume .",Project Manager,168,658661,659801
12,"For volume , or a channel .",Project Manager,168,660001,661621
12,"Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .",Industrial Designer,169,661821,664641
12,"Yeah , why not .",Project Manager,170,664841,665801
12,For volume ?,User Interface,171,666001,666721
12,Well then we can even simplify it more .,User Interface,171,666921,669321
12,Scroll .,Industrial Designer,172,669521,670001
12,By just putting the volume on the side .,User Interface,173,670201,672601
12,And the channels as well .,Project Manager,174,672801,674361
12,And and just channel buttons here .,User Interface,175,674561,676661
12,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,176,676861,677401
12,But I think uh {disfmarker},User Interface,177,677601,679221
12,"Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used .",Industrial Designer,178,679421,683681
12,"And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .",Industrial Designer,178,683881,689761
12,Well .,User Interface,179,689961,690321
12,"Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here .",User Interface,179,690521,693881
12,"Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .",Industrial Designer,180,694081,700081
12,"Yeah , that's better .",Project Manager,181,700281,701601
12,They're on top ?,User Interface,182,701801,702761
12,"Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ .",Project Manager,183,702961,706021
12,Put that on the button bottom .,Project Manager,183,706221,708081
12,Because uh you can't hold it .,Industrial Designer,184,708281,710081
12,You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .,Industrial Designer,184,710281,713581
12,You mean uh these to the low ?,User Interface,185,713781,715581
12,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,186,715781,716261
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,186,716461,716821
12,Except from the on-off button .,Project Manager,186,717021,718881
12,Oh okay .,User Interface,187,719081,719621
12,"Well , yeah .",User Interface,187,719821,720601
12,"But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three .",Industrial Designer,188,720801,728541
12,So maybe we can put that on the bottom .,Industrial Designer,188,728741,731141
12,Mm {disfmarker} Maybe .,User Interface,189,731341,732721
12,"I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker}",User Interface,189,732921,735141
12,Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .,Industrial Designer,190,735341,738581
12,"Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below .",User Interface,191,738781,741301
12,It's harder to zap .,User Interface,191,741501,742701
12,So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} .,User Interface,191,742901,746021
12,"I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .",User Interface,191,746221,750061
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,192,750261,750921
12,"And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good .",User Interface,193,751121,756581
12,"That's that's good , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,194,756781,759001
12,"{vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .",User Interface,195,759201,764241
12,So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .,User Interface,195,764441,767501
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,196,767701,768361
12,But uh the position of course can be different .,User Interface,197,768561,771441
12,"It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .",User Interface,197,771641,776141
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,198,776341,776701
12,So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker},User Interface,199,776901,779361
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,200,779561,779861
12,"I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .",User Interface,201,780061,784561
12,"No , I think th the the top buttons are okay .",Industrial Designer,202,784761,787521
12,They sh Those should be on top .,Industrial Designer,202,787721,789641
12,Okay .,User Interface,203,789841,790201
12,"Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,203,790401,792681
12,"But uh we we can switch those two ,",Industrial Designer,204,792881,794981
12,"Those two , yeah .",User Interface,205,795181,796261
12,yeah .,Industrial Designer,206,796461,796821
12,"And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right .",User Interface,207,797021,804521
12,{gap},User Interface,207,804721,805021
12,Okay .,Marketing,208,805221,805581
12,Well that's that's my findings .,User Interface,209,805781,807701
12,So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look .,User Interface,209,807901,811801
12,M_P_ three player .,User Interface,209,812001,813141
12,"And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then .",User Interface,209,813341,821381
12,"I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .",User Interface,209,821581,827701
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,210,827901,828261
12,"Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager,210,828461,829661
12,To use {disfmarker},User Interface,211,829861,831001
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,212,831201,831561
12,"So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons .",User Interface,213,831761,836561
12,Which won't look good on the front side I think .,User Interface,213,836761,839701
12,Okay .,Project Manager,214,839901,840261
12,No .,Industrial Designer,215,840461,840701
12,So that's something we have to decide on .,User Interface,216,840901,843421
12,"Yeah , we have to keep it simple .",Industrial Designer,217,843621,845661
12,"We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .",Project Manager,218,845861,852101
12,Yeah .,User Interface,219,852301,852661
12,What we're gonna do .,User Interface,219,852861,854121
12,Okay .,User Interface,219,854321,854681
12,"Okay , the component design .",Industrial Designer,220,854881,856621
12,"I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge .",Industrial Designer,220,856821,861021
12,So uh this was on the web site .,Industrial Designer,220,861221,863141
12,"If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red .",Industrial Designer,220,863341,870301
12,So flashy kinda colours .,Industrial Designer,220,870501,872001
12,"Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes .",Industrial Designer,220,872201,874961
12,Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like .,Industrial Designer,220,875161,877441

12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,229,898401,899061
12,Not uh the old uh box look .,User Interface,229,899261,900941

12,"I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of",Industrial Designer,230,905201,910301
12,"Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control .",Project Manager,231,910501,916261
12,"looking , I think .",Industrial Designer,232,916461,917601
12,Mm .,Marketing,233,917801,918041

12,And this is all the wheel for volume .,Project Manager,524,1675421,1677701
12,"So that you just um {disfmarker} It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .",Project Manager,524,1677901,1682941

12,Uh wh what is the middle part ?,User Interface,546,1735221,1737081

12,Use the dz,User Interface,552,1754601,1755201

12,"So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty .",Project Manager,555,1767061,1771621
12,Because you have to hold it as well .,Project Manager,555,1771821,1774041

12,Why ?,Project Manager,565,1802641,1802941
12,Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,566,1803141,1807641

12,"Yeah , {gap} idea .",User Interface,730,2265761,2266901
12,But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker},User Interface,730,2267101,2272861
12,But i it is it is it is already fancy .,Project Manager,731,2273061,2275401
12,Because of the lights on the bottom of it .,Project Manager,731,2275601,2278181
12,That's already fancy .,Project Manager,731,2278381,2279701

12,Maybe the ones we are going to draw there .,Project Manager,748,2328421,2331001

13,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,114,529301,530441
13,"Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer .",Industrial Designer,114,530641,534121
13,"I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .",Industrial Designer,114,534321,541581
13,"So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities .",Industrial Designer,114,541781,550481
13,So that's one .,Industrial Designer,114,550681,551581
13,"{vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same .",Industrial Designer,114,551781,559701
13,Sorry about that .,Industrial Designer,114,559901,560981

13,Okay .,User Interface,115,570321,570681
13,I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion .,Industrial Designer,116,570881,578021
13,One thing about uh interopera operability .,Industrial Designer,116,578221,580801
13,Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment .,Industrial Designer,116,581001,587421
13,"Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .",Industrial Designer,116,587621,592361
13,So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .,Industrial Designer,116,592561,595921
13,And for a cell phone ?,User Interface,117,596121,597441
13,"Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .",Industrial Designer,118,597641,601961
13,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,119,602161,602941
13,Yeah .,User Interface,119,603141,603501
13,I think it could come in handy .,Industrial Designer,120,603701,605621
13,We should discuss that .,Industrial Designer,120,605821,607261
13,Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .,Industrial Designer,120,607461,613041
13,"We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh",Industrial Designer,120,613241,617981
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,121,618181,618901
13,is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore .,Industrial Designer,122,619101,622041
13,But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .,Industrial Designer,122,622241,625841
13,"But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .",User Interface,123,626041,633301
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,124,633501,633981
13,"But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so",User Interface,125,634181,637301
13,But it's cost-effective .,Industrial Designer,126,637501,639001
13,Yes .,Industrial Designer,126,639201,639501
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,126,639701,640181

13,y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .,User Interface,127,642141,644601
13,So that's the point .,Industrial Designer,128,644801,646061
13,Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker},User Interface,129,646261,648241
13,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,130,648441,649341
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,131,649541,650261
13,you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .,User Interface,132,650461,654301
13,"Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss",Industrial Designer,133,654501,657441
13,Yeah .,User Interface,134,657641,658001
13,and uh about every everybody should think about it .,Industrial Designer,135,658201,661321
13,"So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,",Industrial Designer,135,661521,673461
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,136,673661,674021
13,but take these things into account when you start the discussion .,Industrial Designer,137,674221,678181
13,"Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,",Project Manager,138,678381,684801
13,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer,139,685001,685301
13,and {disfmarker},Project Manager,140,685501,686461
13,"so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,",Industrial Designer,141,686661,692001
13,"Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,142,692201,694001
13,and the way of communicating with these equipments .,Industrial Designer,143,694201,697321
13,Okay .,Project Manager,144,697521,697881
13,"Okay , good .",Project Manager,144,698081,698861

13,Um {disfmarker} Mm .,Project Manager,148,709821,711021
13,Okay .,Project Manager,148,711221,711581
13,Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .,Project Manager,148,711781,715561
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,149,715761,716481
13,Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .,Project Manager,150,716681,721481
13,"Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role .",Project Manager,150,721681,729121
13,"Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part .",Project Manager,150,729321,735021
13,Um so let's start with you .,Project Manager,150,735221,736901
13,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,151,737101,737581
13,H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?,Project Manager,152,737781,741561
13,"Well , I had a few uh things in mind .",User Interface,153,741761,744041
13,"Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?",User Interface,153,744241,754861
13,Yep .,Project Manager,154,755061,755361
13,{vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .,User Interface,155,755561,762041
13,"Yes , I think it should be something like that .",Industrial Designer,156,762241,765121
13,"It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,",User Interface,157,765321,770781
13,"Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,",Project Manager,158,770981,773981
13,right ?,User Interface,159,774181,774601
13,not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker},Project Manager,160,774801,778701
13,"Yeah , I do I don't know that .",User Interface,161,778901,780761

13,Okay .,Project Manager,171,804761,805121
13,Okay .,Project Manager,171,805321,805681
13,"{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ .",User Interface,172,805881,816501
13,That's just the basic f technical function .,User Interface,172,816701,819341
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,173,819541,819901
13,So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session .,User Interface,174,820101,823941
13,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,174,824141,825041
13,So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker},Project Manager,175,825241,828961
13,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,176,829161,829521
13,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,176,829721,831221
13,"Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .",User Interface,177,831421,840721
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,178,840921,841401

13,Okay .,Project Manager,180,844201,844561
13,So that's it .,User Interface,181,844761,845601
13,Um but furthermore {disfmarker},User Interface,181,845801,847661
13,And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?,Industrial Designer,182,847861,851581
13,Yeah .,User Interface,183,851781,852141
13,"Yeah , with buttons .",User Interface,183,852341,853601

13,You know these things .,Industrial Designer,191,872301,873681
13,And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,191,873881,877361
13,They're very vu vulnerable .,User Interface,192,877561,879241
13,"w yes ,",Industrial Designer,193,879441,879861
13,Yeah .,User Interface,194,880061,880421
13,"to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .",Industrial Designer,195,880621,888781
13,"So maybe that's an idea ,",Industrial Designer,195,888981,890481
13,Yeah .,User Interface,196,890681,891041
13,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,197,891241,892081
13,"And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing .",User Interface,198,892281,896781
13,"Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,",User Interface,198,896981,903461
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,199,903661,904141
13,"so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}",User Interface,200,904341,908961

13,"Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah .",User Interface,208,931661,935261
13,"For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,",User Interface,208,935461,942841
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,209,943041,943521
13,"but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,210,943721,954041

13,But uh lots of devices already use infrared .,Marketing,242,1041361,1044061

14,No ?,Project Manager,57,190361,190601
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,57,190801,191941
14,"Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?",Project Manager,57,192141,197721
14,"Yeah , I'll start .",User Interface,58,197921,199061
14,Uh uh yeah .,Project Manager,59,199261,199981
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,59,200181,200541
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,60,200741,201041
14,great .,Project Manager,61,201241,201661
14,"Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show .",User Interface,62,201861,206181
14,Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .,User Interface,62,206381,208421
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,63,208621,209341
14,Uh yes .,User Interface,64,209541,210021
14,Alright .,User Interface,64,210221,210761
14,Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .,User Interface,64,210961,216241
14,{vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .,User Interface,64,216441,225681
14,So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .,User Interface,64,225881,230261
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,65,230461,230821
14,"Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .",User Interface,66,231021,243261
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,67,243461,243941
14,And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .,User Interface,68,244141,251101
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,69,251301,251661
14,{vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,70,251861,254381
14,"My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design .",User Interface,70,254581,265381
14,But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .,User Interface,70,265581,270741
14,Uh-huh .,Project Manager,71,270941,271421
14,So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design .,User Interface,72,271621,275881
14,"But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design .",User Interface,72,276081,282081
14,"So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so .",User Interface,72,282281,285581
14,"But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .",User Interface,72,285781,292441
14,Okay .,Project Manager,73,292641,293001
14,"Uh Ruud , did you get that ?",Project Manager,73,293201,294881
14,Yeah .,User Interface,74,295081,295441
14,"Yeah , uh b uh most .",Marketing,75,295641,296901
14,"Okay , so",Project Manager,76,297101,297641
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,77,297841,298561
14,the important thing here is {disfmarker},Project Manager,78,298761,301161
14,{vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .,User Interface,79,301361,306221
14,"Oh , user-friendly .",Marketing,80,306421,307621
14,"In the market , yeah .",Project Manager,81,307821,309141
14,"Yeah , what what does the market want ?",User Interface,82,309341,311681
14,I I don't know .,User Interface,82,311881,312841
14,"Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,83,313041,315921
14,Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .,User Interface,84,316121,322661
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,85,322861,323221
14,Okay .,Project Manager,85,323421,323781
14,Sebastian .,Project Manager,85,323981,324641
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,86,324841,325981
14,{vocalsound} Excuse me .,Industrial Designer,86,326181,327621
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,86,327821,328541
14,{vocalsound} Scusi .,User Interface,87,328741,329941
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,87,330141,330861
14,"Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing .",Industrial Designer,88,331061,334121
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,88,334321,334681
14,"Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .",Industrial Designer,88,334881,341361
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,89,341561,342281
14,Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set .,Industrial Designer,90,342481,346741
14,And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set .,Industrial Designer,90,346941,352461
14,"Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,",Industrial Designer,90,352661,355781
14,Energies and uh {disfmarker},User Interface,91,355981,357661
14,but it's hardly readable .,Industrial Designer,92,357861,359421
14,Can you see it ?,Industrial Designer,92,359621,360581
14,"No , it's not visible .",Project Manager,93,360781,362161
14,No ?,Industrial Designer,94,362361,362601
14,"Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here .",Industrial Designer,94,362801,365981
14,{vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things .,Industrial Designer,94,366181,371041
14,"The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .",Industrial Designer,94,371241,380781
14,That's basically the idea .,Industrial Designer,94,380981,382601
14,"And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .",Industrial Designer,94,382801,389221
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,94,389421,390561
14,Um what have I found .,Industrial Designer,94,390761,392081
14,"Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .",Industrial Designer,94,392281,398641
14,That's all .,Industrial Designer,94,398841,399561
14,"It's cased together , nothing more than that .",Industrial Designer,94,399761,402521
14,{vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .,Industrial Designer,94,402721,409321
14,Yeah .,User Interface,95,409521,409881
14,"There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls .",Industrial Designer,96,410081,414341
14,And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons .,Industrial Designer,96,414541,418381
14,And I think that's what we w,Industrial Designer,96,418581,420261
14,The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .,User Interface,97,420461,423401
14,yes .,Industrial Designer,98,423601,423901
14,In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also .,Industrial Designer,98,424101,429261
14,So maybe we should consider that .,Industrial Designer,98,429461,431501
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,98,431701,432421
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,99,432621,432981
14,Okay .,Project Manager,99,433181,433541
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,100,433741,434101
14,I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented .,Industrial Designer,100,434301,438021
14,Um basically this is all there is .,Industrial Designer,100,438221,440321
14,There's just one chip .,Industrial Designer,100,440521,441901
14,There are a few buttons connected .,Industrial Designer,100,442101,444201
14,Uh the buttons are lit .,Industrial Designer,100,444401,445841
14,"And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .",Industrial Designer,100,446041,451921
14,{vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .,Industrial Designer,100,452121,456801
14,So it's fairly easy .,Project Manager,101,457001,458261
14,There's nothing more to it .,Industrial Designer,102,458461,460141
14,It's fairly easy .,Industrial Designer,102,460341,461421
14,"It's been done many times before ,",Industrial Designer,102,461621,463661
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,103,463861,465001
14,{vocalsound} Succeed in it also .,User Interface,104,465201,467181
14,and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .,Industrial Designer,105,467381,471821
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,106,472021,472741
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,107,472941,473301
14,"So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh",Industrial Designer,108,473501,475961
14,good .,Project Manager,109,476161,476521
14,"personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set .",Industrial Designer,110,476721,484821
14,So I think that uh should be clear .,Industrial Designer,110,485021,487181
14,Okay .,Project Manager,111,487381,487741
14,"Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components .",Industrial Designer,112,487941,493761
14,Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components .,Industrial Designer,112,493961,501761
14,"And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .",Industrial Designer,112,501961,508681
14,"{vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .",Industrial Designer,112,508881,519561
14,Okay .,Project Manager,113,519761,520121
14,"And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .",Industrial Designer,114,520321,529081
14,{vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker},User Interface,115,529281,531861
14,I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .,Industrial Designer,116,532061,535601
14,"if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}",User Interface,117,535801,539821
14,"No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .",Industrial Designer,118,540021,542781
14,Okay .,User Interface,119,542981,543341
14,So we can use them .,Industrial Designer,120,543541,544741
14,So that's no problem .,Industrial Designer,120,544941,546261
14,"For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker}",User Interface,121,546461,549761
14,"Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,122,549961,555481
14,Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker},User Interface,123,555681,559521
14,We can we can make its I think .,Industrial Designer,124,559721,561641
14,Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most .,Marketing,125,561841,566881
14,"So , the channel switching .",Marketing,125,567081,568761
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,126,568961,569321
14,Yeah .,User Interface,127,569521,569881
14,"Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .",Project Manager,128,570081,581001
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing,129,581201,582101
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,130,582301,582661
14,But I think {disfmarker},User Interface,131,582861,584301
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,132,584501,584801
14,"Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,",User Interface,133,585001,592021
14,"Hmm , true .",Marketing,134,592221,592941
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,134,593141,593861
14,and not for {disfmarker},User Interface,135,594061,595501
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,136,595701,596001
14,"Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .",Industrial Designer,136,596201,601961
14,"Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .",User Interface,137,602161,605161
14,"No no no , no .",Industrial Designer,138,605361,606261
14,"That's right , that's right .",Industrial Designer,138,606461,608201
14,Okay .,Project Manager,139,608401,608761
14,"So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it .",Industrial Designer,140,608961,611661
14,Okay .,Project Manager,141,611861,612221
14,{vocalsound} Um have a think about it .,Industrial Designer,142,612421,614761
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,143,614961,615321
14,"Okay , Ruud .",Project Manager,143,615521,616301
14,"Oh , mine is already outdated .",Marketing,144,616501,618361
14,"Okay well ,",Project Manager,145,618561,619221
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,146,619421,620141
14,we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .,Project Manager,147,620341,625501
14,{vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker},Marketing,148,625701,627741
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,149,627941,628661
14,So any income is welcome .,Project Manager,150,628861,630421
14,{vocalsound} Input .,Project Manager,150,630621,631821
14,"Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .",Marketing,151,632021,638201
14,Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .,Marketing,151,638401,644101
14,Okay .,Project Manager,152,644301,644661
14,Could you step a little bit more to the right ?,User Interface,153,644861,647681
14,"{vocalsound} Yeah , thank you .",User Interface,153,647881,649741
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,153,649941,650661
14,"But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market .",Marketing,154,650861,659441
14,"But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .",Marketing,154,659641,663841
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,155,664041,664761
14,"Uh well , skip this .",Marketing,156,664961,666221
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,156,666421,667141
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,157,667341,667701
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,157,667901,668621
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,158,668821,669541
14,"Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course .",Marketing,159,669741,672921
14,That they only use ten percent the buttons .,Marketing,159,673121,675761
14,"The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time .",Marketing,159,675961,683521
14,And the volume button's only four times .,Marketing,159,683721,686181
14,So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons .,Marketing,159,686381,689741
14,And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .,Marketing,159,689941,694441
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer,160,694641,694881
14,So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .,Marketing,161,695081,698621
14,Some uh audio signal .,Marketing,161,698821,700141
14,Like uh home phones .,Marketing,161,700341,701601
14,Okay .,Project Manager,162,701801,702161
14,"Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager,162,702361,703981
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing,163,704181,705081
14,"Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function ,",Industrial Designer,164,705281,707861
14,Yeah .,User Interface,165,708061,708421
14,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,166,708621,708981
14,you know .,Industrial Designer,167,709181,709781
14,that's definitely interesting .,Project Manager,168,709981,711841
14,That's quite a {disfmarker} yes .,Industrial Designer,169,712041,714021
14,It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .,Project Manager,170,714221,717521
14,Sound signal .,User Interface,171,717721,718561
14,Yeah .,Marketing,172,718761,719121
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,173,719321,719681
14,Yeah .,User Interface,174,719881,720241
14,go on .,Project Manager,175,720441,720861
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,176,721061,721361
14,"Well , I just said that .",Marketing,177,721561,723061
14,"And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it .",Marketing,177,723261,727041
14,Okay .,Project Manager,178,727241,727601
14,So that's what the market tells us .,Project Manager,178,727801,729961
14,"Uh that's about it , yes .",Marketing,179,730161,731721
14,Yep .,Project Manager,180,731921,732221
14,Okay .,Project Manager,180,732421,732781
14,The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .,User Interface,181,732981,736281
14,Uh mo uh zap buttons most .,Marketing,182,736481,738101
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface,183,738301,739201
14,"Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot .",Marketing,184,739401,741681
14,But more than all the other buttons .,Marketing,184,741881,744101
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,184,744301,745201
14,"Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons .",User Interface,185,745401,752361
14,And first um {disfmarker},User Interface,185,752561,754061
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,186,754261,754561
14,"Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .",Industrial Designer,186,754761,757221
14,Yeah .,User Interface,187,757421,757781
14,Yep .,Project Manager,188,757981,758281
14,"Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties .",Industrial Designer,189,758481,764541
14,There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment .,Industrial Designer,189,764741,769061
14,So um I don't think we have any hiccups there .,Industrial Designer,189,769261,772081
14,So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs .,Industrial Designer,189,772281,777861
14,So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .,Industrial Designer,189,778061,783221
14,"Yeah , the sound signal .",User Interface,190,783421,784921
14,"Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?",User Interface,190,785121,791721
14,Well,Industrial Designer,191,791921,792161
14,"Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem .",Marketing,192,792361,795601
14,Yeah .,Marketing,192,795801,796161
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,192,796361,797081
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,193,797281,797581
14,{vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem .,Industrial Designer,193,797781,801561
14,{vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .,User Interface,194,801761,804581
14,Well,Project Manager,195,804781,805021
14,Usually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,196,805221,806421
14,"maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",Project Manager,197,806621,809081
14,It should be uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface,198,809281,811141
14,like um turning on and off the the the lights .,Project Manager,199,811341,814161
14,Oh yes .,Industrial Designer,200,814361,814841
14,"Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .",User Interface,201,815041,818701
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,202,818901,819201
14,"Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already .",Industrial Designer,202,819401,824141
14,"Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button .",Industrial Designer,202,824341,830101
14,"You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .",Industrial Designer,202,830301,837561
14,Reports rep respend response to it .,Project Manager,203,837761,839921
14,And um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,204,840121,841261
14,"just like uh the phones Yeah ,",User Interface,205,841461,843261
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,206,843461,843761
14,"Yes , that's it .",Industrial Designer,206,843961,844981
14,"Yes , same thing .",Industrial Designer,206,845181,846261
14,the {disfmarker},User Interface,207,846461,847421
14,Yeah .,Marketing,208,847621,847981
14,But uh th,Project Manager,209,848181,848721
14,But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons .,User Interface,210,848921,851561
14,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,210,851761,852661
14,"No , so we we should use something else .",Industrial Designer,211,852861,855321
14,And you {disfmarker},Marketing,212,855521,856721
14,"Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,213,856921,860521
14,But I believe you will have an {disfmarker},User Interface,214,860721,863301
14,"Yeah , and usually {disfmarker}",Marketing,215,863501,865361
14,We do not control the T_V_ set so well .,Industrial Designer,216,865561,867961
14,"And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,",Marketing,217,868161,873681
14,"Yes , m yes .",Industrial Designer,218,873881,874661
14,"S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers ,",Industrial Designer,218,874861,880801
14,and it's {disfmarker},Marketing,219,881001,882261
14,Okay .,Project Manager,220,882461,882821
14,so we should think about {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,221,883021,885241
14,So what about the clapping technique ?,Project Manager,222,885441,887721
14,Um because you se,Project Manager,222,887921,888941
14,I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .,User Interface,223,889141,892981
14,{vocalsound} It's quite complicated .,Industrial Designer,224,893181,895401
14,"Well , it's quite complicated .",Industrial Designer,224,895601,897461
14,Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .,Industrial Designer,224,897661,901681
14,{vocalsound} And b,Marketing,225,901881,902961
14,"Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,226,903161,907181
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,227,907381,908041
14,"Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,",Industrial Designer,227,908241,916401
14,"Yeah , a peak .",Project Manager,228,916601,917501
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,228,917701,918061
14,which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .,Industrial Designer,229,918261,922461
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,230,922661,923021
14,But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .,Industrial Designer,231,923221,929701
14,"So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .",Marketing,232,929901,933681
14,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager,233,933881,935081
14,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer,234,935281,935581
14,But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ .,User Interface,235,935781,940401
14,Just a little antenna or uh something .,User Interface,235,940601,942941
14,so we don't want that .,Industrial Designer,236,943141,944521
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,237,944721,945441
14,Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that .,Industrial Designer,238,945641,948461
14,Well if you lost th,User Interface,239,948661,949801
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer,240,950001,950361
14,Well uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,241,950561,951761
14,is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,242,951961,955501
14,I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .,User Interface,243,955701,963201
14,"Well , I don't think uh {gap} .",Industrial Designer,244,963401,965261
14,Uh that's just uh {disfmarker},User Interface,245,965461,967261
14,"No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} .",Industrial Designer,246,967461,976521
14,"And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,",Industrial Designer,246,976721,979721
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,247,979921,980281
14,so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that .,Industrial Designer,248,980481,984981
14,"You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .",Industrial Designer,248,985181,993881
14,{gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .,User Interface,249,994081,998161
14,"Yes , something like that .",Industrial Designer,250,998361,999981
14,"But that will be very costly , I think .",Industrial Designer,250,1000181,1002581
14,"Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .",Project Manager,251,1002781,1012561
14,So that's not a good idea .,Industrial Designer,252,1012761,1014381
14,Yeah .,Marketing,253,1014581,1014941
14,"Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,",Project Manager,254,1015141,1020601
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,255,1020801,1021281
14,I will .,Industrial Designer,255,1021481,1021961
14,Yeah .,User Interface,256,1022161,1022521
14,because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .,Project Manager,257,1022721,1026081
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,258,1026281,1026581
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,258,1026781,1027081
14,But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated,Industrial Designer,258,1027281,1035921
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,259,1036121,1036601
14,um and it will become more costly also .,Industrial Designer,260,1036801,1039201
14,Yep .,Project Manager,261,1039401,1039701
14,Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used .,Industrial Designer,262,1039901,1044281
14,And there are some implepe imp,Industrial Designer,262,1044481,1046281
14,"And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?",User Interface,263,1046481,1051461
14,"Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .",Industrial Designer,264,1051661,1058081
14,It's a unique item uh {disfmarker},User Interface,265,1058281,1060321
14,"Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .",Project Manager,266,1060521,1062981
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,267,1063181,1064081
14,It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .,User Interface,268,1064281,1068301
14,It's a different {disfmarker} exactly .,Project Manager,269,1068501,1070841
14,"It's an uni an unique feature ,",Project Manager,269,1071041,1072901
14,Yeah .,Marketing,270,1073101,1073461
14,Yeah .,User Interface,271,1073661,1074021
14,and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .,Project Manager,272,1074221,1081241
14,"And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .",User Interface,273,1081441,1088941
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,274,1089141,1089501
14,What should we choose in in design ?,User Interface,275,1089701,1091861
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,276,1092061,1092421
14,"Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .",Project Manager,276,1092621,1098261
14,"Well , the extra functions .",User Interface,277,1098461,1100141
14,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,278,1100341,1101241
14,I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .,Marketing,279,1101441,1104561
14,Okay .,Project Manager,280,1104761,1105121
14,"Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .",Marketing,281,1105321,1112101
14,Used option .,User Interface,282,1112301,1113081
14,Okay .,Project Manager,283,1113281,1113641
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,283,1113841,1114561
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,284,1114761,1115901
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,284,1116101,1116821
14,"Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .",Project Manager,285,1117021,1120921
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,285,1121121,1121841
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,286,1122041,1122761
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,287,1122961,1123681
14,"Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .",Marketing,288,1123881,1128621
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,289,1128821,1129181
14,"Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .",Project Manager,289,1129381,1135321
14,So {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,290,1135521,1136841
14,Yeah .,Marketing,290,1137041,1137401
14,"Well , we skip that .",Project Manager,291,1137601,1138861
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,292,1139061,1139961
14,Okay .,Project Manager,293,1140161,1140521
14,"Well , so it just th the basic functions .",User Interface,294,1140721,1143241
14,And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .,User Interface,294,1143441,1147821
14,"No , no .",Industrial Designer,295,1148021,1148561
14,No .,Project Manager,296,1148761,1149001
14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,297,1149201,1150881
14,Nope .,Marketing,298,1151081,1151441
14,So that's out of the question .,Industrial Designer,299,1151641,1153501
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,300,1153701,1154061
14,Yeah .,User Interface,301,1154261,1154621
14,Just through uh the easy uh design .,User Interface,301,1154821,1156981
14,We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .,User Interface,301,1157181,1161801
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,302,1162001,1162901
14,Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .,Project Manager,303,1163101,1166101
14,I think also .,Industrial Designer,304,1166301,1167141
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,304,1167341,1167641
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer,304,1167841,1168201
14,No .,Project Manager,305,1168401,1168641
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface,306,1168841,1169741
14,we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface,Industrial Designer,307,1169941,1181281
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,308,1181481,1181841
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,308,1182041,1182401
14,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,309,1182601,1183561
14,"Ruud , how do you feel about that ?",Project Manager,310,1183761,1185861
14,"Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker}",Project Manager,310,1186061,1191401
14,"Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might ,",Marketing,311,1191601,1197841
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,312,1198041,1198521
14,'cause young people uh like new features .,Marketing,313,1198721,1201241
14,Mm yeah .,Project Manager,314,1201441,1201981
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,315,1202181,1203081
14,"Yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer,316,1203281,1204541
14,"Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,317,1204741,1207381
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer,318,1207581,1207821
14,"Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .",User Interface,319,1208021,1212881
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,320,1213081,1213441
14,"Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility .",Industrial Designer,320,1213641,1217301
14,"You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .",Industrial Designer,320,1217501,1224641
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,321,1224841,1225201
14,"Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,322,1225401,1234821
14,"But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh",Project Manager,323,1235021,1246901
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,324,1247101,1247581
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,324,1247781,1248261
14,Ok like that .,Industrial Designer,324,1248461,1249301
14,"Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that .",Industrial Designer,324,1249501,1256881
14,I don't know if if it's user-friendly .,Industrial Designer,324,1257081,1259421
14,That's your field of expertise .,Industrial Designer,324,1259621,1261541
14,But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?,Project Manager,325,1261741,1267741
14,"Yeah , I don't know yet .",User Interface,326,1267941,1269441
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,326,1269641,1270361
14,Because we do not implement uh a user history .,Project Manager,327,1270561,1273381
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,328,1273581,1274061
14,"There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .",Industrial Designer,328,1274261,1280921
14,"I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,329,1281121,1285561
14,W Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,330,1285761,1286361
14,"Well , maybe we can use a light for that .",Industrial Designer,330,1286561,1289081
14,"When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up .",Industrial Designer,330,1289281,1294381
14,"So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume .",Industrial Designer,330,1294581,1300581
14,Something like that .,Industrial Designer,330,1300781,1302041
14,"And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .",Marketing,331,1302241,1310281
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,332,1310481,1310841
14,Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .,Project Manager,332,1311041,1315481
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,333,1315681,1315981
14,"But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,",User Interface,334,1316181,1323921
14,"Yeah , draw draw it on the board .",Project Manager,335,1324121,1326161
14,"should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank .",User Interface,336,1326361,1331641
14,Oh .,User Interface,336,1331841,1332081
14,"yeah , something like that .",Industrial Designer,337,1332281,1333961
14,Oh,Industrial Designer,337,1334161,1334281
14,It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions .,User Interface,338,1334481,1340721
14,Instead of a stick .,User Interface,338,1340921,1342121
14,"It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes .",Industrial Designer,339,1342321,1345201
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,339,1345401,1345701
14,A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down,User Interface,340,1345901,1349201
14,"Yeah , it can break down .",Project Manager,341,1349401,1350961
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,342,1351161,1351461
14,or uh,User Interface,343,1351661,1351961
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,344,1352161,1352821
14,"just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .",User Interface,345,1353021,1356261

14,But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .,Project Manager,425,1636321,1639321

14,"Exactly , exactly .",Project Manager,449,1703721,1704861
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,450,1705061,1705421
14,And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it .,Marketing,451,1705621,1711681

14,"Okay , speech .",Project Manager,452,1717961,1718861

14,Yeah .,User Interface,454,1723221,1723581

14,That's one thing .,Industrial Designer,455,1730581,1731661
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,456,1731861,1732221
14,And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .,Industrial Designer,457,1732421,1735481
14,To find {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,458,1735681,1737301

14,Yeah .,Marketing,460,1742021,1742381
14,Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits,Project Manager,461,1742581,1745761
14,But maybe when we uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,462,1745961,1747941
14,"but keep the programme and the volume ,",Project Manager,463,1748141,1750481
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,464,1750681,1751161
14,"because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,465,1751361,1755921
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,466,1756121,1756481

14,Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition .,Marketing,467,1757661,1761081
14,So then we should implement such a but,Marketing,467,1761281,1763561
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,468,1763761,1764121
14,But we do focus on younger people .,Project Manager,468,1764321,1766421
14,We d it it's a board uh decision .,Project Manager,468,1766621,1768661
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,469,1768861,1769221
14,Yes .,Marketing,470,1769421,1769721

14,"I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .",Industrial Designer,471,1770481,1774441
14,So,User Interface,472,1774641,1774761
14,Okay .,Project Manager,473,1774961,1775321
14,we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .,User Interface,474,1775521,1780561
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,475,1780761,1781061
14,"Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage .",Industrial Designer,475,1781261,1785461
14,It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function .,Industrial Designer,475,1785661,1793761
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,476,1793961,1794441
14,Okay .,Project Manager,477,1794641,1795001
14,"So that's that's a big advantage , I think .",Industrial Designer,478,1795201,1797841
14,"Okay , g good .",Project Manager,479,1798041,1798941
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,480,1799141,1799861
14,Okay .,Project Manager,481,1800061,1800421
14,There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this .,Industrial Designer,482,1800621,1803921
14,Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult .,Industrial Designer,482,1804121,1807901
14,So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .,Industrial Designer,482,1808101,1812481
14,Mm .,Project Manager,483,1812681,1812921
14,But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it .,Industrial Designer,484,1813121,1817261
14,Yep .,Project Manager,485,1817461,1817761
14,There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .,Industrial Designer,486,1817961,1823961
14,Okay .,Project Manager,487,1824161,1824521
14,"So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .",Industrial Designer,488,1824721,1829281
14,But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?,Project Manager,489,1829481,1833261
14,You have to do nothing for it .,Industrial Designer,490,1833461,1835321

14,Yeah .,Marketing,502,1875381,1875741
14,They're very cheap .,Industrial Designer,503,1875941,1877141
14,Okay .,Project Manager,504,1877341,1877701
14,So it will cost us p practically nothing .,Industrial Designer,505,1877901,1880421
14,Okay .,Project Manager,506,1880621,1880981
14,We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting .,Project Manager,506,1881181,1884241
14,"Um {vocalsound} I would like to hear um {disfmarker} maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important .",Project Manager,506,1884441,1893081
14,"Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data .",Project Manager,506,1893281,1897001
14,Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?,Project Manager,506,1897201,1900741
14,Um I think we dealt with the most important information .,Marketing,507,1900941,1904361
14,Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to .,Marketing,507,1904561,1910021
14,So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .,Marketing,507,1910221,1914241
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,508,1914441,1915161
14,Okay .,Project Manager,509,1915361,1915721
14,"But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too .",Marketing,510,1915921,1921081
14,So {disfmarker} I don't think that's a big problem,Marketing,510,1921281,1924281
14,Okay .,Project Manager,511,1924481,1924841
14,"Okay , so",Project Manager,511,1925041,1925581
14,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,512,1925781,1926141
14,although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh {disfmarker} Profitable .,Project Manager,513,1926341,1932341
14,"We we {disfmarker} yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",Project Manager,513,1932541,1937641
14,Yes .,Marketing,514,1937841,1938141
14,"Yeah , profitable .",Marketing,514,1938341,1939481
14,Profitable .,Industrial Designer,515,1939681,1940401
14,Okay .,Project Manager,516,1940601,1940961
14,Yes .,Marketing,517,1941161,1941461
14,O okay .,Project Manager,518,1941661,1942141
14,{vocalsound} Um Roo .,Project Manager,518,1942341,1943601
14,{gap} {disfmarker} Nothing to add .,Project Manager,518,1943801,1945901
14,"I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .",User Interface,519,1946101,1948741
14,Sebastian ?,Project Manager,520,1948941,1949601
14,Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities .,Industrial Designer,521,1949801,1955621
14,Um,Industrial Designer,521,1955821,1955941
14,Yeah ?,Project Manager,522,1956141,1956501
14,Great .,Project Manager,522,1956701,1957121
14,so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design .,Industrial Designer,523,1957321,1961581
14,"So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .",Industrial Designer,523,1961781,1967961
14,So that's one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} those are the choices we have to make .,Industrial Designer,523,1968161,1973141
14,"But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that {disfmarker} these kinds of things .",Industrial Designer,523,1973341,1983541
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,524,1983741,1984221
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,524,1984421,1984781
14,"Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience .",Industrial Designer,525,1984981,1989301
14,"Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like .",Industrial Designer,525,1989501,1999461
14,"The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .",Industrial Designer,525,1999661,2007581
14,Yep .,Project Manager,526,2007781,2008081
14,Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not {disfmarker} do not implement these buttons .,Industrial Designer,527,2008281,2016321
14,"{vocalsound} If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap .",Industrial Designer,527,2016521,2024081
14,So that's another {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,527,2024281,2026081
14,"Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ?",Project Manager,528,2026281,2028921
14,The the board {disfmarker},Project Manager,528,2029121,2030681
14,"well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .",Industrial Designer,529,2030881,2038861
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,530,2039061,2039421
14,And this even uh makes it more cheapy .,Industrial Designer,531,2039621,2041961
14,But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?,User Interface,532,2042161,2045641
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,533,2045841,2046321
14,The board .,Project Manager,534,2046521,2047181
14,The circuit board .,User Interface,535,2047381,2048521
14,The circuit board .,Industrial Designer,536,2048721,2049861
14,The fewer buttons you can use on it .,User Interface,537,2050061,2052281
14,"No , it's th",Project Manager,538,2052481,2053201
14,"The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .",Industrial Designer,539,2053401,2057961
14,yeah .,Project Manager,540,2058161,2058521
14,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,541,2058721,2059501
14,"It's the other way around , yeah .",Project Manager,542,2059701,2061741
14,Yeah .,User Interface,543,2061941,2062301
14,"And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip .",Industrial Designer,544,2062501,2067061
14,So that's that's another advantage .,Industrial Designer,544,2067261,2069421
14,It shouldn't be a big issue .,Project Manager,545,2069621,2071361
14,Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition .,User Interface,546,2071561,2079181
14,"So {disfmarker} Yes , because I don't know {disfmarker} Yes .",Industrial Designer,547,2079381,2083041
14,I d I really don't know .,Industrial Designer,547,2083241,2084741
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,547,2084941,2085841
14,No .,User Interface,548,2086041,2086281
14,Okay .,Project Manager,549,2086481,2086841
14,It can be costly .,Industrial Designer,550,2087041,2088121
14,Maybe not .,Industrial Designer,550,2088321,2088981
14,"I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it .",Project Manager,551,2089181,2093981
14,Maybe you will get some information on that .,Project Manager,551,2094181,2096881
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,552,2097081,2097381
14,Um I'm not sure how how that {disfmarker},Project Manager,553,2097581,2100041
14,"Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh {vocalsound} have a lo uh look at it .",Industrial Designer,554,2100241,2105281

14,And um,Project Manager,569,2162601,2162961
14,Uh the only problem is it {disfmarker} that it depends on the divisions {disfmarker} the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes .,User Interface,570,2163161,2170661
14,About the voice recognition .,User Interface,570,2170861,2172601

14,that's w w what we concluded .,Project Manager,574,2177901,2179701
14,It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons .,Project Manager,574,2179901,2183321
14,S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one .,Project Manager,574,2183521,2186341

14,Yeah .,User Interface,576,2190661,2191021
14,I think that's what we decided .,Project Manager,577,2191221,2193141
14,So we drop the voice recognition ?,Industrial Designer,578,2193341,2195381
14,"No no no , we didn't {disfmarker}",Project Manager,579,2195581,2197561
14,Or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,580,2197761,2198661
14,but it shouldn't be integrated {disfmarker},Project Manager,581,2198861,2201441
14,Oh .,Industrial Designer,582,2201641,2201881
14,"yeah , it's {disfmarker} of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,583,2202081,2209461
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,584,2209661,2210021

16,"Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,",Marketing,345,912301,921181
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,346,921381,921741
16,"uh it has to lay good in the hand ,",Marketing,347,921941,924041
16,Yeah .,User Interface,348,924241,924601
16,you you have to uh {disfmarker},Marketing,349,924801,926661
16,Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control,Project Manager,350,926861,934301
16,"Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know",Marketing,351,934501,936901
16,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,352,937101,938001
16,"Well I think we have to look at that ,",User Interface,353,938201,940481
16,if we {disfmarker},Marketing,354,940681,941761
16,"'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}",User Interface,355,941961,946701
16,"You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,",Marketing,356,946901,950441
16,Yeah,Project Manager,357,950641,950881
16,but it's very hard to {disfmarker},Marketing,358,951081,953121
16,"N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .",Industrial Designer,359,953321,959441
16,"Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .",User Interface,360,959641,972661
16,Nah .,Marketing,361,972861,973161
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,362,973361,973721
16,"But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .",User Interface,363,973921,981721
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,364,981921,982281
16,"So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,",User Interface,365,982481,986621
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,366,986821,987181
16,so you can do something unique with that .,User Interface,367,987381,989901
16,"And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .",Industrial Designer,368,990101,1001981
16,"Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .",Marketing,369,1002181,1004341
16,"Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .",Project Manager,370,1004541,1008681
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,371,1008881,1009241
16,"Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,",Marketing,372,1009441,1012261
16,But n {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,373,1012461,1013541
16,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,374,1013741,1014521
16,"yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,",Industrial Designer,375,1014721,1020841
16,and if you fold it open {disfmarker},Marketing,376,1021041,1023201
16,But maybe it's,Project Manager,377,1023401,1024241
16,Yeah {gap} .,User Interface,378,1024441,1025161
16,{gap},Marketing,379,1025361,1025661
16,That's what I meant .,User Interface,380,1025861,1027121
16,so .,Industrial Designer,381,1027321,1027561
16,maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ?,Project Manager,382,1027761,1034541
16,Mm .,Marketing,383,1034741,1034981
16,If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .,Marketing,383,1035181,1043041
16,{gap} Maybe it's hard t,Project Manager,384,1043241,1044621
16,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,385,1044821,1045721
16,"No , that's right .",Project Manager,386,1045921,1047061
16,"So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} .",Project Manager,386,1047261,1052481
16,"Okay , but yeah .",User Interface,387,1052681,1053701
16,Just think about it .,Project Manager,388,1053901,1055161

17,"Okay , so .",User Interface,44,85181,85841
17,The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .,User Interface,44,86041,92401
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,45,92601,92961
17,Uh I I will focus on user interface design .,User Interface,46,93161,95801
17,Mm .,Project Manager,47,96001,96241
17,Um so move to the next slide .,User Interface,48,96441,98241
17,"As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .",User Interface,48,98441,106901
17,There's a lot of functions .,User Interface,48,107101,108781
17,"Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control .",User Interface,48,108981,113601
17,So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?,User Interface,48,113801,119201
17,"Um , let's move to next slide .",User Interface,48,119401,121261
17,Um .,User Interface,48,121461,121701
17,Yeah .,User Interface,48,121901,122261
17,"So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .",User Interface,48,122461,127321
17,A very good example is Google .,User Interface,48,127521,129381
17,"As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .",User Interface,48,129581,136841
17,Um so move to next s slide .,User Interface,48,137041,138721
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,49,138921,139641
17,So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .,User Interface,50,139841,149021
17,So {disfmarker},User Interface,50,149221,150121
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,51,150321,151041
17,That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation .,User Interface,52,151241,155381
17,So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .,Project Manager,53,155581,159721
17,"Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions ,",User Interface,54,159921,162681
17,"So powerful ,",Project Manager,55,162881,163661
17,but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful .,User Interface,56,163861,166381
17,many functions and very easy to use .,Project Manager,57,166581,168801
17,Yes .,User Interface,58,169001,169301
17,Yep .,User Interface,58,169501,169801
17,"So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,",Marketing,59,170001,173001
17,To merge the two system huh .,Industrial Designer,60,173201,174941
17,I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple,Marketing,61,175141,178381
17,Yeah .,User Interface,62,178581,178941
17,Yeah .,Marketing,63,179141,179501
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,64,179701,180421
17,You mean this one ?,Project Manager,65,180621,181761
17,Yeah .,Marketing,66,181961,182321
17,"Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .",Project Manager,67,182521,187321
17,Mm yep .,Industrial Designer,68,187521,188001
17,{gap},Marketing,69,188201,188501
17,But But this is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,70,188701,190381
17,But if we have very very good user interface,User Interface,71,190581,193221
17,"Yeah ,",Marketing,72,193421,193781
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,73,193981,194341
17,and then {disfmarker},Marketing,74,194541,195801
17,it take less time for user to learn how to use it .,User Interface,75,196001,199061
17,Yeah .,Marketing,76,199261,199621
17,"Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign .",Industrial Designer,77,199821,209901
17,Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?,Project Manager,78,210101,213761
17,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,79,213961,214741
17,"For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .",Industrial Designer,79,214941,223881
17,"Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah .",Marketing,80,224081,226421
17,The user should know .,Marketing,80,226621,227941
17,"So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So .",Industrial Designer,81,228141,237981
17,Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker},Project Manager,82,238181,240461
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,83,240661,241021
17,So .,Industrial Designer,83,241221,241461
17,"Go on , go back and {disfmarker}",Project Manager,84,241661,243581
17,"Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .",Industrial Designer,85,243781,249301
17,"Yeah , that's gonna be the trick .",Marketing,86,249501,251541
17,{vocalsound},Marketing,86,251741,252461
17,"Yeah , that's my job .",User Interface,87,252661,253981

17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,102,283861,284221
17,Um .,Project Manager,103,284421,284661
17,Okay .,Project Manager,103,284861,285221
17,{gap},Marketing,104,285421,285721
17,"{vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,105,285921,290241
17,"So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer .",Project Manager,106,290441,293141
17,Okay .,Project Manager,106,293341,293701
17,So we can move to the next slide .,Industrial Designer,107,293901,295941
17,"As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .",Industrial Designer,107,296141,302921
17,"So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the",Industrial Designer,107,303121,309961
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,108,310161,310641
17,"how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,109,310841,317381
17,"So , this one is leather bu based",Industrial Designer,109,317581,319561
17,Mm .,Marketing,110,319761,320001
17,"but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_",Industrial Designer,111,320201,329861
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,112,330061,330781
17,{vocalsound},Marketing,113,330981,331701
17,"so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,114,331901,342041
17,True .,Marketing,115,342241,342601
17,So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?,Project Manager,116,342801,346221
17,"I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,117,346421,349481
17,Okay .,Marketing,118,349681,350041
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,119,350241,350601
17,Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?,Project Manager,119,350801,354101
17,"Twelve , nearly thirteen ,",Project Manager,119,354301,355861
17,What the cost is ?,Marketing,120,356061,357141
17,yeah .,Project Manager,121,357341,357701
17,The cost {disfmarker},Project Manager,121,357901,359161
17,"Twelve , twelve a half .",Marketing,122,359361,360801
17,"Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see .",Industrial Designer,123,361001,368981
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,123,369181,369541
17,"You can move to the next slide , so .",Industrial Designer,123,369741,371961
17,"So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here",Industrial Designer,123,372161,384401
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,124,384601,385081
17,and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .,Industrial Designer,125,385281,387801
17,That might just {disfmarker} So .,Marketing,126,388001,389981
17,You can go to the next slide .,Industrial Designer,127,390181,391981
17,Okay .,Project Manager,128,392181,392541
17,"I have some kind of pictures you know , here .",Industrial Designer,129,392741,395501
17,"You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff",Industrial Designer,129,395701,402721
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,130,402921,403281
17,"you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .",Industrial Designer,131,403481,409241
17,What is this ?,Project Manager,132,409441,410281
17,This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .,Industrial Designer,133,410481,416361
17,Okay .,Project Manager,134,416561,416921
17,Look .,Industrial Designer,135,417121,417481
17,But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .,Industrial Designer,135,417681,422241
17,Okay .,Project Manager,136,422441,422801
17,"So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .",Industrial Designer,137,423001,442681
17,"Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .",Industrial Designer,137,442881,448821
17,Okay .,Project Manager,138,449021,449381
17,Okay .,Marketing,139,449581,449941
17,"Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?",Industrial Designer,140,450141,453321
17,What's the average price of this technology then ?,Marketing,141,453521,456521
17,"Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so .",Industrial Designer,142,456721,463321
17,"Or at least you know , the",Industrial Designer,142,463521,465081
17,"So what , the wireless remote control ?",User Interface,143,465281,467621
17,There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ?,User Interface,143,467821,470761
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,143,470961,471681
17,"{vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can .",Industrial Designer,144,471881,474701
17,"It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so .",Industrial Designer,144,474901,485521
17,"We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire .",Industrial Designer,144,485721,490041
17,We can have both also .,Industrial Designer,144,490241,491621
17,Okay .,User Interface,145,491821,492181
17,So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .,Project Manager,146,492381,500961
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,147,501161,501881
17,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface,148,502081,503221
17,Okay .,User Interface,148,503421,503781
17,"{vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu",Project Manager,149,503981,510281
17,But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker},Marketing,150,510481,517561
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,151,517761,518481
17,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,152,518681,519821
17,{vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .,User Interface,153,520021,523081
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,154,523281,524241
17,"I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,",Marketing,155,524441,528341
17,"Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,",Industrial Designer,156,528541,531601
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,157,531801,532521
17,but in a sense {disfmarker},Marketing,158,532721,534341
17,sometime I want to have wire because you know .,Industrial Designer,159,534541,537361
17,"Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?",Project Manager,160,537561,546741
17,{gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,161,546941,548021
17,{vocalsound} I'm just asking you .,Project Manager,162,548221,550261
17,Do you think it will be cheaper ?,Project Manager,162,550461,552441
17,"Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .",Industrial Designer,163,552641,556601

17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,165,557721,559221
17,{vocalsound} Could you answer please ?,Project Manager,166,559421,561701
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,166,561901,562621
17,Okay .,User Interface,167,562821,563181
17,"Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,168,563381,571121
17,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,169,571321,572461
17,"{vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .",Industrial Designer,170,572661,579321
17,"Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .",Project Manager,171,579521,584261
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,172,584461,584941
17,The wire ?,Marketing,173,585141,585741
17,As it's {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,174,585941,587561
17,Yeah .,Marketing,175,587761,588121
17,True .,Marketing,175,588321,588681
17,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,176,588881,589661
17,I think it's more your problem .,Project Manager,177,589861,591781
17,Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .,Project Manager,177,591981,598821
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,178,599021,599501
17,Uh that's my job .,Marketing,179,599701,600781
17,That's the {disfmarker},Marketing,179,600981,602361
17,"{vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .",Project Manager,180,602561,604781
17,Now the {disfmarker},Marketing,181,604981,606181
17,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,182,606381,607281
17,"Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know .",Industrial Designer,183,607481,619841
17,"If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .",Industrial Designer,183,620041,631861
17,{vocalsound} So,Project Manager,184,632061,632961
17,Okay .,User Interface,185,633161,633521
17,just think of um the usability .,Project Manager,186,633721,635641
17,Design a wireless remote control .,User Interface,187,635841,637881
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,187,638081,638801
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,188,639001,639361
17,Just think of the problem .,Project Manager,188,639561,641181
17,If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?,Project Manager,188,641381,645041
17,Yeah .,User Interface,189,645241,645601
17,Yeah .,Marketing,190,645801,646161
17,"I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,",Project Manager,191,646361,652601
17,"Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ?",Marketing,192,652801,655561
17,True .,Marketing,192,655761,656121
17,yeah .,Project Manager,193,656321,656681
17,This you will see in my presentation then .,Marketing,194,656881,659461
17,"{vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .",Project Manager,195,659661,663321
17,Yeah .,Marketing,196,663521,663881
17,Okay {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,197,664081,665221
17,Which is participant four .,Marketing,198,665421,667041
17,"So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh .",Marketing,198,667241,673961
17,"We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .",Marketing,198,674161,677281
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,199,677481,678201
17,Sorry for the functional recurrence .,Marketing,200,678401,680621
17,"So that's the standard method for marketing , okay .",Marketing,200,680821,683941
17,"We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .",Marketing,200,684141,695961
17,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,201,696161,696641
17,Okay .,Marketing,202,696841,697201
17,So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered .,Marketing,202,697401,701961
17,"Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}",Marketing,202,702161,709181
17,"You mean the loo the look , the outside ?",Project Manager,203,709381,711841
17,"The look , how it look like .",Industrial Designer,204,712041,713781
17,"Yeah , the the look is is bad for them",Marketing,205,713981,716261
17,Okay .,Project Manager,206,716461,716821
17,"so uh it's your job , David , maybe .",Marketing,207,717021,719241
17,Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .,Marketing,207,719441,725921
17,"So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .",Marketing,207,726121,732001
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,208,732201,732561
17,"So it's it's interesting information , I think .",Marketing,209,732761,735641
17,"And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on .",Marketing,209,735841,747061
17,So we should change this as well .,Marketing,209,747261,749301
17,"And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well .",Marketing,209,749501,757361
17,"And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .",Marketing,209,757561,762841
17,And uh this is one of the main point for me .,Marketing,209,763041,765741
17,But I'll come back to it later .,Marketing,209,765941,767861
17,'Kay .,Marketing,209,768061,768421
17,Could you go next slide ?,Marketing,209,768621,770121
17,"Uh , so as you said uh ,",Marketing,209,770321,771761
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,210,771961,772441
17,remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .,Marketing,211,772641,775881
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,212,776081,776801
17,"So this is from the experiments we've done ,",Marketing,213,777001,779641
17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager,214,779841,781341
17,"so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .",Marketing,215,781541,786581
17,Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .,Marketing,215,786781,793021
17,And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .,Marketing,215,793221,798861
17,{vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ?,Project Manager,216,799061,800801
17,"R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .",Marketing,217,801001,808321
17,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,218,808521,809661
17,Ah um okay .,Project Manager,219,809861,810581
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,219,810781,811501
17,Okay ?,Marketing,220,811701,812061
17,"So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count .",Marketing,220,812261,818321
17,So last slide .,Marketing,220,818521,819421
17,Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .,Marketing,220,819621,824841
17,"If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .",Marketing,220,825041,830081
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer,221,830281,830641
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,222,830841,831321
17,"And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,",Marketing,223,831521,838181
17,Functions .,User Interface,224,838381,839041
17,this would definitely be a good way of selling more .,Marketing,225,839241,842421
17,Okay .,Marketing,225,842621,842981
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer,226,843181,843541
17,So {disfmarker},Marketing,227,843741,844641
17,Mm okay .,Project Manager,228,844841,845381
17,"And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?",Project Manager,228,845581,859021
17,Yeah .,User Interface,229,859221,859581
17,Sure ?,Project Manager,230,859781,860141
17,Yeah ?,Project Manager,230,860341,860701
17,"Yeah , I think possible .",User Interface,231,860901,862401
17,Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .,User Interface,231,862601,867221
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,232,867421,867781
17,So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .,User Interface,233,867981,871161
17,"Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?",Project Manager,234,871361,874241
17,But I'm not sure {disfmarker},User Interface,235,874441,876181
17,Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .,Project Manager,236,876381,882681
17,"Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the",Marketing,237,882881,885821
17,The manuals .,Industrial Designer,238,886021,886801
17,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,239,887001,887361
17,manual .,Marketing,240,887561,888041
17,I think the {disfmarker},Project Manager,241,888241,889681
17,It's {disfmarker},Marketing,242,889881,890901
17,"No you you can have a switch menu , so you can",User Interface,243,891101,893861
17,"Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .",Project Manager,244,894061,896161
17,"well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,245,896361,899301
17,Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes .,User Interface,245,899501,904781
17,"Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .",User Interface,245,904981,912541
17,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,246,912741,913521
17,"Okay ,",Project Manager,246,913721,914081
17,"Then you you put the switch button ,",User Interface,247,914281,916441
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,248,916641,917601
17,then it switch to another category of functions .,User Interface,249,917801,920741
17,Yeah .,User Interface,249,920941,921301
17,"For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .",User Interface,249,921501,929061
17,With a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,250,929261,930401
17,"So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder .",User Interface,251,930601,939301
17,So we can has less buttons .,User Interface,251,939501,941181
17,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,252,941381,942761

17,"But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .",Marketing,263,977021,981401
17,I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,264,981601,988681
17,"Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .",Project Manager,265,988881,994101

17,"So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .",Project Manager,284,1044821,1061501

18,Okay well um .,Industrial Designer,2,44881,45721
18,So our design looks something like this .,Industrial Designer,2,45921,48381
18,This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .,Industrial Designer,2,48581,53321
18,"This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu .",Industrial Designer,2,53521,61021
18,"And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .",Industrial Designer,2,61221,67341
18,"So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever .",Industrial Designer,2,67541,73541
18,And it comes {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,2,73741,75241
18,"You could change the vegetable , or fruit .",User Interface,3,75441,78021
18,"yeah , I can change the vegetable .",Industrial Designer,4,78221,80321
18,Oh is that broccoli ?,Project Manager,5,80521,81781
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,5,81981,82701
18,This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,6,82901,84941
18,Yeah .,User Interface,7,85141,85501
18,So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .,Industrial Designer,8,85701,89361
18,This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .,Industrial Designer,8,89561,93461
18,This is a mango .,Industrial Designer,8,93661,94681
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,9,94881,95601
18,"The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .",Industrial Designer,10,95801,99881
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,11,100081,100801
18,"You don't have orange , you have mango .",Industrial Designer,12,101001,103401
18,"Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,12,103601,107741
18,'S a very bright strawberry .,Project Manager,13,107941,109681
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,13,109881,110601
18,So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .,Industrial Designer,14,110801,116381
18,"And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .",Industrial Designer,14,116581,122941
18,It's been a l,User Interface,15,123141,123921
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,16,124121,124841
18,"It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big .",User Interface,17,125041,133141
18,"Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .",User Interface,17,133341,140481
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,18,140681,141161
18,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,19,141361,141901
18,"And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator .",User Interface,20,142101,151461
18,How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker},User Interface,20,151661,153821
18,Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .,Industrial Designer,21,154021,157081
18,Okay so that's just {disfmarker},User Interface,22,157281,159201
18,And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere,Industrial Designer,23,159401,162281
18,So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker},User Interface,24,162481,168901
18,Yeah we didn't design that .,Industrial Designer,25,169101,170781
18,Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .,User Interface,26,170981,174821
18,But it would be coordinating with that of course .,Industrial Designer,27,175021,178021
18,Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .,User Interface,28,178221,181821
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,29,182021,182381
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,30,182581,183061
18,"You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango .",User Interface,31,183261,186561

18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,32,187681,188401
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,33,188601,189321
18,So .,User Interface,34,189521,189761
18,Tada .,User Interface,34,189961,190321
18,Oh .,Project Manager,35,190521,190761
18,"Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet .",Project Manager,35,190961,196121
18,"Um the only one that's in there , production costs .",Project Manager,35,196321,199441
18,And if you open it up .,Project Manager,35,199641,201021
18,"Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there .",Project Manager,35,201221,205241
18,"{vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}",Project Manager,35,205441,212281
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,36,212481,213201
18,"I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button .",Project Manager,37,213401,220301
18,Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat .,Project Manager,37,220501,223741
18,"I think that's what you have there , is that right ?",Project Manager,37,223941,227061
18,For the for the plastic part would be {disfmarker},Project Manager,37,227261,230261
18,My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .,Industrial Designer,38,230461,234841
18,Oh .,Project Manager,39,235041,235281
18,Okay .,Project Manager,39,235481,235841
18,"But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means .",Industrial Designer,40,236041,243421
18,Right .,Project Manager,41,243621,244041
18,One side is curved and then the other side is curved .,Industrial Designer,42,244241,247481
18,Well {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,43,247681,249121
18,If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno .,Project Manager,43,249321,253281
18,I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .,Project Manager,43,253481,257441
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,44,257641,258361
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,45,258561,259281
18,Um so what else ?,Project Manager,46,259481,260501
18,There's plastic for that area around the button .,Project Manager,46,260701,263641
18,Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?,Project Manager,46,263841,267321
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,47,267521,268001
18,Um and lots of special colours actually .,Project Manager,48,268201,270661
18,{vocalsound} Uh scroll wheel .,Project Manager,48,270861,272661
18,Do you see anything that I've missed ?,Project Manager,48,272861,275141
18,No I think that's alright .,Industrial Designer,49,275341,276961
18,"Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .",Project Manager,50,277161,286221
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,51,286421,287141
18,And if we sold a lot of squishy things .,Project Manager,52,287341,289741
18,Mm .,User Interface,53,289941,290181
18,Boo yeah .,Project Manager,54,290381,290981

18,Did y what did you work on ?,Project Manager,54,294041,295721
18,The {disfmarker},Project Manager,54,295921,296881
18,Um evaluation criteria .,Marketing,55,297081,298521
18,Okay .,Project Manager,56,298721,299081
18,Do you wanna {disfmarker},Project Manager,56,299281,300781

18,Okay .,Project Manager,58,302681,303041
18,I think that's {disfmarker},Project Manager,58,303241,304861
18,So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ?,Marketing,59,305061,307581
18,Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .,Marketing,59,307781,317741
18,Um .,Marketing,59,317941,318181
18,Right .,Marketing,59,318381,318801
18,This doesn't {disfmarker} okay .,Marketing,59,319001,320921
18,Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .,Marketing,59,321121,332341
18,"And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down .",Marketing,59,332541,341121
18,"Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .",Marketing,59,341321,348701
18,"These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .",Marketing,59,348901,354061
18,"We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .",Marketing,59,354261,360441
18,And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .,Marketing,59,360641,370001
18,And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .,Marketing,59,370201,375241
18,I would like to show you the table we have to use .,Marketing,59,375441,378501
18,Um .,Marketing,59,378701,378941

18,Can you see this here ?,Marketing,59,380921,382301
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,60,382501,382981
18,Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ?,Marketing,61,383181,388281
18,True is one and and false is seven .,Marketing,61,388481,390641
18,"And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully .",Marketing,61,390841,394381
18,Um .,Marketing,61,394581,394821
18,I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .,Marketing,61,395021,399281
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,62,399481,400201
18,"I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .",Marketing,63,400401,403521
18,Yeah .,User Interface,64,403721,404081

18,Four point one .,Marketing,253,781721,782681
18,Does the shape {disfmarker},Project Manager,254,782881,784501
18,The shape .,Marketing,255,784701,785361

18,Four point two ?,Marketing,257,786961,787921
18,"See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the {disfmarker} is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ?",Project Manager,258,788121,795021
18,It {disfmarker} or bigger ?,Project Manager,258,795221,796841
18,I think the wheel would probably be {disfmarker} mm .,Industrial Designer,259,797041,800221
18,Because {disfmarker},Project Manager,260,800421,801621
18,What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?,User Interface,261,801821,804941

18,{vocalsound},Marketing,264,806981,807701
18,And like then it {disfmarker} you could hold it in your hand better .,User Interface,265,807901,812041
18,"I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold .",Industrial Designer,266,812241,817761
18,They're kinda smallish .,Industrial Designer,266,817961,819401
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,267,819601,819961
18,"No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get {disfmarker} that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,267,820161,831741
18,Yeah .,User Interface,268,831941,832301
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,269,832501,832861
18,The flat one .,User Interface,270,833061,833901
18,Yeah .,User Interface,270,834101,834461
18,so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .,Project Manager,271,834661,837421

18,Yeah .,User Interface,273,838541,838901

18,I didn't {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,275,846861,848541
18,But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker},User Interface,275,848741,853481
18,Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable .,Industrial Designer,276,853681,858301
18,Mm .,Industrial Designer,276,858501,858741
18,"But it's still too big I think , in your hand .",User Interface,277,858941,861761

18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,279,865861,866581
18,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,280,866781,868701
18,"Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,",User Interface,281,868901,873521
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,282,873721,874081
18,like you could probably do a strawberry still .,User Interface,283,874281,877101
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,284,877301,877661
18,I think the broccoli would be out .,User Interface,285,877861,879961

18,{vocalsound} These obscure fruits .,User Interface,301,916361,918461

18,Uh despite the {disfmarker},Marketing,303,919221,920841
18,{vocalsound} I think we needn't {disfmarker},User Interface,304,921041,923681
18,What if um the {disfmarker} it was just patterns on like {disfmarker} we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .,Project Manager,305,923881,935341
18,Huh ?,User Interface,306,935541,935841
18,You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .,Project Manager,307,936041,939461
18,Oh okay .,User Interface,308,939661,940201

18,Yeah .,User Interface,310,944741,945101
18,That could work .,User Interface,310,945301,946321
18,Yeah .,Marketing,311,946521,946881
18,{gap},Marketing,311,947081,947381
18,Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,312,947581,951901
18,Yeah .,User Interface,313,952101,952461
18,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager,314,952661,953801
18,Yeah .,User Interface,315,954001,954361
18,I dunno .,User Interface,315,954561,955101
18,But if we if we need {disfmarker},Project Manager,316,955301,957281
18,Yeah and just have the colour match or something .,Marketing,317,957481,960481
18,yeah .,Project Manager,318,960681,961041

18,{vocalsound},User Interface,319,966301,967021
18,{vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker},Project Manager,320,967221,974001
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,321,974201,974921
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,322,975121,975841
18,Yeah .,User Interface,323,976041,976401

18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,324,981681,982401
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,325,982601,983321

18,{vocalsound},Marketing,328,990281,991001

18,Yeah .,Project Manager,330,1004581,1004941
18,So like maybe that's just too big,User Interface,331,1005141,1007121
18,"Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,",Project Manager,332,1007321,1012001
18,because {disfmarker},User Interface,333,1012201,1013401
18,which is a nice kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,334,1013601,1015761
18,Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .,User Interface,335,1015961,1017941

18,{gap} I dunno .,User Interface,338,1020421,1021321
18,I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?,Project Manager,339,1021521,1025241
18,I guess {disfmarker},User Interface,340,1025441,1026641
18,'Cause like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,341,1026841,1028761

18,Dif,User Interface,347,1038781,1038961
18,We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .,Industrial Designer,348,1039161,1043181
18,"Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that .",Project Manager,349,1043381,1047821
18,You know ?,Project Manager,349,1048021,1048621
18,Yeah .,User Interface,350,1048821,1049181
18,Yeah .,User Interface,350,1049381,1049741
18,Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .,User Interface,350,1049941,1056001
18,"'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .",Project Manager,351,1056201,1060941
18,Yeah .,User Interface,352,1061141,1061501
18,And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .,Project Manager,353,1061701,1065061
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,354,1065261,1065741
18,Yeah .,Marketing,355,1065941,1066301
18,Mm .,User Interface,356,1066501,1066741
18,"And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .",Project Manager,357,1066941,1073181

18,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,361,1080321,1081221
18,We could tr I don't know .,User Interface,362,1081421,1082981
18,Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one .,Marketing,363,1083181,1087201
18,{vocalsound} .,Marketing,363,1087401,1088241
18,"Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,",Marketing,363,1088441,1090961
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,364,1091161,1091881
18,which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .,Marketing,365,1092081,1096401
18,The batteries are going in the back ?,Project Manager,366,1096601,1098821
18,That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two .,Industrial Designer,367,1099021,1102201
18,Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .,Industrial Designer,367,1102401,1106661
18,No .,Marketing,368,1106861,1107101
18,The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker},Project Manager,369,1107301,1115581
18,"No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,",Industrial Designer,370,1115781,1118541
18,no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one .,Project Manager,371,1118741,1121801

18,Yeah .,Project Manager,371,1122561,1122921
18,yeah um like on a normal remote .,Industrial Designer,372,1123121,1125101
18,Right .,Project Manager,373,1125301,1125721
18,"So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .",Industrial Designer,374,1125921,1134261
18,Okay .,Project Manager,375,1134461,1134821
18,I think everyone's under three anyway .,Marketing,376,1135021,1137361
18,Mm .,Project Manager,377,1137561,1137801
18,So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .,Marketing,378,1138001,1141901
18,Cool .,User Interface,379,1142101,1142461
18,Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .,User Interface,379,1142661,1145661

18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,388,1160921,1161641

18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,390,1167741,1168461
18,Yeah I dunno .,User Interface,391,1168661,1169501
18,"You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,",User Interface,391,1169701,1176541
18,It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .,Industrial Designer,392,1176741,1181901
18,but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .,User Interface,393,1182101,1185281
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,394,1185481,1185841

18,Yeah .,User Interface,395,1190501,1190861

18,Mm .,User Interface,395,1192341,1192581

18,Yeah .,Project Manager,397,1197901,1198261
18,Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .,Project Manager,397,1198461,1205001

18,If I hadn't been told that fruit was {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,508,1558601,1561541

18,and I had a role and I had to go to meetings .,Industrial Designer,548,1676881,1679641

18,Hm .,User Interface,553,1703841,1704081

18,Yeah .,Project Manager,555,1710481,1710841
18,It's like the {disfmarker} there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .,Industrial Designer,556,1711041,1716501
18,Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration .,Project Manager,557,1716701,1719401

18,Yeah .,Project Manager,559,1721481,1721841
