60,0,ah .,Project Manager
61,0,{vocalsound},User Interface
62,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer

73,0,{gap} Yeah . This cord's {disfmarker} {gap} Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet {vocalsound} . Uh {disfmarker} It's a pig .,Project Manager
74,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
75,0,{vocalsound},Marketing

77,0,And furry .,User Interface
78,0,"yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .",Project Manager

85,0,Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ?,User Interface
86,0,Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .,Project Manager

90,0,"two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million .",Marketing
91,0,Two million .,Industrial Designer
92,0,Four million . And it {disfmarker},Marketing
93,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
94,0,"well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .",Marketing
95,0,"Oh , yeah .",Industrial Designer
96,0,{vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh .,Marketing
97,0,"So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .",Project Manager
98,0,"Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find",Marketing
99,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
100,0,I was thinking that too .,User Interface
101,0,bec yeah {vocalsound} bec,Marketing
102,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
103,0,"I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,",User Interface
104,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
105,0,"I've always wanted that ,",User Interface
106,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
107,0,so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker},User Interface
108,0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .",Marketing
109,0,"I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
110,0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .",User Interface
111,0,Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .,Marketing
112,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
113,0,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
114,0,In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker},Marketing
115,0,Yeah .,User Interface
116,0,I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker},Marketing
117,0,I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker},User Interface
118,0,Maybe call is enough . But yeah .,Marketing
119,0,"just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}",User Interface
120,0,Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah .,Marketing
121,0,"What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base ,",Project Manager
122,0,"Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah .",User Interface
123,0,like just to have a home for it .,Project Manager
124,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
125,0,Yeah yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing
126,0,"Yeah ,",User Interface
127,0,"{vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
128,0,I mean {disfmarker},User Interface
129,0,{vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch .,Industrial Designer
130,0,Yeah .,User Interface

132,0,"Yeah , in in the couch {vocalsound} .",User Interface
133,0,{vocalsound},Marketing
134,0,{gap},Project Manager
135,0,"I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker}",User Interface
136,0,Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
137,0,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
138,0,Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls .,User Interface
139,0,"{vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive .",Marketing
140,0,Yeah .,User Interface
141,0,"But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .",Marketing
142,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
143,0,Yeah .,User Interface
144,0,Something like that .,Marketing
145,0,"Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?",Project Manager
146,0,And the other thing is {disfmarker},Marketing
147,0,Bigger .,User Interface
148,0,Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker},Marketing
149,0,"Like Hand hand held size , yeah .",Project Manager
150,0,Hand-sized .,User Interface
151,0,Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker},Marketing
152,0,"Not not huge , but {vocalsound}",Project Manager
153,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
154,0,But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .,Marketing
155,0,It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .,User Interface
156,0,"No , it can't be , uh-uh .",Marketing
157,0,No it really wouldn't be .,Industrial Designer
158,0,Huh .,Project Manager
159,0,Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound},User Interface
160,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
161,0,{vocalsound} Like spaceship .,Marketing
162,0,. Yeah {vocalsound} . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface
163,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
164,0,{vocalsound},Project Manager
165,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
166,0,That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .,User Interface
167,0,Little homing device . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um .,Project Manager
168,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
169,0,{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Uh .,User Interface
170,0,Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes .,Project Manager
171,0,Oh dear .,Marketing
172,0,"Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}",Project Manager
173,0,"I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,",User Interface
174,0,"Yeah , I agree .",Industrial Designer
175,0,'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker},User Interface
176,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
177,0,"{vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .",Industrial Designer
178,0,"Yeah , yeah yeah .",Marketing
179,0,"I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .",User Interface
180,0,"You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does .",Project Manager
181,0,That would be cool .,User Interface
182,0,Yeah .,Marketing
183,0,Yeah . I mean it just seems like {disfmarker},User Interface
184,0,"So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
185,0,yeah .,User Interface
186,0,what do you call it {disfmarker},Project Manager
187,0,Select . Uh .,Marketing
188,0,"s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s",Project Manager
189,0,"But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .",Marketing
190,0,That's something we could decide . Mm .,Project Manager
191,0,Because {disfmarker},Marketing
192,0,I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno .,User Interface
193,0,"Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,",Marketing
194,0,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
195,0,and then use the telly as a screen .,Marketing
196,0,Right .,Project Manager
197,0,But um {disfmarker},Marketing
198,0,I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker},User Interface
199,0,"But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,",Marketing
200,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
201,0,is that what you mean ?,Marketing
202,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
203,0,Right . Mm .,Marketing
204,0,"Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker}",User Interface
205,0,Yeah .,Marketing
206,0,must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .,User Interface

208,0,But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .,Marketing
209,0,"Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true .",User Interface

211,0,Yeah .,Marketing
212,0,Mm .,User Interface
213,0,"Um but it's something to think about , yeah .",Project Manager
214,0,"Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .",User Interface
215,0,I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .,Project Manager
216,0,{vocalsound},User Interface
217,0,Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker},Marketing
218,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
219,0,"Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}",Marketing
220,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
221,0,What was the word ?,Marketing

227,0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
228,0,"Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel ,",Marketing
229,0,Yeah .,Project Manager
230,0,maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .,Marketing
231,0,"Yeah . Mm , mm .",User Interface

235,0,like that's another {disfmarker},Project Manager
236,0,"Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um .",Marketing
237,0,"Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into .

238,0,Yeah I think so .,Industrial Designer
239,0,"yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ?",Project Manager

241,0,"Yeah , what does it stand for again ?",Project Manager
242,0,"That's me . Uh , User Interface design .",User Interface
243,0,User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w,Project Manager
244,0,So technical function .,User Interface
245,0,The working design is the structure .,Industrial Designer
246,0,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
247,0,What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker},User Interface

250,0,{gap},User Interface
251,0,Um .,Industrial Designer
252,0,It says on that email but it {disfmarker},Marketing
253,0,It was in the email .,Industrial Designer
254,0,It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker},User Interface
255,0,I wrote down what mine were .,Industrial Designer
256,0,It said um {disfmarker},Marketing
257,0,Yeah .,User Interface

273,0,"So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker} Yeah .",Project Manager
274,0,Okay .,Marketing
275,0,So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . I just did .,Project Manager
276,1,That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button .,User Interface
277,1,Like this one .,Industrial Designer
278,1,"But uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers .",User Interface
279,1,"It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control .

But other users who are new to this device need something like that .",Industrial Designer
280,1,Okay .,Project Manager
281,1,"They n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them",Industrial Designer
282,1,"Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well ,",Project Manager
283,1,"Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
284,1,th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
285,1,"Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device .",Industrial Designer
286,1,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager
287,1,It's it's quite easy .,Industrial Designer
288,1,"Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ?",Project Manager
289,1,"Yes , rubber ?",Industrial Designer
290,1,And the buttons ?,Project Manager
291,1,{vocalsound} Plastic or rubber .,User Interface

302,1,we'll we'll come to that later . Um,Project Manager
303,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
304,1,okay . Anything else to add or {disfmarker},Project Manager
305,1,No . {vocalsound} Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons .,Industrial Designer
306,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
307,1,{vocalsound} But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
308,1,"Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button ,",Marketing
309,1,"Yes , but it {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
310,1,'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels .,Marketing
311,1,"but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .",Industrial Designer
312,1,M uh yeah .,Project Manager
313,1,Or not ?,Industrial Designer
314,1,"M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .",Project Manager
315,1,You {disfmarker},Marketing
316,1,"Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .",Industrial Designer
317,1,And a button for disabling the voice recognition .,User Interface
318,1,"Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker}",Project Manager
319,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
320,1,Yeah .,User Interface
321,1,"but o okay , that that's not really really important .",Project Manager
322,1,"{vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype .",User Interface
323,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
324,1,The basic {disfmarker} okay . Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?,Project Manager
325,1,Yes .,Marketing
326,1,Okay .,Project Manager
327,1,Uh my name is not name,Marketing
328,1,{vocalsound} You are nameless . {vocalsound},Project Manager
329,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
330,1,but {disfmarker},Marketing
331,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
332,1,"Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . And these uh were the most important criteria .",Marketing
333,1,{vocalsound} Is it spongy ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
334,1,"It should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah ,",Marketing
335,1,{vocalsound},Project Manager
336,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
337,1,that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So {disfmarker},Marketing
338,1,"So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy . {vocalsound}",User Interface
339,1,Uh well appar,Marketing
340,1,I believe it's fancy too .,Industrial Designer
341,1,"Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet .",Marketing
342,1,No .,Project Manager
343,1,"Oh , sorry .",User Interface
344,1,So {disfmarker},Marketing
345,1,"Okay , so",Project Manager
346,1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
347,1,this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria .,Project Manager
348,1,"Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .",Marketing
349,1,"Okay , well {disfmarker}",Project Manager
350,1,So uh,Marketing
351,1,the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
352,1,that's about it .,Marketing
353,1,The production costs . The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker},Project Manager
354,1,Twenty two .,User Interface
355,1,"Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty .",Project Manager
356,1,Yikes .,User Interface
357,1,"And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that ,",Project Manager
358,1,Well it's very expensive .,Industrial Designer
359,1,because it's not that important .,Project Manager
360,1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
361,1,"Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa",User Interface
362,1,"Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .",Project Manager
363,1,yeah . The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface
364,1,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
365,1,"Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would {disfmarker}",Project Manager
366,1,And and does it {disfmarker},User Interface
367,1,"if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,",Project Manager
368,1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
369,1,because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .,Project Manager
370,1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
371,1,"Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .",Project Manager
372,1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
373,1,"So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .",Project Manager
374,1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
375,1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
376,1,"But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .",Industrial Designer
377,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
378,1,So it's c way too expensive .,Industrial Designer
379,1,"It's still too expensive , yeah . Um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
380,1,But that's that's only for the buttons .,User Interface
381,1,"I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
382,1,So the button we can use plastic .,User Interface
383,1,oh . {vocalsound},Project Manager
384,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
385,1,And uh maybe not use the special form .,Project Manager
386,1,"And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .",User Interface
387,1,But it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
388,1,"{vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .",Project Manager
389,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
390,1,But it's the board decision . Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
391,1,"Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .",Industrial Designer
392,1,"Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
393,1,So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment .,Industrial Designer
394,1,"Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic",Project Manager
395,1,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
396,1,and uh m maximise the profits,Project Manager
397,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
398,1,and um {disfmarker},Project Manager
399,1,That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
400,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
401,1,"Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,",Industrial Designer
402,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
403,1,but that's not what uh has been asked .,Industrial Designer
404,1,"I know , I know .",Project Manager
405,1,So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
406,1,"{vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .",Project Manager
407,1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
408,1,Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .,Project Manager
409,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
410,1,"Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative .",Project Manager
411,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
412,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
413,1,Or however you s pronounce that .,Project Manager
414,1,"Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound}",User Interface
415,1,"Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,",Project Manager
416,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
417,1,this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .,Project Manager
418,1,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
419,1,Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker},Project Manager
420,1,"Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Marketing
421,1,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
422,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
423,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
424,1,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager
425,1,"Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .",Industrial Designer
426,1,We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .,Project Manager
427,1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
428,1,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager
429,1,Is it fancy ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
430,1,I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
431,1,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
432,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
433,1,Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?,Marketing
434,1,"Yeah , I think so .",Project Manager
435,1,"Um the yellow rubber , I think so .",User Interface
436,1,I think so .,Industrial Designer
437,1,"{vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
438,1,{vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound},User Interface
439,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
440,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
441,1,So uh one ?,Marketing
442,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
443,1,But it's not that fancy .,Industrial Designer
444,1,"No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .",Project Manager
445,1,I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . It would be even more {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
446,1,You like tita {vocalsound},Project Manager
447,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
448,1,"oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
449,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
450,1,That's a flavour as well .,Project Manager
451,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
452,1,"It has flavour . Yes , that's right . {vocalsound} You should taste it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
453,1,{vocalsound} Right . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
454,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
455,1,"Yeah , I know ,",Project Manager
456,1,Is it uh {disfmarker},Marketing
457,1,but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker},Project Manager
458,1,"It has to do with fashion , I guess .",Industrial Designer
459,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
460,1,"It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface
461,1,So do {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
462,1,And w,Marketing
463,1,yeah .,User Interface
464,1,"yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials .",Marketing
465,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
466,1,So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy .,Marketing
467,1,It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
468,1,"Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two .",User Interface
469,1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
470,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
471,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
472,1,"It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker}",User Interface
473,1,"I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .",Industrial Designer
474,1,"Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
475,1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
476,1,"{vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two .",User Interface
477,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
478,1,"Yeah , I I agree .",Project Manager
479,1,"Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good .",Industrial Designer
480,1,"Okay , and uh was it innovative ?",Marketing
481,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
482,1,"Well ,",Project Manager
483,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
484,1,with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
485,1,But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker},User Interface
486,1,Yep .,Marketing
487,1,"No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .",Project Manager
488,1,"Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product .",Industrial Designer
489,1,Okay .,User Interface
490,1,So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .,Industrial Designer
491,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
492,1,"{vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think .",User Interface
493,1,"No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
494,1,"Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing
495,1,That would have been a thrill .,Project Manager
496,1,"yes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
497,1,So uh also a uh two ?,Marketing
498,1,I think uh it's a two .,Industrial Designer
499,1,Yep .,Project Manager
500,1,Is it easy to use ?,Marketing
501,1,I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure .,Project Manager
502,1,Yeah .,User Interface
503,1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
504,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
505,1,"Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .",User Interface
506,1,"{vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .",Industrial Designer
507,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
508,1,"That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,",Industrial Designer
509,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
510,1,and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .,Industrial Designer
511,1,I think {disfmarker} I think a three .,User Interface
512,1,So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
513,1,{vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .,User Interface
514,1,Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
515,1,"Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .",Marketing
516,1,Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .,Project Manager
517,1,Okay .,Industrial Designer
518,1,It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?,Project Manager
519,1,"Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,",Industrial Designer
520,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
521,1,because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .,Industrial Designer
522,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
523,1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
524,1,Um {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager
525,1,"After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
526,1,"Uh Roo , a three ?",Project Manager
527,1,Yep .,User Interface
528,1,Ruud ?,Project Manager
529,1,Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .,Marketing
530,1,Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
531,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
532,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
533,1,"So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .",Industrial Designer
534,1,So I could make it e easy ?,Project Manager
535,1,If you make it a four it will be three in general .,User Interface
536,1,"So that's w No , two and a half .",Industrial Designer
537,1,If he makes it a four . Not a three .,User Interface
538,1,Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
539,1,Darn . Nee .,User Interface
540,1,Yes . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
541,1,Hmm ? Huh ?,Marketing
542,1,Roo . {vocalsound},Project Manager
543,1,"A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .",User Interface
544,1,Yeah . I yeah {gap} .,Marketing
545,1,A four and a three together .,User Interface
546,1,{vocalsound} Four ?,Industrial Designer
547,1,"Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?",User Interface
548,1,"Yeah ,",Marketing
549,1,Two ?,Industrial Designer
550,1,"two , two , three {disfmarker}",Marketing
551,1,"No ,",Project Manager
552,1,And a three ?,User Interface
553,1,I haven't said anything yet .,Project Manager
554,1,Nee . I know .,User Interface
555,1,No . {vocalsound},Marketing
556,1,"Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .",Project Manager
557,1,Divided by four .,Industrial Designer
558,1,Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
559,1,But I'm filling in a three .,Project Manager
560,1,That's not even {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
561,1,Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .,Project Manager
562,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
563,1,"But that's not possible to fill in ,",Industrial Designer
564,1,"Yes , it is .",Project Manager
565,1,so we have to round it . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
566,1,{vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound},Marketing
567,1,"{vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .",Project Manager
568,1,"Yeah ,",User Interface
569,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
570,1,"we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .",User Interface
571,1,It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy .,Industrial Designer
572,1,"Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
573,1,"Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
574,1,Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
575,1,"I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
576,1,"something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .",Industrial Designer
577,1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
578,1,But even without it {disfmarker},User Interface
579,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
580,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
581,1,"Well , I uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
582,1,"So , I th",Industrial Designer
583,1,"we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .",Project Manager
584,1,Yeah .,User Interface
585,1,Um Sebastian ?,Project Manager
586,1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , me too .",Industrial Designer
587,1,Me too .,User Interface
588,1,"Yeah , I agree .",Marketing
589,1,"Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh",Project Manager
590,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
591,1,it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
592,1,"Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .",Industrial Designer
593,1,Was it one of our options ?,User Interface
594,1,"No , it's not one of our option ,",Industrial Designer
595,1,No . Uh,Marketing
596,1,"No okay , but but",Project Manager
597,1,"So , in the in {disfmarker}",User Interface
598,1,"but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
599,1,this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound},Marketing
600,1,"for the options given , it's the most spongy one .",Project Manager
601,1,"Uh yes ,",Industrial Designer
602,1,Yeah .,User Interface
603,1,"but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market .",Industrial Designer
604,1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
605,1,So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
606,1,{vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound},Project Manager
607,1,{vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .,User Interface
608,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
609,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
610,1,"Yes , but it's not good enough ,",Industrial Designer
611,1,{vocalsound} I'll give it a one .,Project Manager
612,1,so it's a two .,Industrial Designer
613,1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one .,User Interface
614,1,You take one ? What do you give it ?,Industrial Designer
615,1,"Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker}",Marketing
616,1,"Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
617,1,but {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing
618,1,Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time .,Project Manager
619,1,"Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .",Marketing
620,1,It will be a one . {vocalsound},User Interface
621,1,So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .,Marketing
622,1,"No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
623,1,{vocalsound} You are {disfmarker},Project Manager
624,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
625,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
626,1,okay .,Project Manager
627,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
628,1,The remote control offers enough features .,Project Manager
629,1,{vocalsound},User Interface
630,1,"Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?",Project Manager
631,1,"Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker}",Marketing
632,1,{vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .,Industrial Designer
633,1,"Yeah , depends .",Marketing
634,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
635,1,You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .,Industrial Designer
636,1,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager
637,1,So it's quite advanced .,Industrial Designer
638,1,What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
639,1,"Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .",User Interface
640,1,I think it has .,Project Manager
641,1,Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat,Marketing
642,1,"Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,",Project Manager
643,1,Yes .,Industrial Designer
644,1,"you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .",Project Manager
645,1,Has uh the signals sent to it .,Industrial Designer
646,1,Yeah .,User Interface
647,1,Signal .,Marketing
648,1,"So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .",Project Manager
649,1,Absolutely .,Industrial Designer
650,1,"Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .",Project Manager
651,1,"Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .",Industrial Designer
652,1,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
653,1,So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .,Industrial Designer
654,1,Yep .,Project Manager
655,1,You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
656,1,"Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .",Project Manager
657,1,I'll give a two .,User Interface
658,1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one .",Industrial Designer
659,1,"Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker}",Marketing
660,1,"Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .",Industrial Designer
661,1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
662,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
663,1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
664,1,"So high quality , low acceptance .",Project Manager
665,1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
666,1,"The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure .",Project Manager
667,1,Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
668,1,D do you agree ?,Project Manager
669,1,"Yes , I agree . I {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
670,1,Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .,Marketing
671,1,{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function . {vocalsound},Project Manager
672,1,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
673,1,{vocalsound},Marketing
674,1,But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes .,Industrial Designer
675,1,But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?,User Interface
676,1,Twenty five Euros .,Project Manager
677,1,Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .,User Interface
678,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
679,1,"But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ?",User Interface
680,1,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
681,1,So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker},User Interface
682,1,M about fifty Euros .,Industrial Designer
683,1,yeah .,User Interface
684,1,That's quite ex,Industrial Designer
685,1,"That's price , but w w",User Interface
686,1,"well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .",Industrial Designer
687,1,"No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
688,1,"Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .",Industrial Designer
689,1,"Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .",User Interface
690,1,"Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .",Project Manager
691,1,"Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .",Industrial Designer
692,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
693,1,And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition,Industrial Designer
694,1,{gap} .,Project Manager
695,1,and this one does .,Industrial Designer
696,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
697,1,So I think it's worth its price .,Industrial Designer
698,1,Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
699,1,"Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh",Marketing
700,1,That's counting .,Project Manager
701,1,"Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .",Industrial Designer
702,1,"should be about one point s seven ,",Marketing

724,1,Yeah .,Project Manager
725,1,"And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made",User Interface
726,1,"Mm . Actually , we had {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
727,1,the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker},User Interface

730,1,yeah .,User Interface
731,1,We had we had too little information actually .,Industrial Designer

734,1,Less . Yeah .,Project Manager
735,1,So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
736,1,So we could we we could be {disfmarker} we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .,Project Manager
737,1,Well {disfmarker} Yes .,Industrial Designer
738,1,The prices .,Marketing
739,1,"Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .",Industrial Designer

Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a {disfmarker} leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries",Project Manager

981,2,"Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,",Marketing
982,2,{vocalsound},User Interface
983,2,It's okay {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
984,2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
985,2,"sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .",Marketing
986,2,Yeah .,Project Manager
987,2,"{vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .",Marketing

997,2,"Um , yes , thank you .",Project Manager
998,2,That screwed in ? {gap},Industrial Designer
999,2,Okay .,Marketing
1000,2,I hate those little things,Project Manager
1001,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1002,2,especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .,Project Manager
1003,2,{vocalsound} I know .,Marketing
1004,2,"'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1005,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1006,2,"Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .",Industrial Designer
1007,2,'Kay . {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
1008,2,"Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .",Industrial Designer
1009,2,'Kay .,Project Manager
1010,2,Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .,Industrial Designer
1011,2,{vocalsound},Marketing
1012,2,"There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,",Industrial Designer
1013,2,Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?,Project Manager
1014,2,people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .,Industrial Designer
1015,2,"Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .",Project Manager
1016,2,So you wind up your remote control before you use it .,Industrial Designer
1017,2,{vocalsound},Marketing
1018,2,"How {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what kind of {disfmarker} how l long can you get out of that ,",Project Manager
1019,2,It might {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1020,2,I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or {disfmarker},Project Manager
1021,2,"You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .",Industrial Designer
1022,2,That doesn't count though does it ?,Project Manager
1023,2,Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?,Marketing
1024,2,I thought it was U_V_ like {disfmarker},Project Manager
1025,2,No .,Industrial Designer
1026,2,Artificial light ?,Marketing
1027,2,Is it ? Alright i,Industrial Designer
1028,2,"Any , any {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1029,2,Has to be solar .,Marketing
1030,2,"Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or {disfmarker} and dynamo might take more space .",User Interface
1031,2,Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .,Industrial Designer
1032,2,I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .,Project Manager
1033,2,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
1034,2,"Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights",Project Manager
1035,2,"Mm . Artificial light , no .",Marketing
1036,2,"no , but I mean not many {disfmarker} you don't want to limit your market .",Project Manager
1037,2,That's going to {disfmarker},Marketing
1038,2,"I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .",Project Manager
1039,2,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
1040,2,"I know ,",Marketing
1041,2,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1042,2,"different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .",Marketing
1043,2,Yeah,Industrial Designer
1044,2,Right .,User Interface
1045,2,and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .,Industrial Designer
1046,2,Night .,User Interface
1047,2,"Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .",Project Manager
1048,2,But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .,Industrial Designer
1049,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1050,2,The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches,Industrial Designer
1051,2,Yeah I've seen {disfmarker},Project Manager
1052,2,"and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .",Industrial Designer
1053,2,"And are these like uh {disfmarker} what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?",User Interface
1054,2,"Um yeah it's {disfmarker} it charges into um some form of {disfmarker} it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,",Industrial Designer
1055,2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1056,2,'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .,Industrial Designer
1057,2,Okay .,User Interface
1058,2,And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out {gap} .,Industrial Designer
1059,2,We c,User Interface
1060,2,"But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time",Project Manager
1061,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1062,2,"so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1063,2,Yeah and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1064,2,"I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .",Project Manager
1065,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1066,2,Yeah but then again,Industrial Designer
1067,2,Is it really gonna be enough ?,Project Manager
1068,2,"I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .",Industrial Designer
1069,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1070,2,"And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it",Industrial Designer
1071,2,So it's not {disfmarker} the draw on it isn't {disfmarker},Project Manager
1072,2,and you put it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1073,2,Hmm .,Marketing
1074,2,no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1075,2,Mm-hmm . Mm .,Marketing
1076,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1077,2,"Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?",Marketing
1078,2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
1079,2,"I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging",Marketing
1080,2,Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing,Industrial Designer
1081,2,or the two things not compatible ?,Marketing
1082,2,Like a dual kind of .,Project Manager
1083,2,"but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .",Industrial Designer
1084,2,Mm . So that affects the exterior design .,Marketing
1085,2,Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .,User Interface
1086,2,Expensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for {disfmarker},Project Manager
1087,2,"They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1088,2,It's twelve point f,User Interface
1089,2,I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?,Project Manager
1090,2,"Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the {disfmarker} It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,",Industrial Designer
1091,2,Solar .,Project Manager
1092,2,'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y,Industrial Designer
1093,2,Well they're not designed {disfmarker},Project Manager
1094,2,"the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .",Industrial Designer
1095,2,Practical-wise okay .,Project Manager
1096,2,"Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,",Industrial Designer
1097,2,You do get a bit of wear,Project Manager
1098,2,they can t,Industrial Designer
1099,2,but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?,Project Manager
1100,2,"Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .",Industrial Designer
1101,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1102,2,Mm .,Marketing
1103,2,Another question is like {disfmarker},User Interface
1104,2,Again it de,Marketing
1105,2,"sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .",User Interface
1106,2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
1107,2,"A remote control , like ,",User Interface
1108,2,W m yeah,Industrial Designer
1109,2,so we have to s look at the life also .,User Interface
1110,2,Mm .,Marketing
1111,2,"so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .",Industrial Designer
1112,2,"It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,",Marketing
1113,2,"Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .",Industrial Designer
1114,2,"i {vocalsound} it's not gonna add anything , okay .",Marketing
1115,2,"Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?",Project Manager
1116,2,Okay .,User Interface
1117,2,Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
1118,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1119,2,Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker},Marketing
1120,2,Well add it in to think about um,Project Manager
1121,2,"right , okay .",Marketing
1122,2,"because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1123,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1124,2,"we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .",Project Manager
1125,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1126,2,But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than,Project Manager
1127,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1128,2,the eternal battle for control of the controls .,Project Manager
1129,2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1130,2,"It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,",Marketing
1131,2,No .,Project Manager
1132,2,it's not a thing that people are looking for,Marketing
1133,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1134,2,So {disfmarker},User Interface
1135,2,when we threw it open to the field yeah .,Marketing
1136,2,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1137,2,But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .,Marketing
1138,2,"Okay , right .",Project Manager
1139,2,"Okay , well I'll move on .",Industrial Designer
1140,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1141,2,"Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .",Industrial Designer
1142,2,"What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1143,2,"Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,",Industrial Designer
1144,2,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Project Manager
1145,2,"if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit",Industrial Designer
1146,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1147,2,"so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,",Industrial Designer
1148,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1149,2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1150,2,"but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .",Industrial Designer
1151,2,Okay .,User Interface
1152,2,"Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing",Industrial Designer
1153,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1154,2,"and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,",Industrial Designer
1155,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1156,2,"which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,",Industrial Designer
1157,2,Mm .,Marketing
1158,2,"but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer
1159,2,Okay .,Marketing
1160,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1161,2,"I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units",Industrial Designer
1162,2,Second thing is {disfmarker},User Interface
1163,2,"Hinged , yeah .",Project Manager
1164,2,for the flip phone .,Industrial Designer
1165,2,"yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .",User Interface
1166,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1167,2,"So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .",User Interface
1168,2,Mm .,Marketing
1169,2,"So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,",User Interface
1170,2,Yeah I th,Industrial Designer
1171,2,or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker},User Interface
1172,2,"Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1173,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1174,2,"it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1175,2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1176,2,it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .,Industrial Designer
1177,2,It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .,Marketing
1178,2,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
1179,2,"I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,",Marketing
1180,2,"Rubber , yeah .",Industrial Designer
1181,2,"that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .",Marketing
1182,2,And you can peel them off yeah .,Industrial Designer
1183,2,Yeah .,User Interface
1184,2,"So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,",Project Manager
1185,2,"Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .",Marketing
1186,2,Something like {disfmarker},User Interface
1187,2,"like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .",Project Manager
1188,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1189,2,Alright .,User Interface
1190,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1191,2,Mm .,Marketing
1192,2,That could be a good idea .,User Interface
1193,2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
1194,2,Mm .,Marketing
1195,2,It could {disfmarker} it would be comfortable to hold on also .,User Interface
1196,2,Okay . Mm .,Project Manager
1197,2,T,Industrial Designer
1198,2,Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .,Marketing
1199,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1200,2,Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .,Project Manager
1201,2,Mm . Yeah .,Marketing
1202,2,Also the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1203,2,'Kay .,Project Manager
1204,2,"just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the {disfmarker} I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .",Industrial Designer
1205,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1206,2,"Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch",Industrial Designer
1207,2,"Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}",User Interface
1208,2,display . Uh what what {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1209,2,"Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}",User Interface
1210,2,Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1211,2,Uh-huh .,User Interface
1212,2,"the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,",Industrial Designer
1213,2,Okay .,User Interface
1214,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1215,2,"but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .",Industrial Designer
1216,2,Mm .,Marketing
1217,2,With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1218,2,"I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}",Marketing
1219,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1220,2,Oh it would be flat inside .,Project Manager
1221,2,"You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,",Industrial Designer
1222,2,"yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .",Marketing
1223,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1224,2,but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .,Industrial Designer
1225,2,Have I misunderstood you ?,Marketing
1226,2,"It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,",Industrial Designer
1227,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1228,2,"but there'd be touch touch buttons ,",Industrial Designer
1229,2,'Kay .,User Interface
1230,2,"so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer
1231,2,"I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .",Project Manager
1232,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1233,2,Is rubber . Mm .,Industrial Designer
1234,2,Yeah .,Marketing
1235,2,"Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1236,2,Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .,Industrial Designer
1237,2,Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
1238,2,"I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .",Marketing
1239,2,"Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out",Industrial Designer
1240,2,Like one of the palm pop thing .,Project Manager
1241,2,"but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,",Industrial Designer
1242,2,Mm .,Marketing
1243,2,"Absolutely , f for somebody who {gap} very often , if he would {disfmarker}",User Interface
1244,2,'cause I had {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1245,2,Yeah .,Marketing
1246,2,It would have to be attached .,Project Manager
1247,2,"They're easy to replace as well , cheap .",Marketing
1248,2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
1249,2,a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a {gap},User Interface
1250,2,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1251,2,"and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .",User Interface
1252,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1253,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1254,2,Mm .,Marketing
1255,2,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
1256,2,"Yeah just a thought {disfmarker} they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a {disfmarker}",Marketing
1257,2,"Okay , we'll talk about that {disfmarker} so if you finish your {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1258,2,Yeah that's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1259,2,and we'll come back to that .,Project Manager
1260,2,yeah that {disfmarker} that's the end of m my {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1261,2,"That's you , right okay .",Project Manager
1262,2,"And just one small question before like you are {gap} , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons",User Interface
1263,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1264,2,"like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .",User Interface
1265,2,"Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,",Industrial Designer
1266,2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1267,2,"I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate {disfmarker} you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,",Industrial Designer
1268,2,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
1269,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1270,2,'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .,Industrial Designer
1271,2,"I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .",Marketing
1272,2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
1273,2,"If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?",Marketing
1274,2,No .,Project Manager
1275,2,And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display {disfmarker} th uh the remote control display thing .,Marketing
1276,2,We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .,Project Manager
1277,2,Um .,Industrial Designer
1278,2,They don't look at themselves ? Just a thought .,Marketing
1279,2,"Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
1280,2,"Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}",Marketing
1281,2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1282,2,"it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .",Marketing
1283,2,"Yeah , no , no .",Project Manager
1284,2,{gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much,Marketing
1285,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1286,2,but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .,Marketing
1287,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1288,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1289,2,'Kay .,Marketing
1290,2,"I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,",Industrial Designer
1291,2,Mm .,Marketing
1292,2,"but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1293,2,Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror,Marketing
1294,2,"{vocalsound} Okay , okay .",Project Manager
1295,2,that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .,Marketing
1296,2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1297,2,"Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .",User Interface
1298,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1299,2,"So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .",User Interface
1300,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1301,2,And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .,User Interface
1302,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1303,2,"Like , some some people have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Here you see this ? This is on a {disfmarker} I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .",User Interface
1304,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1305,2,"Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top",User Interface
1306,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1307,2,and g graphic user interface,User Interface
1308,2,Sorry what does that stand for ?,Marketing
1309,2,Which means {disfmarker},Project Manager
1310,2,"basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,",User Interface
1311,2,Okay .,Marketing
1312,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1313,2,which is {disfmarker},User Interface
1314,2,If you if {disfmarker} yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .,Industrial Designer
1315,2,Like you have on a l uh {disfmarker} icons or something y you have {disfmarker} is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .,User Interface
1316,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1317,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1318,2,"So basically {gap} not point or click {gap} {disfmarker} Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .",User Interface
1319,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1320,2,"And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .",User Interface
1321,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1322,2,"So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .",User Interface
1323,2,Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?,Project Manager
1324,2,{gap},User Interface
1325,2,"'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .",Project Manager
1326,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1327,2,"No you'd hold it {disfmarker} you don't {disfmarker} if you flip it open then you'd be {disfmarker} Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah .",Marketing
1328,2,"Yeah . That's what I was just saying ,",Project Manager
1329,2,"Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li",Industrial Designer
1330,2,But {disfmarker},User Interface
1331,2,and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top,Project Manager
1332,2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1333,2,"and then be able to touch that for the {vocalsound} other controls ,",Project Manager
1334,2,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1335,2,Okay and you mean to the {disfmarker},User Interface
1336,2,"so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that ,",Project Manager
1337,2,And the lower distance .,User Interface
1338,2,on the lower side .,Project Manager
1339,2,Oh f perfect .,User Interface
1340,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1341,2,Hmm .,Marketing
1342,2,"So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the {disfmarker} for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it {disfmarker} this at a low cost , but for {disfmarker} like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .",User Interface
1343,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1344,2,"So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .",User Interface
1345,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1346,2,Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound,User Interface
1347,2,Mm .,Marketing
1348,2,and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh {disfmarker} you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also .,User Interface
1349,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1350,2,"So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . My personal preferences would be like , as already {gap} uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh",User Interface
1351,2,Mm .,Marketing
1352,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1353,2,"tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh",User Interface
1354,2,"Well , yeah we {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1355,2,"I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern",User Interface
1356,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1357,2,because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .,User Interface
1358,2,"I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ?",Project Manager
1359,2,"This is central one , the one you {disfmarker}",User Interface
1360,2,Or is that volume and channel ?,Project Manager
1361,2,"yeah volume and channel . So keep that m {disfmarker} that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . This and voice recognition .",User Interface
1362,2,"Okay . Right . Okay . Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on {disfmarker} Do we agree on the battery ?",Project Manager
1363,2,The kinetic .,User Interface
1364,2,Kinetic ?,Marketing
1365,2,Yeah .,Project Manager
1366,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1367,2,"Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1368,2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
1369,2,so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .,Project Manager
1370,2,Yeah I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1371,2,"It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a",Project Manager
1372,2,I mean if {disfmarker} Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have,Industrial Designer
1373,2,selling point .,Project Manager
1374,2,"and also if they've got it {disfmarker} if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them ,",Industrial Designer
1375,2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1376,2,"uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .",Industrial Designer
1377,2,I think the only,Project Manager
1378,2,Mm .,Marketing
1379,2,"I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,",Project Manager
1380,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1381,2,but I think pretty much we've used cheap {disfmarker} relatively cheap and simple things .,Project Manager
1382,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1383,2,Mm .,Marketing
1384,2,The L_C_D_'s not cheap .,Project Manager
1385,2,"Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one ,",Industrial Designer
1386,2,Hmm .,Marketing
1387,2,I mean they use them in calculators so .,Industrial Designer
1388,2,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
1389,2,Maybe we could start with the black and white .,User Interface
1390,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1391,2,That that way we could upgrade later {gap} .,User Interface
1392,2,And you could {disfmarker} yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
1393,2,"Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,",Marketing
1394,2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1395,2,Mm .,User Interface
1396,2,"we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?",Marketing
1397,2,Mm .,User Interface
1398,2,Well you cou um .,Industrial Designer
1399,2,Do you want like a back-up ?,Project Manager
1400,2,"No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?",Marketing
1401,2,K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch {disfmarker} a battery that goes in a watch .,Industrial Designer
1402,2,"I oh I see . Right , okay , got you .",Marketing
1403,2,"So it's a lot smaller , so it would {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
1404,2,"Got you on that okay , didn't realise .",Marketing
1405,2,"Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?",Project Manager
1406,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1407,2,Yeah .,User Interface
1408,2,"So there's not a {disfmarker} really a decision to be made there , um . The buttons {disfmarker} what did you give us as our {disfmarker} The bare-board L_C_D_ or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1409,2,"Yeah the {disfmarker} well I think were {disfmarker} we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons ,",Industrial Designer
1410,2,{gap},User Interface
1411,2,on the on the on on the top one we're gonna,Industrial Designer
1412,2,On the top one okay you've got the touch,Project Manager
1413,2,{disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer
1414,2,okay and then {disfmarker},Project Manager
1415,2,"On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .",Industrial Designer
1416,2,"{vocalsound} Okay , okay .",Project Manager
1417,2,Sorry could you repeat that last part ?,Marketing
1418,2,"Um , okay on {disfmarker} we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .",Industrial Designer
1419,2,L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . Okay .,Marketing
1420,2,And for the {disfmarker} sorry .,User Interface
1421,2,"No , it's fine .",Project Manager
1422,2,"For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah",User Interface
1423,2,"Plastic ,",Industrial Designer
1424,2,"we could use the body ,",User Interface
1425,2,For the inside .,Project Manager
1426,2,okay .,Industrial Designer
1427,2,"for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .",User Interface
1428,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1429,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1430,2,"Mm-hmm ,",Marketing
1431,2,{gap},User Interface
1432,2,"so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,",Marketing
1433,2,Plast right .,User Interface
1434,2,"{vocalsound} Oh I think so , I think so .",Project Manager
1435,2,"okay . and it is just uh {disfmarker} although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,",Marketing
1436,2,Mm no .,Industrial Designer
1437,2,No I think I {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Project Manager
1438,2,just go for the colours .,Marketing
1439,2,It's {disfmarker},User Interface
1440,2,we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway,Project Manager
1441,2,Okay .,Marketing
1442,2,"um the fact {disfmarker} the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes ,",Project Manager
1443,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1444,2,"but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1445,2,The feel .,Marketing
1446,2,yes . So we could just pick anything .,Project Manager
1447,2,"'Kay . Mm-hmm . Is that going to be {disfmarker} this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,",Marketing
1448,2,Uh I {disfmarker} it's different .,User Interface
1449,2,It's just different,Project Manager
1450,2,is that fancy {gap} ?,Marketing
1451,2,"it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses ,",Project Manager
1452,2,Mm .,Marketing
1453,2,sort of beige and black,Project Manager
1454,2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1455,2,"um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway ,",Project Manager
1456,2,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1457,2,or you want something that contrasts as {vocalsound} you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and {disfmarker},Project Manager
1458,2,Mm .,Industrial Designer
1459,2,"Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things .",Marketing
1460,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1461,2,"This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more {disfmarker}",Marketing
1462,2,"And you would just have an {disfmarker} across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little {disfmarker}",Project Manager
1463,2,"Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming {disfmarker} I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,",Marketing
1464,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1465,2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1466,2,Right .,User Interface
1467,2,And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes {vocalsound},Project Manager
1468,2,which is another beauty of it .,Marketing
1469,2,"y you know , you could just go so far with it ,",Project Manager
1470,2,You can you can just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
1471,2,{vocalsound},Marketing
1472,2,"Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .",User Interface
1473,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1474,2,"like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever ,",Project Manager
1475,2,{vocalsound},Marketing
1476,2,so I think that's quite a flexible thing .,Project Manager
1477,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1478,2,"And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case {disfmarker} casing {disfmarker} the case outside ,",User Interface
1479,2,Yes .,Project Manager
1480,2,it should be moulded {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} the design in such a way you can change it every time .,User Interface
1481,2,"Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca",Industrial Designer
1482,2,Mm .,Project Manager
1483,2,"not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .",Industrial Designer
1484,2,Okay . The rubber .,User Interface
1485,2,"Yeah . Okay we've got five minutes , {vocalsound} um , or that might've been up for a while .",Project Manager
1486,2,Fine .,User Interface
1487,2,"Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah ,",Marketing
1488,2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
1489,2,Yeah .,User Interface
1490,2,"{vocalsound} for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?",Marketing
1491,2,"Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also",User Interface
1492,2,Mm .,Marketing
1493,2,because that {disfmarker} we are not {gap} for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost .,User Interface
1494,2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
1495,2,"So , are we looking at voice {gap} ?",User Interface
1496,2,"Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,",Marketing
1497,2,Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .,User Interface
1498,2,is that right ?,Marketing
1499,2,"For l yeah , the whistle .",User Interface
1500,2,"Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah .",Industrial Designer
1501,2,So we can {disfmarker} if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .,User Interface
1502,2,And incorporating the company logo ?,Marketing
1503,2,Yep .,User Interface
1504,2,Have you {disfmarker},Project Manager
1505,2,"Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design .",User Interface
1506,2,Mm .,Marketing
1507,2,Okay .,Project Manager
1508,2,"'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product",Marketing
1509,2,"Well they do ,",Project Manager
1510,2,don't they ?,Marketing
1511,2,but I think we can {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
1512,2,Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .,Marketing
1513,2,"well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising .",Project Manager
1514,2,Yeah .,Marketing
1515,2,"Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is",Project Manager
1516,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1517,2,and that does the work for you .,Project Manager
1518,2,Okay .,Marketing
1519,2,"Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that",Project Manager
1520,2,Okay .,Marketing
1521,2,so I'm not worried about that .,Project Manager
1522,2,"Okay . Did we {disfmarker} I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?",Marketing
1523,2,Depending on how i {vocalsound},Project Manager
1524,2,"Yeah , depending on the expense of it .",Industrial Designer
1525,2,"I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so",Project Manager
1526,2,"And they've got in stock , so yeah .",Industrial Designer
1527,2,"um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards .",Project Manager
1528,2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
1529,2,Right I'm going to wrap it up there .,Project Manager
1530,2,Okay .,Industrial Designer
1531,2,{vocalsound},Marketing
1532,2,Fine .,User Interface
1533,2,I got a end meeting now message on my mo,Project Manager
1534,2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
1535,2,{vocalsound},Marketing
1536,2,yeah,Project Manager
1537,2,Did it ?,Industrial Designer
1538,2,Yeah .,User Interface
1539,2,{vocalsound} so . Um,Project Manager
1540,2,Again a questionnaire huh ?,User Interface
1541,2,"so I think we've probably got {disfmarker} it says , closing we have forty minutes",Project Manager
1542,2,You got to go through .,Marketing
1543,2,so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back .,Project Manager
1544,2,{vocalsound},User Interface
1545,2,It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took {gap} .,Project Manager
1546,2,I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now .,User Interface
1547,2,{vocalsound} Is everyone happy ? {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
1548,3,So we can start ?,Project Manager
1549,3,Yeah .,Marketing
1550,3,Suppose I have to do my presentation . {vocalsound} Eh um {vocalsound},Project Manager
1551,3,Ah okay . It's Ada Longmund ?,Industrial Designer
1552,3,"{vocalsound} So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . So the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh .",Project Manager
1553,3,{vocalsound},Marketing
1554,3,"The tool training is to try out the white board , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager

1556,3,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
1557,3,yeah ?,Industrial Designer
1558,3,{vocalsound},Marketing
1559,3,Maybe you can draw your favourite animal,Project Manager

1561,3,and make a list of its favourite characteristics .,Project Manager
1562,3,So right now ?,Marketing
1563,3,"I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .",Project Manager

1925,4,"That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .

1981,4,Yeah .,Project Manager

1984,4,"But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker}",User Interface

2042,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2043,4,"Normally you can press one , zero or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2044,4,"Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
2045,4,A ten plus or {disfmarker},Project Manager
2046,4,"Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .",User Interface
2047,4,Okay .,Project Manager
2048,4,To just keep it simple and standard uh features .,User Interface
2049,4,"Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2050,4,Uh yeah mayb,User Interface
2051,4,It gets some seconds .,Marketing
2052,4,But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .,User Interface
2053,4,Oh okay . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2054,4,"Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}",Marketing
2055,4,So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .,User Interface
2056,4,"Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2057,4,It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .,Marketing
2058,4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2059,4,"So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .",User Interface

2062,4,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2063,4,But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f,Project Manager
2064,4,It's only for television now .,Marketing
2065,4,So I I don't think so .,User Interface
2066,4,No .,Project Manager

2069,4,Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .,User Interface

2090,4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2091,4,"Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design .

2094,4,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
2095,4,Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow,Marketing

2109,4,They they're uh designed very well .,User Interface
2110,4,Yeah .,Project Manager

2123,4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2124,4,Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things,Industrial Designer

2212,4,"That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .",Industrial Designer
2213,4,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
2214,4,"But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .",Industrial Designer
2215,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2216,4,"And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .",Industrial Designer
2217,4,Changing the signal .,Marketing
2218,4,"And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting",Industrial Designer
2219,4,Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager
2220,4,and then um it's working .,Industrial Designer
2221,4,"Yeah , that's the right uh option .",Marketing
2222,4,Okay . Well uh the components .,Industrial Designer
2223,4,{vocalsound},Marketing
2224,4,"Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .",Industrial Designer
2225,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2226,4,Um that's connecting to all the components .,Industrial Designer
2227,4,{vocalsound},Project Manager
2228,4,"Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .",Industrial Designer
2229,4,"Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .",Project Manager
2230,4,"Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .",Industrial Designer
2231,4,{gap},Marketing
2232,4,But this one is producing infrared light,Industrial Designer
2233,4,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
2234,4,that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .,Industrial Designer
2235,4,"So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
2236,4,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2237,4,"Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .",Marketing
2238,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2239,4,"Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .",Industrial Designer
2240,4,"Yeah . Yeah , and {disfmarker}",Marketing
2241,4,Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .,Project Manager
2242,4,"Huh , that's a good idea .",Industrial Designer
2243,4,Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .,Marketing
2244,4,"Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .",Project Manager
2245,4,"No , y Yeah .",User Interface
2246,4,Okay .,Marketing
2247,4,And it's {disfmarker} you also know which button you p,Project Manager
2248,4,But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .,Marketing
2249,4,"Yeah , that's right . But it {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2250,4,Everywhere in the r,Marketing
2251,4,But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED .,Project Manager
2252,4,"No I don't think so , but {disfmarker} Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else .",User Interface
2253,4,"That looks different , yeah .",Project Manager
2254,4,Yeah .,User Interface
2255,4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
2256,4,"'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is {disfmarker}",User Interface
2257,4,Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?,Marketing
2258,4,"Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .",User Interface
2259,4,"Yeah , okay .",Marketing
2260,4,"Yeah , but mm like when you push it",Industrial Designer
2261,4,"{gap} Yeah , then then won't {disfmarker} Then you won't see it .",User Interface
2262,4,n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2263,4,It must be around it then .,Marketing
2264,4,Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing,Industrial Designer
2265,4,"Yeah , then {disfmarker}",Marketing
2266,4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2267,4,"Yeah . Not not not not here , but here .",Marketing
2268,4,Yeah . There . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2269,4,Maybe uh {disfmarker},Marketing
2270,4,"The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?",Project Manager
2271,4,"{gap} Yeah , we're thinking about it .",User Interface
2272,4,If you push {disfmarker},Project Manager
2273,4,"Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh",User Interface
2274,4,It lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea .,Project Manager
2275,4,everything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ?,User Interface
2276,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2277,4,It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .,Project Manager
2278,4,"Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's {disfmarker}",User Interface
2279,4,Okay .,Marketing
2280,4,It's f Yeah .,Project Manager
2281,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2282,4,Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .,Project Manager
2283,4,"Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote .",User Interface
2284,4,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
2285,4,It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .,Project Manager
2286,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2287,4,"No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use {disfmarker}",User Interface
2288,4,"Yeah ,",Marketing
2289,4,"Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .",Project Manager
2290,4,I uh {disfmarker},Marketing

2292,4,Everything agre,Project Manager
2293,4,to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2294,4,"Everyone agrees with that , or {disfmarker} Okay .",Project Manager
2295,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2296,4,Yeah .,Marketing
2297,4,Yep .,User Interface
2298,4,"Maybe what Paul said , uh under the {disfmarker} on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .",Marketing
2299,4,"Yeah , and then you {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But you have to make a sound device in it then .",Project Manager
2300,4,And also it's {disfmarker},User Interface
2301,4,"Yeah , there must be sound in it .",Marketing
2302,4,But {disfmarker},Project Manager
2303,4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
2304,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2305,4,"Okay , it shouldn't take much {disfmarker}",User Interface
2306,4,I dunno .,Marketing
2307,4,Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2308,4,"Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .",Marketing
2309,4,Uh I th,User Interface
2310,4,Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .,Industrial Designer
2311,4,"Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .",Marketing
2312,4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
2313,4,I think uh you also have uh {vocalsound} remote controls with a lot of options .,User Interface
2314,4,So {disfmarker},Marketing
2315,4,But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh {disfmarker},User Interface
2316,4,Uh . We have to give our customers some extras .,Marketing
2317,4,Yeah . I think we will save money with that .,User Interface
2318,4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
2319,4,Okay . Are you almost finished or just {disfmarker},Project Manager
2320,4,"Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .",Industrial Designer
2321,4,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
2322,4,Because I was short on time .,Industrial Designer
2323,4,No worry .,Project Manager
2324,4,But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .,Industrial Designer
2325,4,"Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more . So maybe you have to {disfmarker} Yeah ?",Project Manager
2326,4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer
2327,4,Okay .,Project Manager
2328,4,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2329,4,"So this {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um {disfmarker} Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so ,",Project Manager
2330,4,"No ,",Industrial Designer
2331,4,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
2332,4,"and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .",Industrial Designer
2333,4,No .,Marketing
2334,4,"Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2335,4,Yeah .,User Interface
2336,4,Uh .,Marketing
2337,4,We definitely should use it . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
2338,4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
2339,4,"Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting .",Project Manager
2340,4,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing
2341,4,Oh . Mm .,Industrial Designer
2342,4,"Okay , that's {disfmarker} It changes things .",User Interface
2343,4,I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well .,Project Manager
2344,4,{vocalsound},Marketing
2345,4,So does it make some decision about that ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
2346,4,Changes .,Marketing
2347,4,{vocalsound},User Interface
2348,4,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2349,4,Um {disfmarker},User Interface
2350,4,That kinda changes the whole situation .,Industrial Designer
2351,4,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
2352,4,"Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,",User Interface
2353,4,That still stays .,Project Manager
2354,4,to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .,User Interface
2355,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2356,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2357,4,That's important I think and {disfmarker},User Interface
2358,4,L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .,Marketing
2359,4,"And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it .",User Interface
2360,4,Oh .,Marketing
2361,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2362,4,So {disfmarker},User Interface
2363,4,"Mm ah {disfmarker} I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2364,4,"Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . {vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker}",Marketing
2365,4,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .",User Interface
2366,4,{vocalsound} No .,Industrial Designer
2367,4,"So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . What other features can we put in ?",User Interface
2368,4,"Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the {disfmarker} Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .",Industrial Designer
2369,4,But uh some of you had uh something to read about um {vocalsound} uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?,Marketing
2370,4,I didn't read {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2371,4,That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy . That's cool .,Marketing
2372,4,It's very fashion .,User Interface
2373,4,I didn't read any,Industrial Designer
2374,4,Twelve and you've got twelve .,Marketing
2375,4,b Yeah . Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
2376,4,Mm .,User Interface
2377,4,I I know .,Industrial Designer
2378,4,"Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .",Marketing
2379,4,Mm .,Industrial Designer
2380,4,That should be cool .,Marketing
2381,4,"Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2382,4,"If it's possible ,",Marketing
2383,4,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
2384,4,I don't think it's very expensive actually .,Project Manager
2385,4,I don't know .,Industrial Designer
2386,4,I dunno . I didn't read it .,Marketing
2387,4,Mm .,User Interface
2388,4,Why should it ?,Project Manager
2389,4,"Yeah , I think it's {disfmarker}",User Interface
2390,4,Uh if i if i,Marketing
2391,4,You only have a microphone in it .,Project Manager
2392,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2393,4,I didn't have information about that .,Marketing
2394,4,"But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2395,4,"Nah , maybe {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2396,4,"Ah that's a problem , but {disfmarker}",Marketing
2397,4,And and uh w Yeah ?,Industrial Designer
2398,4,Uh only in English . Only in English I think .,Marketing
2399,4,What {disfmarker} But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh {disfmarker} Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever,User Interface
2400,4,"Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2401,4,uh one to have in channel one ?,User Interface
2402,4,"No , that {disfmarker} Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do {vocalsound} do we do it ?",Marketing
2403,4,"Yeah ,",User Interface
2404,4,It's more if we if we do it .,Marketing
2405,4,"I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .",User Interface
2406,4,And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing,Industrial Designer
2407,4,Yeah .,Marketing
2408,4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2409,4,Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .,Project Manager
2410,4,Is {disfmarker},User Interface
2411,4,"It {disfmarker} We have short time to to put it on the market ,",Project Manager
2412,4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
2413,4,so that {disfmarker} We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .,Project Manager
2414,4,Mm {disfmarker} Yeah well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
2415,4,Okay .,Marketing
2416,4,"Yeah , I think so . {gap}",Industrial Designer
2417,4,"We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . {gap}",Project Manager
2418,4,"Yeah , and uh and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing
2419,4,It's {disfmarker},User Interface
2420,4,In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .,Marketing
2421,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2422,4,I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .,User Interface
2423,4,And and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2424,4,Yeah . I think so .,Project Manager
2425,4,"Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
2426,4,"Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .",Marketing
2427,4,"the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
2428,4,"Yeah ,",Marketing
2429,4,"Yeah . Well yeah ,",User Interface
2430,4,it's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing
2431,4,"that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one ,",User Interface
2432,4,"But {disfmarker} Hmm yeah , T_V_ one .",Industrial Designer
2433,4,but {disfmarker},User Interface
2434,4,"Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .",Marketing
2435,4,"Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .",User Interface
2436,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2437,4,So,Project Manager
2438,4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
2439,4,we have to make some decisions . So,Project Manager
2440,4,"Okay , no speech recognition .",Marketing
2441,4,"you can see on the uh {disfmarker} So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2442,4,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface
2443,4,"If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?",Project Manager
2444,4,"Yeah , that's good .",Industrial Designer
2445,4,"Okay , we just take that one .",Project Manager
2446,4,Yep .,User Interface
2447,4,"And what else , we have {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2448,4,Also the one in the dark . So uh {disfmarker} It lights up when it's dark ?,User Interface
2449,4,"Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .",Project Manager
2450,4,I didn't {disfmarker},User Interface
2451,4,"If you push something , it it all lights up .",Project Manager
2452,4,Okay .,User Interface
2453,4,"Yeah . Yeah yeah ,",Marketing
2454,4,"Yeah , but um {disfmarker}",User Interface
2455,4,it it mustn't work all the time .,Marketing
2456,4,"Yes , that's what I mean .",User Interface
2457,4,It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .,Marketing
2458,4,Or you can switch it on or something .,Project Manager
2459,4,So if you {disfmarker},Marketing
2460,4,Or maybe when you {disfmarker},User Interface
2461,4,"No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .",Marketing
2462,4,yeah . It lights up all .,User Interface
2463,4,"Yeah , that's right . You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .",Project Manager
2464,4,"Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .",User Interface
2465,4,"And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , {gap} if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .",Project Manager
2466,4,"Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .",User Interface
2467,4,"Mm , maybe it's a good idea .",Industrial Designer
2468,4,"Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .",User Interface
2469,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2470,4,Like uh phones .,User Interface
2471,4,Oh yeah .,Marketing
2472,4,"Different colours . Okay ,",Project Manager
2473,4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
2474,4,so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ?,Project Manager
2475,4,"A see-through . Mm , that's cool .",Marketing
2476,4,Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .,User Interface
2477,4,"Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,",Project Manager
2478,4,It's the standard {disfmarker},User Interface
2479,4,and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .,Project Manager
2480,4,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,",User Interface
2481,4,But you have {disfmarker} You had a lot of different buttons .,Marketing
2482,4,we but we don't {disfmarker} We don't really have any complicated buttons .,User Interface
2483,4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
2484,4,"Yeah , maybe you have you have to {disfmarker} Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .",Project Manager
2485,4,"Yeah okay , but {disfmarker} Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little {disfmarker}",User Interface
2486,4,O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .,Project Manager
2487,4,"No , I don't need don't need {disfmarker} Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .",User Interface
2488,4,"Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .",Industrial Designer
2489,4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
2490,4,I use teletext as well .,User Interface
2491,4,So uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2492,4,"No , I use te teletext every day , I think .",Marketing
2493,4,Hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer
2494,4,"Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .",Project Manager
2495,4,"Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,",User Interface
2496,4,Mm .,Marketing
2497,4,I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .,User Interface
2498,4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2499,4,Yeah .,Project Manager
2500,4,'Cause {gap} simple buttons .,User Interface
2501,4,Okay .,Project Manager

2540,5,"{vocalsound} Well , that's where the thinking goes on . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
2541,5,"Oh , it's that Roo again , always late .",Project Manager
2542,5,{vocalsound} Bongiorno .,User Interface
2543,5,Bongiorno .,Project Manager
2544,5,I think you should punish him .,Industrial Designer
2545,5,Hmm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
2546,5,You're the P_M_ . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2547,5,{vocalsound} Punish . {vocalsound},User Interface
2548,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2549,5,I see some interesting {disfmarker},Project Manager
2550,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2551,5,okay .,Project Manager
2552,5,You wish . {vocalsound},User Interface
2553,5,"Possibilities , yeah ? {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
2554,5,"{vocalsound} People , welcome back .",Project Manager
2555,5,Welcome . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
2556,5,The third meeting . {vocalsound},Project Manager
2557,5,Oop .,Marketing
2558,5,"Um I have some points I would like to {disfmarker} uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um {vocalsound} first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,",Project Manager
2559,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2560,5,"so I could {disfmarker} uh can uh um use that in the in the report . {vocalsound} Um the second thing , um {vocalsound} I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange .",Project Manager
2561,5,{vocalsound},User Interface
2562,5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
2563,5,"Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think .",Project Manager
2564,5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2565,5,Um {vocalsound} the agenda for now {disfmarker} uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?,Project Manager
2566,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2567,5,No .,User Interface
2568,5,Not at all .,Industrial Designer
2569,5,Okay . Um,Project Manager
2570,5,No .,Marketing
2571,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2572,5,"we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um {vocalsound} I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .",Project Manager
2573,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2574,5,"Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .",Project Manager
2575,5,'Kay . Hmm ?,Marketing
2576,5,Alright .,User Interface
2577,5,Oh .,Marketing
2578,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2579,5,{gap} .,Marketing
2580,5,"Just press the okay button , it works .",Industrial Designer
2581,5,"Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} Okay .",Marketing
2582,5,Um yeah .,Project Manager
2583,5,Yeah . Yeah . My method ? {vocalsound},Marketing
2584,5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
2585,5,{vocalsound} How surprising . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2586,5,"Well , findings . Uh {disfmarker} Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,",Marketing
2587,5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
2588,5,and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .,Marketing
2589,5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
2590,5,{vocalsound},User Interface
2591,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2592,5,Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes {gap} uh m material . But we {disfmarker} since we are concentrating on uh the younger group {disfmarker},Marketing
2593,5,Uh w wait a sec wait a se,Project Manager
2594,5,Oh wait uh wait up .,Industrial Designer
2595,5,uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes,Project Manager
2596,5,'Kay .,Marketing
2597,5,Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah {gap} okay . The feel of {gap} to be spongy {disfmarker},Project Manager
2598,5,Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?,Industrial Designer
2599,5,"Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .",Marketing
2600,5,Not something dull .,Industrial Designer
2601,5,"But they like dark colours ,",User Interface
2602,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2603,5,you said in the p,User Interface
2604,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2605,5,"No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .",Marketing
2606,5,Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .,User Interface
2607,5,But {disfmarker},Marketing
2608,5,I had {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface
2609,5,But can you can you go back to that slide ? The {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer
2610,5,Which one ?,Marketing
2611,5,"just one slide back ,",Industrial Designer
2612,5,This ?,Marketing
2613,5,"no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .",Industrial Designer
2614,5,Yes .,Marketing
2615,5,"Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
2616,5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
2617,5,"{vocalsound} Uh well , it might .",Marketing
2618,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2619,5,But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But {disfmarker} Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .,Marketing
2620,5,"Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it {disfmarker} maybe it rubber or or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2621,5,"Yeah , exactly .",Marketing
2622,5,yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
2623,5,"Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,",Marketing
2624,5,Or we could make {disfmarker} oh .,User Interface
2625,5,"but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So {disfmarker}",Marketing
2626,5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
2627,5,"Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .",Marketing
2628,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2629,5,So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .,Marketing
2630,5,"Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager
2631,5,It's quite interesting . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2632,5,"You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .",Project Manager
2633,5,"Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh {vocalsound} telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .",User Interface
2634,5,Yes . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2635,5,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
2636,5,It's the it's the rubber uh cover .,User Interface
2637,5,"Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .",Project Manager
2638,5,And it's uh colourful .,User Interface
2639,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2640,5,"It looks likes a banana . {vocalsound} We have the fruit , we have the colours . {vocalsound} We have the simple design .",User Interface
2641,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2642,5,Do you know the phone ?,Project Manager
2643,5,"I don't know the phone ,",Industrial Designer
2644,5,"It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,",Project Manager
2645,5,but I can imagine it .,Industrial Designer
2646,5,"I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,",Project Manager
2647,5,Um thirty five .,User Interface
2648,5,"Oh , that one , yes .",Industrial Designer
2649,5,the very {disfmarker},Project Manager
2650,5,And the b the light blue and {vocalsound} it's also in yellow .,User Interface
2651,5,"Now I kn uh {disfmarker} oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .",Industrial Designer
2652,5,"You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th",Project Manager
2653,5,"I've seen it ,",Marketing
2654,5,Okay . Okay . Um uh,Project Manager
2655,5,but {disfmarker},Marketing
2656,5,okay . Do you have {gap} {disfmarker} uh thit {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker},Project Manager
2657,5,'Kay . Uh that's about it .,Marketing
2658,5,"Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the {disfmarker} our target group .",Project Manager
2659,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2660,5,Yes .,Marketing
2661,5,And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .,Project Manager
2662,5,Uh soft material .,Marketing
2663,5,Okay .,Project Manager
2664,5,"So {disfmarker} So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?",Industrial Designer
2665,5,Uh the fancy look and feel .,Marketing
2666,5,Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .,Industrial Designer
2667,5,Yes . Apparently .,Marketing
2668,5,"Okay , Roo ,",Project Manager
2669,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2670,5,could you do your presentation ?,Project Manager
2671,5,"Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um {disfmarker}",User Interface
2672,5,"Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .",Project Manager
2673,5,"{vocalsound} Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .",User Interface
2674,5,Shape .,Project Manager
2675,5,So I suggest {disfmarker} I couldn't uh {disfmarker} I had a small uh mock-up uh {vocalsound} sign on the {vocalsound} on {gap} paper .,User Interface
2676,5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
2677,5,{vocalsound} But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple {vocalsound} f uh a shape on uh {disfmarker} in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .,User Interface
2678,5,"Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .",Industrial Designer
2679,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2680,5,Yeah .,Marketing
2681,5,"And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .",Project Manager
2682,5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
2683,5,"Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,",Project Manager
2684,5,Slippery .,Industrial Designer
2685,5,s because um {disfmarker},Project Manager
2686,5,"But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .",User Interface
2687,5,You have to grab it .,Industrial Designer
2688,5,"Yeah . Yeah , exactly .",Project Manager
2689,5,So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .,User Interface
2690,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2691,5,"Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,",Industrial Designer
2692,5,"Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .",Project Manager
2693,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2694,5,so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .,Industrial Designer
2695,5,"Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , {vocalsound}",Project Manager
2696,5,So m Yes .,Industrial Designer
2697,5,okay .,Project Manager
2698,5,But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .,Industrial Designer
2699,5,"Okay , good .",Project Manager
2700,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2701,5,Great . {vocalsound},User Interface
2702,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2703,5,"Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .",User Interface
2704,5,"Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,",Project Manager
2705,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2706,5,yeah .,Project Manager
2707,5,"So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .",User Interface
2708,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2709,5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2710,5,"Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2711,5,"Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,",Industrial Designer
2712,5,yeah .,Project Manager
2713,5,"because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .",Industrial Designer
2714,5,Okay .,Project Manager
2715,5,"Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .",Industrial Designer
2716,5,Yeah . Right .,User Interface
2717,5,"But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . {vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .",Industrial Designer
2718,5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
2719,5,{vocalsound},User Interface
2720,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2721,5,You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer
2722,5,{vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound},User Interface
2723,5,"Well , it would be very new to the market ,",Project Manager
2724,5,I d,Industrial Designer
2725,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2726,5,but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
2727,5,"It would be very new ,",Industrial Designer
2728,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2729,5,"but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .",Industrial Designer
2730,5,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
2731,5,{vocalsound},User Interface
2732,5,"Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well ,",Industrial Designer
2733,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2734,5,"this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're {disfmarker} you you have to um make some kind of energy {disfmarker} kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .",Industrial Designer
2735,5,Like the watch .,User Interface
2736,5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
2737,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2738,5,"{vocalsound} It have {disfmarker} it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .",Industrial Designer
2739,5,"I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .",Project Manager
2740,5,Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .,Industrial Designer
2741,5,"I mean solar is {disfmarker} of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .",Project Manager
2742,5,Mm-hmm . Indeed .,Industrial Designer
2743,5,Um hand dynamo {disfmarker},Project Manager
2744,5,"But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}",User Interface
2745,5,"Well , maybe m",Project Manager
2746,5,"if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .",User Interface
2747,5,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager
2748,5,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer
2749,5,You you walk,User Interface
2750,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2751,5,and uh {disfmarker} but uh you {disfmarker} you're sitting on a couch .,User Interface
2752,5,"But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,",Industrial Designer
2753,5,Yeah . And wha,Project Manager
2754,5,"well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .",Industrial Designer
2755,5,Okay .,Project Manager
2756,5,"So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries",Industrial Designer
2757,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2758,5,"and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .",Industrial Designer
2759,5,"Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .",Project Manager
2760,5,"Uh yes , it does .",Industrial Designer
2761,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2762,5,I'll come to that later .,Industrial Designer
2763,5,Okay .,Project Manager
2764,5,"And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . {vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um {vocalsound} uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2765,5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
2766,5,"uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2767,5,"Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .",User Interface
2768,5,{vocalsound} Yes . That is possible too . Yes .,Industrial Designer
2769,5,{gap} {disfmarker} But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels {disfmarker} I had some {disfmarker} I had some information about it too .,User Interface
2770,5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
2771,5,I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .,User Interface
2772,5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager
2773,5,I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .,User Interface
2774,5,"Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .",Industrial Designer
2775,5,"This will be the remote , right ?",Project Manager
2776,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2777,5,Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?,Project Manager
2778,5,"Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,",User Interface
2779,5,Uh it's do it's done before .,Industrial Designer
2780,5,Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker},Project Manager
2781,5,but {disfmarker},User Interface
2782,5,"Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .",Industrial Designer
2783,5,"But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for {disfmarker}",User Interface
2784,5,Volume ?,Project Manager
2785,5,"Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .",Industrial Designer
2786,5,"A volume , okay .",User Interface
2787,5,There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .,Industrial Designer
2788,5,"Well , what about mute ?",Project Manager
2789,5,About mute .,Industrial Designer
2790,5,Thi i i m I guess uh th,Project Manager
2791,5,"Well , yes .",Industrial Designer
2792,5,this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker},Project Manager
2793,5,"Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .",Industrial Designer
2794,5,And click it to muten the device .,Project Manager
2795,5,"Well , okay . It's quite goods .",Industrial Designer
2796,5,And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .,Project Manager
2797,5,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer
2798,5,So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .,Project Manager
2799,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2800,5,"Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .",Project Manager
2801,5,"Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,",Marketing
2802,5,Wheel .,User Interface
2803,5,it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .,Marketing
2804,5,Okay .,Project Manager
2805,5,"Hmm . {vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .",Industrial Designer
2806,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2807,5,"And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .",Industrial Designer
2808,5,"Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .",Project Manager
2809,5,So maybe it's not no {gap} .,Industrial Designer
2810,5,"Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .",Project Manager
2811,5,"Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .",Industrial Designer
2812,5,"Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .",Project Manager
2813,5,It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2814,5,"For you too , yeah .",Project Manager
2815,5,"Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .",User Interface
2816,5,"Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .",Industrial Designer
2817,5,So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .,User Interface
2818,5,"Yes . {gap} yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .",Industrial Designer
2819,5,Okay . Sebastian . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
2820,5,"Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .",Industrial Designer
2821,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2822,5,"There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation . {vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .",Industrial Designer
2823,5,"{vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .",User Interface
2824,5,Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2825,5,"Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function",User Interface
2826,5,okay .,Industrial Designer
2827,5,{vocalsound},Project Manager
2828,5,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
2829,5,"and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,",User Interface
2830,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2831,5,"and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
2832,5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
2833,5,It performs the action . Yeah .,Project Manager
2834,5,"Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .",User Interface
2835,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2836,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2837,5,"So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .",User Interface
2838,5,"{vocalsound} Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .",Industrial Designer
2839,5,Okay . Uh well {disfmarker} uh,Project Manager
2840,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2841,5,d did we already decide on the display ? To {disfmarker},Project Manager
2842,5,"Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .",Industrial Designer
2843,5,"Yeah . Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display .",User Interface
2844,5,No .,Project Manager
2845,5,"Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
2846,5,I I don't think either .,Industrial Designer
2847,5,"'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,",User Interface
2848,5,No . I don't think you need it .,Industrial Designer
2849,5,On screen display . Yeah .,Project Manager
2850,5,yeah .,User Interface
2851,5,Okay,Project Manager
2852,5,"Okay . Okay , well",Industrial Designer
2853,5,th,Project Manager
2854,5,"my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .",Industrial Designer
2855,5,Okay . Good .,Project Manager
2856,5,So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2857,5,Kineti okay .,Project Manager
2858,5,"The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .",Industrial Designer
2859,5,"Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,",Project Manager
2860,5,"Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,",Industrial Designer
2861,5,too {disfmarker},Project Manager
2862,5,uh well .,Industrial Designer
2863,5,yeah .,Project Manager
2864,5,"It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .",Industrial Designer
2865,5,"Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .",Project Manager
2866,5,But {disfmarker} Yes . And I think it's more robust .,Industrial Designer
2867,5,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
2868,5,It's more uh Uh it's more functional .,Industrial Designer
2869,5,But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
2870,5,"No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said .",Project Manager
2871,5,The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
2872,5,"He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .",Project Manager
2873,5,"Okay . Oh ,",User Interface
2874,5,So um {disfmarker},Project Manager
2875,5,sorry . Yeah .,User Interface
2876,5,"So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,",Industrial Designer
2877,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2878,5,and we should uh use wood or something like that .,Industrial Designer
2879,5,"No ,",Project Manager
2880,5,And I would think {disfmarker},User Interface
2881,5,And,Marketing
2882,5,r,Project Manager
2883,5,"yeah ,",Marketing
2884,5,rubber with colours .,Project Manager
2885,5,"the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood .",Marketing
2886,5,"Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .",Industrial Designer
2887,5,No the {disfmarker},Marketing
2888,5,Colourful and {disfmarker},Project Manager
2889,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2890,5,"Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .",Marketing
2891,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2892,5,"Okay , spongy materials .",Industrial Designer
2893,5,Yeah . {vocalsound},Marketing
2894,5,"Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .",Industrial Designer
2895,5,And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?,User Interface
2896,5,"So {disfmarker} Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2897,5,"Okay , but we also {disfmarker} uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker {disfmarker}",User Interface
2898,5,"Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
2899,5,"oh ,",User Interface
2900,5,"But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,",Project Manager
2901,5,evalu,User Interface
2902,5,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
2903,5,"{gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .",Industrial Designer
2904,5,I it's too dull . Yeah .,Project Manager
2905,5,I don't think c our customers will like it .,Industrial Designer
2906,5,Yeah .,Marketing
2907,5,"And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .",Industrial Designer
2908,5,Yeah . Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
2909,5,So I think this is the best of two worlds .,Industrial Designer
2910,5,"Okay , what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour",Project Manager
2911,5,Yes . It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .,Industrial Designer
2912,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2913,5,It's very unlogical .,Industrial Designer
2914,5,{vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .,User Interface
2915,5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager
2916,5,Well the there has to be some pointing at . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2917,5,It depends also on your on your {disfmarker},Project Manager
2918,5,"Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just {vocalsound} to the other wall .",User Interface
2919,5,"Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably {disfmarker} you're probably right .",Project Manager
2920,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2921,5,"But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um {disfmarker} yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .",Project Manager
2922,5,"All lights get absorbed , yeah . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
2923,5,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
2924,5,"Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .",Industrial Designer
2925,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2926,5,So {vocalsound} it has an {disfmarker} it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .,Industrial Designer
2927,5,And the regular chip .,User Interface
2928,5,I think uh it gives us the advantage of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2929,5,And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .,User Interface
2930,5,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer
2931,5,{vocalsound} I like the scroll wheels uh idea .,Project Manager
2932,5,And uh skip {disfmarker} and skip the L_C_D_ part .,Industrial Designer
2933,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
2934,5,I don't think it it's any uh value added thing .,Industrial Designer
2935,5,No . Think so too .,User Interface
2936,5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2937,5,"Well , it looks {disfmarker} uh yeah , well um",Project Manager
2938,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2939,5,"according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,",Project Manager
2940,5,Technology .,Industrial Designer
2941,5,and I mean L_C_D_ is {disfmarker},Project Manager
2942,5,Yes . It's not very flashy and new .,Industrial Designer
2943,5,"well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard",Project Manager
2944,5,Standard ?,Marketing
2945,5,"than than {disfmarker} Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem .",Project Manager
2946,5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
2947,5,"Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,",Project Manager
2948,5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
2949,5,because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .,Project Manager
2950,5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
2951,5,"But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .",User Interface
2952,5,Mm yeah .,Project Manager
2953,5,Uh I think our customers will go insane .,Industrial Designer
2954,5,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager
2955,5,{vocalsound} It's it's too much .,Industrial Designer
2956,5,"Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2957,5,"Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M",Marketing
2958,5,"No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ? {gap} Roo , do you have any other {disfmarker}",Project Manager
2959,5,Um no . Nothing more .,User Interface
2960,5,Nothing more . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
2961,5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing
2962,5,Okay . Uh the n the next phase will be um the um {disfmarker} not the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2963,5,Sebas,Project Manager
2964,5,what is the next phase {gap} f Flores ?,Industrial Designer
2965,5,"{vocalsound} Well , we we {vocalsound} need to describe uh decisions now .",Project Manager
2966,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2967,5,So um,Project Manager
2968,5,So i,Industrial Designer
2969,5,"on the energy , well , we decided .",Project Manager
2970,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2971,5,Chip .,Project Manager
2972,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2973,5,The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve .,Project Manager
2974,5,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer
2975,5,User interface um,Project Manager
2976,5,"Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay .",User Interface
2977,5,"Yes , they can work .",Industrial Designer
2978,5,"Sorry , yeah .",User Interface
2979,5,They cannot work with double-curved .,Industrial Designer
2980,5,"Oh , sorry . Yeah .",User Interface
2981,5,That's that's problem . I'll check it for you .,Industrial Designer
2982,5,"Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .",Project Manager
2983,5,Yeah .,User Interface
2984,5,"{vocalsound} Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .",Project Manager
2985,5,Yes . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
2986,5,"And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .",Project Manager
2987,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2988,5,{vocalsound},User Interface
2989,5,Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .,Project Manager
2990,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2991,5,And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . {vocalsound},Project Manager
2992,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
2993,5,{vocalsound} The project drawing is for the next {disfmarker},User Interface
2994,5,So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
2995,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
2996,5,"Yeah , it's it's uh {disfmarker} when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .",Project Manager
2997,5,"Yeah , right .",User Interface
2998,5,Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?,Industrial Designer
2999,5,Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down .,Project Manager
3000,5,I'll do .,Industrial Designer
3001,5,Great . Um {disfmarker} Uh you you need to help me . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
3002,5,Okay . W start with the casing .,Industrial Designer
3003,5,"The casing is curved , single-curved .",Project Manager
3004,5,Single-curved .,User Interface
3005,5,"Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ?",Industrial Designer
3006,5,Traditional batteries uh and solar .,Project Manager
3007,5,But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ?,User Interface
3008,5,"No ,",Project Manager
3009,5,'Cause if we have to choose {disfmarker},User Interface
3010,5,they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
3011,5,yeah ?,User Interface
3012,5,I I think they can . Yes .,Industrial Designer
3013,5,Okay .,User Interface
3014,5,"Well , uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
3015,5,Every device {disfmarker},Project Manager
3016,5,What if not ?,User Interface
3017,5,It it should be . There should be really no problem .,Industrial Designer
3018,5,Okay .,User Interface
3019,5,They can be supplementary . That's no problem .,Industrial Designer
3020,5,"Yeah . Okay , um",Project Manager
3021,5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3022,5,th,Project Manager
3023,5,So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .,Industrial Designer
3024,5,"Battery and solar , yeah .",Project Manager
3025,5,Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?,Industrial Designer
3026,5,"Yeah , with colourful rubber .",Project Manager
3027,5,Yeah .,User Interface
3028,5,"Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .",Project Manager
3029,5,"Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . {gap} uh black and yellow .",Industrial Designer
3030,5,Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .,Project Manager
3031,5,Grey and yellow .,User Interface
3032,5,"Grey yellow , okay .",Industrial Designer
3033,5,"Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .",User Interface
3034,5,"Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,",Project Manager
3035,5,Hmm .,Marketing
3036,5,but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .,Project Manager
3037,5,"Oh , I think it's uh {disfmarker} it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?",Industrial Designer
3038,5,"Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .",Project Manager
3039,5,I believe the {disfmarker} But you have already um {disfmarker} you must have a red uh on and off button . And um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface
3040,5,"Well , it it doesn't have to be red . Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image",Project Manager
3041,5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
3042,5,"or or {disfmarker} I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .",Project Manager
3043,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
3044,5,Or black and yellow .,Marketing
3045,5,"Black and yellow , yeah .",Project Manager
3046,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
3047,5,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",Industrial Designer
3048,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
3049,5,but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3050,5,"Well , there is . {vocalsound} Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,",User Interface
3051,5,"Oh , I've read .",Industrial Designer
3052,5,Yeah .,Marketing
3053,5,with {gap} and uh {disfmarker},User Interface
3054,5,"Yes . Yes ,",Industrial Designer
3055,5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} No .,User Interface
3056,5,but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .,Industrial Designer
3057,5,"Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .",Project Manager
3058,5,So {disfmarker} So I'm afraid it's not possible .,Industrial Designer
3059,5,Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
3060,5,A scroll-wheel .,User Interface
3061,5,"The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .",Project Manager
3062,5,"Voice recognition , of course .",User Interface
3063,5,"Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .",Industrial Designer
3064,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
3065,5,"And th the {disfmarker} they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .",Industrial Designer
3066,5,Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . {vocalsound},Project Manager
3067,5,{vocalsound},Marketing
3068,5,What what did you say ?,User Interface
3069,5,"Well uh you can use {disfmarker} well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .",Industrial Designer
3070,5,Yeah .,User Interface
3071,5,So it has th the spongy uh feel also .,Industrial Designer
3072,5,Yeah .,Project Manager
3073,5,"Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber .",User Interface
3074,5,"{vocalsound} I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i",Project Manager
3075,5,"Yeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .",User Interface
3076,5,{gap} .,Project Manager
3077,5,"What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .",User Interface
3078,5,Uh is that {disfmarker} uh does our our supplier say so ?,Project Manager
3079,5,"It is not uh something uh {disfmarker} it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from {disfmarker}",User Interface
3080,5,Uh didn't {disfmarker} did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?,Marketing
3081,5,"No , but but uh it {disfmarker}",User Interface
3082,5,'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .,Marketing
3083,5,Yeah . You could place a {disfmarker} um uh this this would be the button .,Project Manager
3084,5,There {disfmarker} the icons .,Marketing
3085,5,"The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place the indica th th the signals the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3086,5,"Yeah , b yeah .",User Interface
3087,5,Yes .,Industrial Designer
3088,5,"Yeah , that's possible ,",User Interface
3089,5,That's okay .,Industrial Designer
3090,5,So you don't touch the icons that much .,Marketing
3091,5,"but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .",User Interface
3092,5,"No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or {disfmarker} But it's into the rubber .",Project Manager
3093,5,"Yeah . Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .",User Interface
3094,5,"Yeah , but this is on the pla",Project Manager
3095,5,You have to draw the {disfmarker},User Interface
3096,5,"Yes , the signs .",Industrial Designer
3097,5,"yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .",Project Manager
3098,5,"Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh {disfmarker} You just move the problem .",User Interface
3099,5,What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?,Project Manager
3100,5,"Uh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .",Industrial Designer
3101,5,"Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel .",Project Manager
3102,5,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3103,5,"But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber .",Project Manager
3104,5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
3105,5,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager
3106,5,"Well , I'm I'm not so sure ,",Industrial Designer
3107,5,Y uh can you separate these uh these {disfmarker},User Interface
3108,5,"I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .",Industrial Designer
3109,5,"{vocalsound} I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?",Project Manager
3110,5,{vocalsound} I think both .,Industrial Designer
3111,5,"I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .",Project Manager
3112,5,I do . {vocalsound},User Interface
3113,5,I do .,Industrial Designer
3114,5,Or the s uh the sideways .,User Interface
3115,5,I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3116,5,Or the the back . Or the back .,User Interface
3117,5,"Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the {disfmarker} these buttons ?",Project Manager
3118,5,"I think {disfmarker} Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or {disfmarker} i you play with it .",User Interface
3119,5,"Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you ,",Project Manager
3120,5,Yeah .,User Interface
3121,5,"um because you have to make its prototype , and um {disfmarker} yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3122,5,Yeah .,User Interface
3123,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer
3124,5,"so I'm going to leave it {disfmarker} the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?",Project Manager
3125,5,Um not quite . Um what about uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ?,Industrial Designer
3126,5,Regular .,User Interface
3127,5,Okay .,Industrial Designer

3130,5,Use with {gap} .,User Interface
3131,5,"Well {disfmarker} no , I think that's about it . Yes .",Industrial Designer
3132,5,Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really {disfmarker},Project Manager
3133,5,The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all .,Industrial Designer
3134,5,"Okay , well .",Project Manager
3135,5,And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ .,Industrial Designer
3136,5,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
3137,5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3138,5,"Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished . Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3139,5,{gap} . For the finishing touch .,User Interface
3140,5,"Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write {disfmarker} wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?",Project Manager
3141,5,Okay . Okay .,Industrial Designer

3157,6,"Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?",Project Manager
3158,6,"Uh , no that's okay ,",Marketing
3159,6,"Okay , um {vocalsound}",Project Manager
3160,6,sorry .,Marketing
3161,6,"I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,",Project Manager
3162,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3163,6,"um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .",Project Manager
3164,6,Sorry .,User Interface
3165,6,"Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um {disfmarker} try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of {disfmarker} oh oh you can see it , okay {vocalsound} . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .",Project Manager
3166,6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3167,6,"Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ?",Project Manager
3168,6,"Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information ,",Marketing
3169,6,"No that's fine , that's fine . {gap}",Project Manager
3170,6,is that okay ?,Marketing
3171,6,"Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
3172,6,Unplug me .,Project Manager
3173,6,"Thanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ?",Industrial Designer
3174,6,"Um , F_N_ function F_ eight .",Project Manager
3175,6,"Oh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
3176,6,Yep .,User Interface
3177,6,"Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .",Industrial Designer
3178,6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3179,6,"'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
3180,6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3181,6,"Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .",Industrial Designer
3182,6,"Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,",Marketing
3183,6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
3184,6,Yeah sure .,Industrial Designer
3185,6,is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?,Marketing
3186,6,"Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,",Industrial Designer
3187,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3188,6,they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .,Industrial Designer
3189,6,"Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?",Marketing
3190,6,Yeah the the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3191,6,Okay .,User Interface
3192,6,They are .,Project Manager
3193,6,well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption,Industrial Designer
3194,6,Oh I see .,Marketing
3195,6,and how much you need to send the data across .,Industrial Designer
3196,6,Okay .,Marketing
3197,6,"Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .",Industrial Designer
3198,6,{gap},User Interface
3199,6,"It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,",Industrial Designer
3200,6,Mm . Mm .,Marketing
3201,6,I {disfmarker} th that was just sort of a general point there .,Industrial Designer
3202,6,Mm .,Marketing
3203,6,{vocalsound} And that's uh {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer
3204,6,"That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .",Marketing
3205,6,"Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,",Industrial Designer
3206,6,"Okay , thank you very much .",Project Manager
3207,6,so if you wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3208,6,"Um , would you like to continue on from that ?",Project Manager
3209,6,Yep .,User Interface
3210,6,Ooh .,Industrial Designer
3211,6,'Kay . It can be {disfmarker},User Interface
3212,6,"Or , maybe move the laptop over .",Project Manager
3213,6,"okay , that's okay with me . {gap} further . {gap}",User Interface
3214,6,{gap},Project Manager
3215,6,"Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?",User Interface
3216,6,F_ function .,Project Manager
3217,6,Function F_ eight yeah .,Industrial Designer
3218,6,Okay . Mm why's it in the right ?,User Interface
3219,6,"No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .",Marketing
3220,6,"Yeah , it's connecting {gap} .",User Interface
3221,6,"No , no yeah it's just {gap} .",Industrial Designer
3222,6,Meter adjusting .,Marketing
3223,6,{gap} okay .,User Interface
3224,6,"Oh , there {gap} .",Project Manager
3225,6,"Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,",User Interface
3226,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3227,6,"but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,",User Interface
3228,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3229,6,"with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that .",User Interface
3230,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3231,6,So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .,User Interface
3232,6,Mm .,Marketing
3233,6,"Uh any comments like , if you want ?",User Interface
3234,6,"'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,",Project Manager
3235,6,Okay .,User Interface
3236,6,"okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager

3254,6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3255,6,Oh . {vocalsound},Marketing
3256,6,There we go .,Industrial Designer
3257,6,Is that okay ?,Marketing
3258,6,Yeah I think you can pull it out now .,User Interface
3259,6,"Thank you ,",Marketing
3260,6,{gap},User Interface
3261,6,just pull it closer a little bit .,Marketing
3262,6,Uh you should be able to {gap} and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3263,6,"Yeah , you might .",Project Manager
3264,6,"yeah , there you go .",Industrial Designer
3265,6,"Get it right over , okay , thank you .",Marketing
3266,6,Ah . Look at that .,Project Manager
3267,6,"Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,",Marketing
3268,6,Yeah .,User Interface
3269,6,"so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,",Marketing
3270,6,'Kay .,User Interface
3271,6,"but I think I'll just keep it simple ,",Marketing
3272,6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3273,6,"if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,",Marketing
3274,6,{gap} That's fine .,User Interface
3275,6,Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager
3276,6,Okay .,Industrial Designer
3277,6,is that okay ?,Marketing
3278,6,"Right , um",Project Manager
3279,6,Huh .,Industrial Designer
3280,6,"we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,",Project Manager
3281,6,Okay .,User Interface
3282,6,"um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um {vocalsound} our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it limits the cost for us ,",Project Manager
3283,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3284,6,but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .,Project Manager
3285,6,"Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?",Marketing
3286,6,"It says for T_V_ only , so {vocalsound} looks like it's just {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3287,6,Just channel-hopping .,Marketing
3288,6,"yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but {vocalsound} I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .",Project Manager
3289,6,Would that imply video use ?,Marketing
3290,6,T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g,Industrial Designer
3291,6,I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?,Project Manager
3292,6,Yeah . If yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3293,6,"Mm-hmm , yes .",Marketing
3294,6,"and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .",Industrial Designer
3295,6,Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming .,Project Manager
3296,6,{vocalsound} Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?,User Interface
3297,6,Yes .,Marketing
3298,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3299,6,"Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,",Marketing
3300,6,Ten perc,User Interface
3301,6,Mm .,Project Manager
3302,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3303,6,"I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on",Marketing
3304,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3305,6,and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound},Marketing
3306,6,Okay .,User Interface
3307,6,Hmm .,Project Manager
3308,6,Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing,Industrial Designer
3309,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3310,6,Pens,User Interface
3311,6,and they're not that great anyway .,Industrial Designer
3312,6,"In fact I've just called up that table there ,",Marketing
3313,6,"Alright , okay .",Industrial Designer
3314,6,"we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?",Marketing
3315,6,"Alright , okay .",Industrial Designer
3316,6,"So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there ,",Marketing
3317,6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
3318,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3319,6,"and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .",Marketing
3320,6,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
3321,6,Yeah but um on on that again I just thought {disfmarker} 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is,Industrial Designer
3322,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3323,6,bu,Project Manager
3324,6,Oh yeah .,Marketing
3325,6,so I thought that could be quite a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3326,6,Right .,Marketing
3327,6,"We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing",Project Manager
3328,6,Mm .,Marketing
3329,6,"um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,",Project Manager
3330,6,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3331,6,"maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps",Project Manager
3332,6,Okay .,User Interface
3333,6,"and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,",Project Manager
3334,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3335,6,Yes . That's a super idea .,Marketing
3336,6,but that's {disfmarker} that sounds a lot cheaper to me .,Project Manager
3337,6,Hmm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3338,6,Yeah .,Marketing
3339,6,"Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .",Project Manager
3340,6,"Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty",Marketing
3341,6,Yeah .,Project Manager
3342,6,"and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,",Marketing
3343,6,Mm .,Project Manager
3344,6,"you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .",Marketing
3345,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer

3347,6,Yeah .,Project Manager

3350,6,Alright .,User Interface
3351,6,I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .,Industrial Designer
3352,6,Right .,User Interface

3358,6,Mm .,Marketing
3359,6,So {disfmarker},User Interface
3360,6,"What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons ,",Project Manager
3361,6,Yeah .,User Interface
3362,6,"um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers",Project Manager
3363,6,"'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer
3364,6,"yeah ? Um so you {disfmarker} it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the {disfmarker}",Project Manager

3374,6,Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def,Marketing
3375,6,"Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for",Project Manager
3376,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3377,6,"and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3378,6,"Mm-hmm , mm .",Marketing
3379,6,"Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big",Industrial Designer
3380,6,Were too big .,Project Manager
3381,6,because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands,Industrial Designer
3382,6,Mm .,Project Manager
3383,6,so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .,Industrial Designer
3384,6,"Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .",User Interface
3385,6,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3386,6,"So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .",User Interface
3387,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3388,6,Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control,User Interface
3389,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3390,6,"and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .",User Interface
3391,6,I think we have to design one product,Project Manager
3392,6,Hmm . Huh .,Industrial Designer
3393,6,and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh,Project Manager
3394,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3395,6,"in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .",Project Manager
3396,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3397,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3398,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3399,6,"Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .",Marketing
3400,6,"It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .",Project Manager
3401,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3402,6,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .",Marketing
3403,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3404,6,"I'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,",Marketing
3405,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3406,6,this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .,Marketing
3407,6,I {disfmarker} yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause {disfmarker} without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel,Industrial Designer
3408,6,"Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .",Marketing
3409,6,and it becomes {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3410,6,"Or a speech recognition ,",Project Manager
3411,6,"yeah . Yeah , speech recognition ,",Industrial Designer
3412,6,Yeah .,Marketing
3413,6,"which is extremely expensive ,",Project Manager
3414,6,but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3415,6,I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .,Project Manager
3416,6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
3417,6,"Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .",Marketing
3418,6,We could focus on the biggest market .,User Interface
3419,6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
3420,6,Mm .,Marketing
3421,6,If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?,User Interface
3422,6,Ge uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3423,6,"And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .",Marketing
3424,6,"We are {disfmarker} we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable ,",Project Manager
3425,6,{vocalsound},Marketing
3426,6,they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume {disfmarker} associate that with the older generations .,Project Manager
3427,6,Mm .,Marketing
3428,6,"Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,",Project Manager
3429,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3430,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3431,6,Mm-hmm {vocalsound} .,Marketing
3432,6,"but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .",Project Manager
3433,6,"Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate",Marketing
3434,6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
3435,6,"and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first {disfmarker} it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .",Marketing
3436,6,"Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ ,",Project Manager
3437,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3438,6,"we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,",Project Manager
3439,6,Video plus .,Industrial Designer
3440,6,"yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3441,6,Yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer
3442,6,"I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um",Project Manager
3443,6,Mm .,Marketing
3444,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3445,6,"because you've got your general record anyway so if you {disfmarker} there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in",Project Manager
3446,6,Just whack in the number .,Industrial Designer
3447,6,"and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,",Project Manager
3448,6,And you w {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3449,6,it's just a number .,Project Manager
3450,6,"yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,",Industrial Designer
3451,6,No .,Project Manager
3452,6,"you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,",Industrial Designer
3453,6,You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .,Project Manager
3454,6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
3455,6,"Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful {vocalsound} .",Marketing
3456,6,It is,Project Manager
3457,6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3458,6,"after um {disfmarker} if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards",Project Manager
3459,6,It's not {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3460,6,and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth,Project Manager
3461,6,"Ah , hmm .",Marketing
3462,6,"so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,",Project Manager
3463,6,Right .,Marketing
3464,6,um and it has been around for quite a long time .,Project Manager
3465,6,It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .,Industrial Designer
3466,6,No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that {disfmarker},Project Manager
3467,6,Superb . Mm .,Marketing
3468,6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
3469,6,Yes .,Marketing
3470,6,Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it {disfmarker} you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on,Industrial Designer
3471,6,Mm .,Project Manager
3472,6,Right .,Marketing
3473,6,and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .,Industrial Designer
3474,6,"Excellent , mm-hmm .",Marketing
3475,6,So that {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer
3476,6,Mm .,Marketing
3477,6,But just to have that function would be would be really good .,Industrial Designer
3478,6,Right .,Marketing
3479,6,Okay so {disfmarker},Project Manager
3480,6,"Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , {gap} to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,",Marketing
3481,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3482,6,"they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .",Marketing
3483,6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
3484,6,"Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?",Marketing
3485,6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
3486,6,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3487,6,But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um {disfmarker} the companies who uh who you deal with have actually {disfmarker} they've they've got an obligation to to help you out,Industrial Designer
3488,6,Mm . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3489,6,and also {disfmarker} I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3490,6,Right .,Marketing
3491,6,"The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?",Project Manager
3492,6,Alright . {vocalsound} Yes,Marketing
3493,6,{vocalsound},User Interface
3494,6,"{vocalsound} If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel ,",Marketing
3495,6,{gap},Industrial Designer
3496,6,"but I mean for {disfmarker} if there were any more {disfmarker} or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video ,",Marketing
3497,6,I think so .,Project Manager
3498,6,"Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
3499,6,"we're not gonna put any {disfmarker} {vocalsound} okay , just a thought .",Marketing
3500,6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
3501,6,I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .,Industrial Designer
3502,6,"Instruction manuals . But I mean they're {disfmarker} there's customer service ,",Project Manager
3503,6,Okay .,Marketing
3504,6,there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to,Project Manager
3505,6,"Yeah . Department , yeah .",Industrial Designer
3506,6,Mm-hmm . Sure .,Marketing
3507,6,"and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um .",Project Manager
3508,6,Mm .,Marketing
3509,6,Right .,User Interface
3510,6,Yeah .,Marketing
3511,6,"I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to {disfmarker} for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,",User Interface
3512,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3513,6,but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .,User Interface
3514,6,And they're {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3515,6,Not for such simple functions,Marketing
3516,6,"yeah , they should be f yeah .",Industrial Designer
3517,6,"because we're focusing on that ,",Marketing
3518,6,Mm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible,Project Manager
3519,6,yes okay .,Marketing
3520,6,Simple .,User Interface
3521,6,because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .,Project Manager
3522,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3523,6,Mm .,Marketing
3524,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3525,6,"Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .",Marketing
3526,6,"It does ,",Project Manager
3527,6,It's the uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3528,6,you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong,Project Manager
3529,6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
3530,6,"and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about .",Project Manager
3531,6,"Sure , okay .",Marketing
3532,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3533,6,"Um , what other functions ? We need {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about {disfmarker} c 'cause you've got the dilemma between {disfmarker} oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?",Project Manager
3534,6,"Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
3535,6,"Well they la they they last quite a long time ,",Project Manager
3536,6,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
3537,6,"and if you had uh {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,",Project Manager
3538,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3539,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3540,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3541,6,but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .,Project Manager
3542,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3543,6,"Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .",Project Manager
3544,6,Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3545,6,"Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay .",Project Manager
3546,6,Yeah on that as well so .,Industrial Designer
3547,6,So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?,User Interface
3548,6,S,Project Manager
3549,6,Yeah,Industrial Designer
3550,6,Yes .,Project Manager
3551,6,some sort of docking station or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3552,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3553,6,Rechargeable with a docking station .,Project Manager
3554,6,yeah .,Industrial Designer
3555,6,So the rechargeable which would be your field .,Project Manager
3556,6,"Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,",Industrial Designer
3557,6,Okay .,Project Manager
3558,6,and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .,Industrial Designer
3559,6,Right .,User Interface
3560,6,"Yes ,",Project Manager
3561,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3562,6,which it is cheaper in the long run as well .,Project Manager
3563,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3564,6,"Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either ,",Project Manager
3565,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3566,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3567,6,"because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how much you try and make it simple ,",Project Manager
3568,6,Mm .,Marketing
3569,6,um {disfmarker},Project Manager
3570,6,"And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,",Marketing
3571,6,They do .,Project Manager
3572,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3573,6,"these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely {disfmarker} an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .",Marketing
3574,6,Okay so we've got a flip-screen .,Project Manager
3575,6,Okay .,User Interface
3576,6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
3577,6,"What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate .",User Interface
3578,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3579,6,"That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,",User Interface
3580,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3581,6,"and you don't have to {disfmarker} you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .",User Interface
3582,6,"Slightly curved , curved .",Marketing
3583,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3584,6,Okay .,Project Manager
3585,6,G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't,User Interface
3586,6,Mm .,Marketing
3587,6,'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .,Project Manager
3588,6,y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your {disfmarker},User Interface
3589,6,Mm .,Marketing
3590,6,"the way you h hold of {disfmarker} it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .",User Interface
3591,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3592,6,Okay .,Project Manager
3593,6,I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .,User Interface
3594,6,"Can you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .",Project Manager
3595,6,Current .,User Interface
3596,6,"I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,",Project Manager
3597,6,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3598,6,"um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design ,",Project Manager
3599,6,{gap},Marketing
3600,6,while also making it quite different from anything else that's there .,Project Manager
3601,6,"We could look in at that but {disfmarker} Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells ,",User Interface
3602,6,I mean look at the mobile .,Marketing
3603,6,"logo could become as {disfmarker} you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .",User Interface
3604,6,Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different .,Project Manager
3605,6,"I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that sounds a really attractive idea ,",Marketing
3606,6,A sea shell ?,User Interface
3607,6,"I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of {disfmarker} yeah and that opens out into your flip-top .",Marketing
3608,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3609,6,"Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea",Marketing
3610,6,Yeah we could look in at that .,User Interface
3611,6,"and plus you can get {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know even though we're using plastic , you can still {disfmarker} I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .",Marketing
3612,6,"Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings .",Project Manager
3613,6,Mm .,Industrial Designer
3614,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3615,6,So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and {disfmarker},Project Manager
3616,6,"Yeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa",Marketing
3617,6,Yeah .,Project Manager
3618,6,and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't {disfmarker} not gonna lose it so much {vocalsound} either . It's easier to {disfmarker} bit nice to handle .,Marketing
3619,6,Mm .,Project Manager
3620,6,"Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are {disfmarker} whichever appeals the most like ,",User Interface
3621,6,Okay .,Project Manager
3622,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3623,6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
3624,6,that could be the most common design .,User Interface
3625,6,Okay .,Project Manager
3626,6,Okay .,Marketing
3627,6,"But we can like think of five , six designs .",User Interface
3628,6,"Okay . Right , I think we have to round it up , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3629,6,Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .,Marketing
3630,6,Sure .,Project Manager
3631,6,"So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video ,",Marketing
3632,6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3633,6,"our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .",Marketing
3634,6,"That was um in cutting down the number {disfmarker} that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3635,6,"Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you {disfmarker} it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and {disfmarker} Or was {disfmarker} is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just {disfmarker} that was an add-on feature ?",Marketing
3636,6,"{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .",Project Manager
3637,6,"Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?",Marketing
3638,6,"Um it could be it c It {disfmarker} yes ,",Project Manager
3639,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3640,6,"it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,",Project Manager
3641,6,Right .,Marketing
3642,6,"you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .",Project Manager
3643,6,"Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .",Marketing
3644,6,Yeah .,Project Manager
3645,6,Was there anything else there that we {disfmarker} in the new new project requirements ?,Marketing
3646,6,{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
3647,6,Yeah . {gap},User Interface
3648,6,"We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .",Project Manager
3649,6,Yeah .,User Interface
3650,6,"Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at ,",Marketing
3651,6,Yes . Yes .,Project Manager
3652,6,what preference {disfmarker} so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .,Marketing
3653,6,"And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .",Project Manager
3654,6,"For detection , right .",User Interface
3655,6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3656,6,"Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible .

I think {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3657,6,"Yep ,",User Interface
3658,6,"Yep ,",Project Manager

3677,6,"Right , okay . I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . Um and I'll be able to not answer them .",Project Manager
3678,7,"Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um {vocalsound} .",Project Manager
3679,7,{vocalsound},User Interface
3680,7,Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .,Project Manager
3681,7,{vocalsound} 'Scuse me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
3682,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3683,7,Bless you .,Marketing
3684,7,"Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , {vocalsound} under marketing we targeted our audience , and {disfmarker} Um , yeah . That was {vocalsound} generally {vocalsound} {disfmarker} how helpful that was .",Project Manager
3685,7,{vocalsound},Marketing
3686,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3687,7,"Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're {disfmarker} Right , um {disfmarker} So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what {disfmarker} where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ?",Project Manager
3688,7,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
3689,7,Yeah .,Marketing
3690,7,Okay .,Project Manager
3691,7,Yes .,Industrial Designer
3692,7,Yes .,User Interface
3693,7,Would anybody like to go first ?,Project Manager
3694,7,Sure .,Industrial Designer
3695,7,Okay .,Project Manager
3696,7,"So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .",Industrial Designer
3697,7,And why not wood ?,Project Manager
3698,7,"And ,",Industrial Designer
3699,7,And why not wood ? {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Project Manager
3700,7,"hmm ? {vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood . {vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design .",Industrial Designer
3701,7,'S good .,Project Manager
3702,7,"Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material",Marketing
3703,7,Hmm .,Project Manager
3704,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3705,7,Yeah .,User Interface
3706,7,which is quite shocking .,Marketing
3707,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3708,7,"Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the {vocalsound} is the current trend",Marketing

3710,7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
3711,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3712,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3713,7,"and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion .",Marketing
3714,7,Mm .,Project Manager
3715,7,"The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,",Marketing
3716,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3717,7,but that's just a personal opinion .,Marketing
3718,7,{vocalsound},User Interface
3719,7,I think,Marketing
3720,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3721,7,I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .,Marketing
3722,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3723,7,"{vocalsound} Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?",Marketing
3724,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3725,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3726,7,"Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .",Marketing
3727,7,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
3728,7,Thank you for your attention .,Marketing
3729,7,So .,User Interface
3730,7,"I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah .",Project Manager
3731,7,"Oh , uh , there we go . {vocalsound} Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .",User Interface
3732,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3733,7,{vocalsound},Marketing
3734,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3735,7,{vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics,User Interface
3736,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3737,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3738,7,and and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface
3739,7,"Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um {vocalsound} fabrics . {vocalsound}",Marketing
3740,7,Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound},Project Manager
3741,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3742,7,"So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .",User Interface
3743,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3744,7,"And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?",User Interface
3745,7,Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .,Project Manager
3746,7,'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel,User Interface
3747,7,You need a screen for it ?,Project Manager
3748,7,you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen .,User Interface
3749,7,"You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
3750,7,"But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?",User Interface
3751,7,"We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,",Project Manager
3752,7,Are we {disfmarker},User Interface
3753,7,that was one of th I I was {disfmarker},Project Manager
3754,7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3755,7,Okay .,User Interface
3756,7,"sorry ,",Project Manager
3757,7,{vocalsound},Marketing
3758,7,I I meant to update you on that . Um .,Project Manager
3759,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3760,7,{vocalsound} Alright . Okay .,User Interface
3761,7,"But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said .",Marketing
3762,7,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
3763,7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3764,7,That correct ?,Marketing
3765,7,So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right .,User Interface
3766,7,Graphical interface ?,Marketing
3767,7,Yeah like you're g,User Interface
3768,7,Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though .,Marketing
3769,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3770,7,"yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can {disfmarker} okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .",User Interface
3771,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3772,7,So that {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} people seems to be {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface
3773,7,"You've {disfmarker} Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3774,7,You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um {vocalsound} I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because {disfmarker} So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if {disfmarker} or or {disfmarker} then again if you just {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .,User Interface
3775,7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
3776,7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3777,7,You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or {disfmarker},User Interface
3778,7,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing
3779,7,But but imagine someone with s,Project Manager
3780,7,"My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer
3781,7,I oh yeah ?,User Interface
3782,7,But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager
3783,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3784,7,'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker},User Interface
3785,7,Yeah .,Marketing
3786,7,They have to r wheel really fast .,Industrial Designer
3787,7,but you can quickly s you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
3788,7,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
3789,7,"But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,",Industrial Designer
3790,7,Yeah .,User Interface
3791,7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
3792,7,at least on theirs .,Industrial Designer
3793,7,"Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different",User Interface
3794,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3795,7,"uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth",User Interface
3796,7,Right .,Project Manager
3797,7,"And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,",User Interface
3798,7,"Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better ,",Project Manager
3799,7,like {disfmarker},User Interface
3800,7,"because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3801,7,"I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker}",User Interface
3802,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3803,7,"but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker}",User Interface
3804,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3805,7,It's more expensive according to the design people .,Industrial Designer
3806,7,m yeah .,User Interface
3807,7,Uh . {vocalsound},Project Manager
3808,7,"Yeah , that's the only thing though .",User Interface
3809,7,"You have to get a {disfmarker} an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .",Industrial Designer
3810,7,"Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um {disfmarker}",User Interface
3811,7,Mm .,Project Manager
3812,7,"{vocalsound} You can get to {disfmarker} you know , you can {disfmarker} Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can {disfmarker} it brings up like the menu on the T_V_",User Interface
3813,7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
3814,7,Mm .,Project Manager
3815,7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
3816,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3817,7,"and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the {disfmarker}",User Interface
3818,7,Yeah .,Marketing
3819,7,"So the T_V_ is the screen , that {disfmarker} yeah",Project Manager
3820,7,"yeah , yeah .",User Interface
3821,7,So it would have all these different options of changing,Project Manager
3822,7,Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .,User Interface
3823,7,to {disfmarker},Project Manager
3824,7,Look it even has settings .,Marketing
3825,7,Okay .,Project Manager
3826,7,Hmm ?,User Interface
3827,7,On the {disfmarker},Marketing
3828,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3829,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3830,7,{vocalsound} you can just take theirs and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing
3831,7,"Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,",User Interface
3832,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3833,7,"but um {disfmarker} 'cause that just {disfmarker} it does seem like , it {disfmarker} that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but {disfmarker} I dunno , and then {disfmarker} so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .",User Interface
3834,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3835,7,So {disfmarker},User Interface
3836,7,"Um , right . What if {disfmarker} I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes ,",Project Manager
3837,7,Yeah .,User Interface
3838,7,"um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing ,",Project Manager
3839,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3840,7,or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or {disfmarker},Project Manager
3841,7,It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .,User Interface
3842,7,Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager
3843,7,Yeah . Yeah definitely .,User Interface
3844,7,okay .,Project Manager
3845,7,"Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .",User Interface
3846,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3847,7,I mean it it needs to be easy to {disfmarker},User Interface
3848,7,Yeah but should be comfortable .,Marketing
3849,7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3850,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3851,7,somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your {disfmarker},User Interface
3852,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3853,7,"I mean how do how do {disfmarker} I'm not really {disfmarker} Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So {disfmarker}",User Interface
3854,7,"Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .",Project Manager
3855,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3856,7,{vocalsound} Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So {disfmarker},User Interface
3857,7,Yeah I use it like that .,Marketing
3858,7,"W when we had the wheely remote control , we {disfmarker} it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .",Industrial Designer
3859,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3860,7,Yeah .,User Interface
3861,7,Yeah .,Marketing
3862,7,"But , were there buttons on there as well ?",Project Manager
3863,7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
3864,7,Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .,Industrial Designer
3865,7,Mm . Yeah .,Project Manager
3866,7,So we just used the top part .,Industrial Designer
3867,7,Mm yeah .,User Interface
3868,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
3869,7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker} but I mean I think it could be pretty small .",User Interface
3870,7,Uh .,Marketing
3871,7,"Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can {disfmarker}",User Interface
3872,7,"What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you {disfmarker} so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .",Project Manager
3873,7,But can't you just get {disfmarker},User Interface
3874,7,"Do {disfmarker} do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3875,7,Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3876,7,K,User Interface
3877,7,"Well you can have it on the settings ,",Marketing
3878,7,"Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
3879,7,no ?,Marketing
3880,7,"Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen .",User Interface
3881,7,Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing,Project Manager
3882,7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
3883,7,is is {disfmarker} if w I {disfmarker},Project Manager
3884,7,That keeps it,User Interface
3885,7,"if we can do this , that'd probably be {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3886,7,really {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh you wouldn't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I just don't think you would even need it .,User Interface
3887,7,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
3888,7,So {disfmarker},User Interface
3889,7,"So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this {disfmarker} how they actually programme these things , and if that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3890,7,Mean {disfmarker},User Interface
3891,7,Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?,Industrial Designer
3892,7,yeah . I mean it {disfmarker} would y would {disfmarker} that would be {disfmarker},Project Manager
3893,7,I don't know .,Industrial Designer
3894,7,"I mean you can do it ,",User Interface
3895,7,They already do it .,Marketing
3896,7,"I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .",Industrial Designer
3897,7,you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote .,User Interface
3898,7,I'm not sure .,Industrial Designer
3899,7,"It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,",User Interface
3900,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3901,7,{vocalsound},Marketing
3902,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3903,7,Well they usually are .,Industrial Designer
3904,7,which is a little {disfmarker},User Interface
3905,7,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
3906,7,"My {disfmarker} I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .",User Interface
3907,7,No .,Marketing
3908,7,Huh .,Project Manager
3909,7,But um {disfmarker},User Interface
3910,7,I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3911,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
3912,7,"So , um {disfmarker} but I mean it's {disfmarker} I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .",User Interface
3913,7,"Yeah , it {disfmarker} most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .",Industrial Designer
3914,7,"Yeah . Yeah . Well so {disfmarker} So , do we need {disfmarker} I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about {disfmarker} But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .",User Interface
3915,7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
3916,7,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
3917,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3918,7,That's what it does anyway .,User Interface
3919,7,"But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you {disfmarker} like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,",Marketing
3920,7,Yeah .,User Interface
3921,7,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
3922,7,Yeah . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3923,7,"you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like {disfmarker}",Project Manager
3924,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3925,7,and I never get it .,Marketing
3926,7,yeah .,Project Manager
3927,7,Yeah .,User Interface
3928,7,Never ever .,Marketing
3929,7,"So , but {disfmarker}",User Interface
3930,7,So {disfmarker},Marketing
3931,7,"oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?",User Interface
3932,7,Well on the telly .,Marketing
3933,7,Or on the T_V_ too .,Industrial Designer
3934,7,"On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea",User Interface
3935,7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
3936,7,"because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .",User Interface
3937,7,"Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,",Project Manager
3938,7,Mm .,Marketing
3939,7,so that fits with the {disfmarker},Project Manager

4127,7,Yeah .,User Interface

4134,7,But uh it {disfmarker},User Interface

4152,7,"Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,",Industrial Designer
4153,7,{vocalsound},Project Manager
4154,7,which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .,Industrial Designer
4155,7,"Oh , a dynamo is {disfmarker} ah , {vocalsound} it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .",Marketing

4159,7,{vocalsound},User Interface
4160,7,It's quite sweet .,Marketing
4161,7,We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .,Industrial Designer
4162,7,I think batteries sound good .,Project Manager
4163,7,It {vocalsound} it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .,Industrial Designer
4164,7,What does everyone else think ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
4165,7,{vocalsound} The dynamo would be interesting {vocalsound} .,User Interface
4166,7,"No . But dynamo {disfmarker} the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it {vocalsound} creates energy on its own .",Marketing
4167,7,What about Kryptonite ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
4168,7,Oh .,User Interface
4169,7,"Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .",Marketing
4170,7,Yeah .,Project Manager
4171,7,Don't know the cost .,Marketing
4172,7,Didn't have enough data to actually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer

4181,7,{vocalsound},Marketing
4182,7,Uh-huh .,Project Manager
4183,7,"calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .",Industrial Designer

4620,8,No .,Project Manager
4621,8,That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .,Industrial Designer
4622,8,"So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker}",User Interface
4623,8,Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .,Marketing
4624,8,"Well , I think it is .",Industrial Designer
4625,8,"Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .",Marketing
4626,8,Well y just uh f,User Interface
4627,8,"I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or",Marketing

5319,9,Yeah uh .,Industrial Designer
5320,9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5321,9,"but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .",Project Manager
5322,9,Use all the ones at the same time .,Industrial Designer
5323,9,Right .,Marketing
5324,9,"Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}",User Interface
5325,9,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
5326,9,Okay .,User Interface
5327,9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5328,9,'cause you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5329,9,"My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,",Marketing
5330,9,Mm .,Project Manager
5331,9,"I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .",Marketing
5332,9,"Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean",Project Manager
5333,9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5334,9,{disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do,Project Manager
5335,9,Mm .,Marketing
5336,9,and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .,Project Manager
5337,9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5338,9,"Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,",Marketing
5339,9,Yeah .,Project Manager
5340,9,symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .,Marketing
5341,9,So simplification of symbols you could think of .,User Interface
5342,9,"{vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .",Project Manager
5343,9,Oh yeah . Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5344,9,"'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,",Project Manager
5345,9,Mm .,Marketing
5346,9,"it's obvious what you're doing , um .",Project Manager
5347,9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5348,9,Mm .,Industrial Designer
5349,9,"Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,",Marketing
5350,9,"Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .",User Interface
5351,9,"I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,",Marketing
5352,9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5353,9,Uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface
5354,9,so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .,Marketing
5355,9,"Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .",User Interface
5356,9,"With menus , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
5357,9,"And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .",User Interface
5358,9,Yeah .,Marketing
5359,9,What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?,Project Manager
5360,9,{vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number .,User Interface
5361,9,"Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .",Project Manager
5362,9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5363,9,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?,Marketing
5364,9,Right .,User Interface
5365,9,"I don't think they tape things ,",Project Manager
5366,9,"Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
5367,9,I don't think they use {disfmarker},Project Manager
5368,9,"Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,",Marketing
5369,9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5370,9,"that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,",Marketing
5371,9,"Mm , yeah , the age gap .",Project Manager
5372,9,"Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .",Industrial Designer
5373,9,Mm .,Project Manager
5374,9,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
5375,9,"I don't know , I d",Project Manager
5376,9,But I don't know how {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5377,9,"I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .",Project Manager
5378,9,Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer
5379,9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5380,9,"I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one",Project Manager
5381,9,Right .,Marketing
5382,9,"and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .",Project Manager
5383,9,"Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,",Industrial Designer
5384,9,{vocalsound},Marketing
5385,9,Yeah .,Project Manager
5386,9,"you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .",Industrial Designer
5387,9,Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?,Marketing
5388,9,Okay .,User Interface
5389,9,Teletext has got that option as well .,Project Manager
5390,9,"Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .",Marketing
5391,9,"Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things",Project Manager
5392,9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5393,9,"and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .",Project Manager
5394,9,"{vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .",Marketing
5395,9,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
5396,9,"Mm , okay . S",User Interface
5397,9,"I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5398,9,Y,Industrial Designer
5399,9,It might,User Interface
5400,9,Yeah ?,Marketing
5401,9,"it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .",User Interface
5402,9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5403,9,"Yes , no that's important .",Project Manager
5404,9,But it might have its cost implications .,User Interface
5405,9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5406,9,"Yeah , like smaller .",Marketing
5407,9,Okay .,Project Manager
5408,9,"And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?",Marketing
5409,9,Mm .,Project Manager
5410,9,Right .,User Interface
5411,9,Something that's easily moulded and produced .,Marketing
5412,9,Yeah .,Project Manager
5413,9,Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . {vocalsound},Marketing
5414,9,"{vocalsound} Um , right , okay",Project Manager
5415,9,No uh uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5416,9,"we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .",Project Manager
5417,9,Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5418,9,Sure .,Project Manager
5419,9,"about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui",Industrial Designer
5420,9,Ah right .,Marketing
5421,9,Okay .,User Interface
5422,9,Okay .,Project Manager
5423,9,Okay .,Marketing
5424,9,I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic,Industrial Designer
5425,9,Sure b y yeah .,Marketing
5426,9,and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5427,9,"But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point ,",Marketing
5428,9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5429,9,"we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,",Marketing
5430,9,Mm .,Project Manager
5431,9,I presume it would .,Marketing
5432,9,I would {disfmarker},Project Manager
5433,9,Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5434,9,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
5435,9,"it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,",Project Manager
5436,9,Right .,Marketing
5437,9,so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .,Project Manager
5438,9,Okay .,Marketing
5439,9,"Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ?",Project Manager
5440,9,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5441,9,'Kay .,Marketing
5442,9,"So , see you in half an hour .",Project Manager
5443,9,Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?,Marketing
5444,9,"Mm , yeah .",User Interface
5445,9,"I think so , yeah .",Project Manager
5446,10,{vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .,Project Manager
5447,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5448,10,"So ,",Project Manager
5449,10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5450,10,as the previous meeting I will be the secretary,Project Manager
5451,10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5452,10,and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
5453,10,"No y you do the minutes first , or ?",Marketing
5454,10,What ?,Project Manager
5455,10,No ?,Marketing
5456,10,"I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .",Project Manager
5457,10,Okay .,Marketing
5458,10,Yep .,User Interface
5459,10,"So , we'll {disfmarker} S",Project Manager
5460,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5461,10,technical accessoire ?,Project Manager
5462,10,No no no .,User Interface
5463,10,Interface ?,Project Manager
5464,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5465,10,This .,Project Manager
5466,10,"Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um",User Interface
5467,10,Mm .,Industrial Designer
5468,10,Mm .,Marketing
5469,10,A nice one .,Industrial Designer
5470,10,"attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .",User Interface
5471,10,{vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .,Project Manager
5472,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5473,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5474,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know",User Interface
5475,10,"{vocalsound} It's very big ,",Project Manager
5476,10,if you're {disfmarker},User Interface
5477,10,{vocalsound} yeah .,Project Manager
5478,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5479,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5480,10,"It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,",User Interface
5481,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5482,10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
5483,10,yeah .,User Interface
5484,10,"Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
5485,10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
5486,10,"We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,",Project Manager
5487,10,{vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5488,10,so .,Project Manager
5489,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5490,10,Mm .,Marketing
5491,10,"So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,",User Interface
5492,10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
5493,10,Mm .,Marketing
5494,10,"so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .",User Interface
5495,10,Okay . Something else ?,Project Manager
5496,10,Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .,User Interface
5497,10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5498,10,"I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,",Project Manager
5499,10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
5500,10,"but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?",Project Manager
5501,10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
5502,10,"Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?",Project Manager
5503,10,Y,User Interface
5504,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5505,10,{vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .,Industrial Designer
5506,10,"or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?",Project Manager
5507,10,Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .,User Interface
5508,10,"Yeah , sure .",Project Manager
5509,10,"For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .",User Interface
5510,10,I,Project Manager
5511,10,"Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so .",Industrial Designer
5512,10,That's true . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5513,10,One and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5514,10,"Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .",Project Manager
5515,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5516,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5517,10,Mm .,Marketing
5518,10,So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . {vocalsound},User Interface
5519,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5520,10,Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?,Marketing
5521,10,Broken arm ?,Project Manager
5522,10,For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker},User Interface
5523,10,Okay . Okay .,Marketing
5524,10,"Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?",Project Manager
5525,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5526,10,{vocalsound} Yep . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5527,10,But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway .,Marketing
5528,10,Why ?,Project Manager
5529,10,"Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .",User Interface
5530,10,If you have one brother and one sister,Project Manager
5531,10,Yeah {disfmarker},Marketing
5532,10,"and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,",Project Manager
5533,10,"Yeah , but the {disfmarker}",Marketing
5534,10,"so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,",Project Manager
5535,10,{vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah,Industrial Designer
5536,10,"Yeah , it's very interesting . {vocalsound}",User Interface
5537,10,Yeah but this {disfmarker},Marketing
5538,10,so .,Project Manager
5539,10,but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control,Industrial Designer
5540,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5541,10,because the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5542,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5543,10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
5544,10,I don't think it {disfmarker},Marketing
5545,10,"but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .",Project Manager
5546,10,{vocalsound} That's right .,Industrial Designer
5547,10,You're not you're not obliged to share it .,Project Manager
5548,10,"Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .",Marketing
5549,10,"Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
5550,10,"Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,",User Interface
5551,10,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5552,10,No .,Marketing
5553,10,"so it's c come to channel three ,",User Interface
5554,10,"No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .",Marketing
5555,10,I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface
5556,10,"Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .",Project Manager
5557,10,It's advantage .,User Interface
5558,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5559,10,And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to,Industrial Designer
5560,10,"Yeah , but one other question .",Project Manager
5561,10,"manual controllers , eh .",Industrial Designer
5562,10,How how much will it cost ?,Project Manager
5563,10,"No , more expensive maybe .",Industrial Designer
5564,10,How much ?,User Interface
5565,10,Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .,Project Manager
5566,10,No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker},User Interface
5567,10,Some some efficient .,Project Manager
5568,10,Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker},Marketing
5569,10,"No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .",User Interface
5570,10,So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ? Or ?,Project Manager
5571,10,"Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}",User Interface
5572,10,"Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5573,10,it's uh {disfmarker} yeah . It's {disfmarker},User Interface
5574,10,"But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .",Marketing
5575,10,"Well y y you have also the language problem ,",Industrial Designer
5576,10,No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface
5577,10,you know when you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5578,10,Mm-mm .,Project Manager
5579,10,"'Cause it it have to be universal ,",Industrial Designer
5580,10,Yeah . I agree with uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
5581,10,so .,Industrial Designer
5582,10,"The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .",User Interface
5583,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5584,10,"Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international",Project Manager
5585,10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5586,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5587,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5588,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5589,10,remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .,Project Manager
5590,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5591,10,"The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,",Project Manager
5592,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5593,10,so .,Project Manager
5594,10,"Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation",User Interface
5595,10,"Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}",Marketing
5596,10,Yeah but you know . The product {disfmarker} The pro,Industrial Designer
5597,10,mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .,User Interface
5598,10,"{vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
5599,10,"Mm , okay .",Project Manager
5600,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5601,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",User Interface
5602,10,And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?,Project Manager
5603,10,it's {disfmarker},User Interface
5604,10,Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5605,10,Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .,User Interface
5606,10,"Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5607,10,So {disfmarker},User Interface
5608,10,"Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .",Industrial Designer
5609,10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
5610,10,"If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .",Industrial Designer
5611,10,Mm .,Marketing
5612,10,"Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .",User Interface
5613,10,"Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,",Industrial Designer
5614,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5615,10,because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5616,10,Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker},User Interface
5617,10,Oh really ? {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5618,10,Oh .,Project Manager
5619,10,"Yeah ,",Marketing
5620,10,Seems to be quite complex .,Project Manager
5621,10,"but then w Yeah ,",Marketing
5622,10,Comple,Industrial Designer
5623,10,"No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} .",User Interface
5624,10,we have to take care of the twelve Euros,Marketing
5625,10,"And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?",Project Manager
5626,10,problem .,Marketing
5627,10,And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?,Project Manager
5628,10,No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller .,User Interface
5629,10,"Yeah , but where is the controller ?",Project Manager
5630,10,Okay .,Marketing
5631,10,Where is the controller ?,User Interface
5632,10,Yeah .,Project Manager
5633,10,"It's in your family , in your home . {vocalsound}",User Interface
5634,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5635,10,"Yeah , but we're {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5636,10,"No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker}",Marketing
5637,10,here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .,Project Manager
5638,10,Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .,User Interface
5639,10,A microphone maybe .,Industrial Designer
5640,10,"Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .",Project Manager
5641,10,To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .,Industrial Designer
5642,10,You just want to interact with television .,Project Manager
5643,10,"Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you",User Interface
5644,10,"I if you say one , he switch to channel ,",Industrial Designer
5645,10,you use your command,User Interface
5646,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager
5647,10,yeah .,Industrial Designer
5648,10,and you do s your gesture .,User Interface
5649,10,but you can lose it . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5650,10,No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker},User Interface
5651,10,So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .,Industrial Designer
5652,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5653,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5654,10,Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box,Project Manager
5655,10,Devic,Industrial Designer
5656,10,and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .,Project Manager
5657,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5658,10,Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control .,Industrial Designer
5659,10,Ah .,Project Manager
5660,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5661,10,But you would still have the buttons . Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?,Marketing
5662,10,think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker},User Interface
5663,10,"Okay , so you {disfmarker}",Marketing
5664,10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
5665,10,yeah .,User Interface
5666,10,yeah .,Marketing
5667,10,You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another .,User Interface
5668,10,Mm .,Project Manager
5669,10,"Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .",Marketing
5670,10,I think so .,Project Manager
5671,10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5672,10,"No ,",User Interface
5673,10,And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker},Project Manager
5674,10,that's quite inter quite attractive .,User Interface
5675,10,"But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y",Industrial Designer
5676,10,"Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . {vocalsound}",User Interface
5677,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Marketing
5678,10,Yeah but i i {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5679,10,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5680,10,I dunno .,Marketing
5681,10,We should have confidence in technology . {vocalsound},User Interface
5682,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , we should . {vocalsound} Uh .",Industrial Designer
5683,10,"Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .",Project Manager
5684,10,Mm .,Industrial Designer
5685,10,What ?,Marketing
5686,10,"Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?",Project Manager
5687,10,"If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .",Marketing
5688,10,"More features , yeah .",User Interface
5689,10,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5690,10,But if if if it like doubles uh,Marketing
5691,10,"I think he need a control that is very reliable ,",Industrial Designer
5692,10,no one would would be interested .,Marketing
5693,10,so .,Industrial Designer
5694,10,So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?,Project Manager
5695,10,{vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5696,10,{vocalsound},User Interface
5697,10,"Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?",Project Manager
5698,10,"Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?",User Interface
5699,10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5700,10,"Yeah . No ,",Marketing
5701,10,Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker},User Interface
5702,10,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing
5703,10,It's not really the {disfmarker} we,Industrial Designer
5704,10,Y,Marketing
5705,10,"we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that . But uh I think a user need {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5706,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,",User Interface
5707,10,"No ,",Marketing
5708,10,but {disfmarker},User Interface
5709,10,"but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,",Marketing
5710,10,Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah,Industrial Designer
5711,10,Okay .,User Interface
5712,10,or {disfmarker},Marketing
5713,10,if we can send email from it .,Industrial Designer
5714,10,"But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .",User Interface
5715,10,No . No .,Marketing
5716,10,Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5717,10,Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing
5718,10,"Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,",User Interface
5719,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5720,10,"Yeah , but uh we want so",Project Manager
5721,10,"but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .",User Interface
5722,10,"Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker}",Marketing
5723,10,That's {disfmarker},User Interface
5724,10,True .,Marketing
5725,10,"the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products .",User Interface
5726,10,"Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .",Project Manager
5727,10,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5728,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5729,10,"{vocalsound} And for all the person of the family maybe ,",Industrial Designer
5730,10,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
5731,10,You don't need to tune it .,Project Manager
5732,10,"so , yeah .",Industrial Designer
5733,10,"Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?",User Interface
5734,10,"Yeah , why not ? If it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5735,10,"I mean , for example the goo y",Marketing
5736,10,Because you have new {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5737,10,you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .,Marketing
5738,10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
5739,10,"I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine ,",Marketing
5740,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5741,10,"so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .",Marketing
5742,10,"Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .",User Interface
5743,10,"Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition",Marketing
5744,10,The {disfmarker} then nn,User Interface
5745,10,or {disfmarker},Marketing
5746,10,no .,User Interface
5747,10,"if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .",Marketing
5748,10,Tha,User Interface
5749,10,Not too expensive too .,Project Manager
5750,10,But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .,User Interface
5751,10,See {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Marketing
5752,10,That's the same {disfmarker},User Interface
5753,10,"That's the problem ,",Marketing
5754,10,yeah .,User Interface
5755,10,"yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .",Marketing
5756,10,{vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5757,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5758,10,"But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product",Marketing
5759,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5760,10,and so .,Marketing
5761,10,Okay . So,Project Manager
5762,10,"I mean , that's the point .",Marketing
5763,10,let's go to the Industrial Designer .,Project Manager
5764,10,{vocalsound},User Interface
5765,10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5766,10,Okay .,User Interface
5767,10,"Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .",Project Manager
5768,10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5769,10,Yeah .,User Interface
5770,10,Two ?,Project Manager
5771,10,"Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5772,10,Working ?,Project Manager
5773,10,"Yeah , working design ,",Industrial Designer
5774,10,{vocalsound},User Interface
5775,10,so .,Industrial Designer
5776,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5777,10,So I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5778,10,I can {disfmarker},Project Manager
5779,10,Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ? I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one .,Industrial Designer
5780,10,Okay .,Project Manager
5781,10,It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5782,10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing
5783,10,It's the working design . Sorry . {vocalsound} Component design .,Industrial Designer
5784,10,It's okay {vocalsound},Project Manager
5785,10,So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5786,10,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5787,10,What ? Are you inst,Industrial Designer
5788,10,Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker},Project Manager
5789,10,It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .,User Interface
5790,10,Maybe you you record it somewhere else .,Project Manager
5791,10,I don't think so .,Industrial Designer
5792,10,Participant one . Participant one .,User Interface
5793,10,Interface concept . No .,Project Manager
5794,10,Hmm .,Marketing
5795,10,Mm mm .,Project Manager
5796,10,Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer .,Industrial Designer
5797,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5798,10,Uh . {vocalsound} Nope . {vocalsound},Project Manager
5799,10,Dunno .,Marketing
5800,10,"Okay , okay . Yes .",Industrial Designer
5801,10,It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker},Project Manager
5802,10,I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker},Marketing
5803,10,I can say it to you without .,Industrial Designer
5804,10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5805,10,"Yeah , maybe we can first come to",User Interface
5806,10,"No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
5807,10,"uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,",User Interface
5808,10,"I think it's more interesting what he says ,",Marketing
5809,10,Yeah .,Project Manager
5810,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
5811,10,then present it later .,User Interface
5812,10,okay .,Marketing
5813,10,exac,Industrial Designer
5814,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5815,10,You will had s some more information in {disfmarker},Project Manager
5816,10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5817,10,I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .,Project Manager
5818,10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5819,10,"Yeah , true .",Marketing
5820,10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5821,10,Okay . {vocalsound},User Interface
5822,10,"In fact , I don't know ,",Industrial Designer
5823,10,So . Okay .,Project Manager
5824,10,I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5825,10,{vocalsound},User Interface
5826,10,"Okay , never mind .",Project Manager
5827,10,so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r,Industrial Designer
5828,10,Okay .,User Interface
5829,10,{vocalsound},Marketing
5830,10,of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside,Industrial Designer
5831,10,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
5832,10,"and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,",Industrial Designer
5833,10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
5834,10,"so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,",Industrial Designer
5835,10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
5836,10,"so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,",Industrial Designer
5837,10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
5838,10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
5839,10,"or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .",Industrial Designer
5840,10,Okay .,Project Manager
5841,10,Okay .,User Interface
5842,10,"And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation",Industrial Designer
5843,10,Uh-huh .,User Interface
5844,10,"or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come",Industrial Designer
5845,10,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,User Interface
5846,10,"and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .",Industrial Designer
5847,10,"Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control",Project Manager
5848,10,"Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .",Industrial Designer
5849,10,and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers,Project Manager
5850,10,"Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
5851,10,Yeah . Yeah .,Marketing
5852,10,"and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,",Project Manager
5853,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5854,10,no ?,Project Manager
5855,10,"Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,",Industrial Designer
5856,10,So .,Project Manager
5857,10,"but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,",Industrial Designer
5858,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5859,10,Okay .,Project Manager
5860,10,so hmm .,Industrial Designer
5861,10,And what tha what about the uh materials ?,Project Manager
5862,10,"And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common",Industrial Designer
5863,10,"Impersonal , mm-hmm .",Project Manager
5864,10,"it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,",Industrial Designer
5865,10,Yeah .,Project Manager
5866,10,Special for {disfmarker},Marketing
5867,10,"or you know , you can have some {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5868,10,"Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .",Project Manager
5869,10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
5870,10,"Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood",Industrial Designer
5871,10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
5872,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5873,10,Mm-hmm . Mm .,Project Manager
5874,10,and it can be interesting .,Industrial Designer
5875,10,"Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .",Project Manager
5876,10,"And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .",Industrial Designer
5877,10,"Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .",Project Manager
5878,10,"Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
5879,10,And you think that we will be {disfmarker},Project Manager
5880,10,"Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,",Industrial Designer
5881,10,Okay .,Project Manager
5882,10,so .,Industrial Designer
5883,10,So wood .,Project Manager
5884,10,{gap},Industrial Designer
5885,10,And what about the buttons ?,Project Manager
5886,10,"I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion",Industrial Designer
5887,10,"No it's fashion , yeah .",Project Manager
5888,10,"and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .",Industrial Designer
5889,10,What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .,Marketing
5890,10,{vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .,Industrial Designer
5891,10,Mm .,Marketing
5892,10,"But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
5893,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5894,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
5895,10,So you got email ?,User Interface
5896,10,I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .,Project Manager
5897,10,Okay .,Marketing
5898,10,Participant four ? Functional requirements ?,Project Manager
5899,10,"Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}",Marketing
5900,10,This one ?,Project Manager
5901,10,"Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .",Marketing
5902,10,{vocalsound},Project Manager
5903,10,"So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically",Marketing
5904,10,Mm .,User Interface
5905,10,Mm .,Industrial Designer
5906,10,"but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .",Marketing
5907,10,Okay .,Project Manager
5908,10,"At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .",Marketing
5909,10,{gap},Industrial Designer
5910,10,"Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,",Marketing
5911,10,Ah yes .,Industrial Designer
5912,10,"okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .",Marketing
5913,10,"Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer
5914,10,"'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .",Marketing
5915,10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5916,10,"So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris",Marketing
5917,10,And fruit and vegetables yeah .,Industrial Designer
5918,10,"we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,",Marketing
5919,10,{vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .,Industrial Designer
5920,10,okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .,Marketing
5921,10,"Okay , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
5922,10,I dunno .,Marketing
5923,10,"Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?",Industrial Designer
5924,10,Yeah thi this is this would be like um,Marketing
5925,10,Pla S,Industrial Designer
5926,10,"plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh",Marketing
5927,10,"Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .",Industrial Designer
5928,10,"device , so um",Marketing
5929,10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5930,10,"Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .",Marketing
5931,10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5932,10,"So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,",Project Manager
5933,10,Yeah . Solar .,Industrial Designer
5934,10,"Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}",Marketing
5935,10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5936,10,maybe will attract,Project Manager
5937,10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer

5940,10,pro-ecology consumers .,Project Manager
5941,10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5942,10,Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .,Project Manager
5943,10,"Yeah , I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . Yeah .",Industrial Designer
5944,10,Case .,Project Manager
5945,10,Later ? {vocalsound},User Interface
5946,10,So you think {gap} case . Something spongy . {vocalsound} Someth no wood .,Project Manager

5956,10,"Yeah , maybe the base .",Marketing
5957,10,so .,Industrial Designer
5958,10,It's it's natural .,Project Manager
5959,10,But still y,Marketing
5960,10,"Th The feeling is natural ,",Project Manager
5961,10,"Yeah , it's natural",Industrial Designer
5962,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5963,10,and i,Industrial Designer
5964,10,so maybe we can stay with wood .,Project Manager
5965,10,"And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol",Industrial Designer
5966,10,"Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .",Marketing
5967,10,"Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .",Industrial Designer
5968,10,But it's still fashion .,Project Manager
5969,10,"But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,",Marketing
5970,10,Okay .,Industrial Designer
5971,10,or,Marketing
5972,10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
5973,10,I dunno .,Marketing
5974,10,something that you can {vocalsound} into it .,Project Manager
5975,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5976,10,Uh and what about the user interface concept ?,Project Manager
5977,10,{vocalsound} Google and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
5978,10,Google and fancy ?,Project Manager
5979,10,"and fancy , f how about the the voice ? {vocalsound} And {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
5980,10,Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .,Project Manager
5981,10,Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested,Industrial Designer
5982,10,Uh yes .,User Interface
5983,10,and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control .,Industrial Designer
5984,10,Yeah .,Marketing
5985,10,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
5986,10,Mm . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
5987,10,The smart controller . {vocalsound},User Interface
5988,10,"But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,",Industrial Designer
5989,10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager
5990,10,so .,Industrial Designer
5991,10,but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .,Project Manager
5992,10,"But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .",Industrial Designer
5993,10,That's true .,Project Manager
5994,10,Yeah {disfmarker} d,Marketing
5995,10,Okay .,User Interface
5996,10,"So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,",Project Manager
5997,10,I dunno .,Marketing
5998,10,Mm .,User Interface
5999,10,"maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .",Project Manager
6000,10,Yeah . It's good .,User Interface
6001,10,And L_C_D_ buttons .,Project Manager
6002,10,"Yeah , L_C_D_ .",Industrial Designer
6003,10,"Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .",Project Manager
6004,10,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6005,10,What interface ?,Marketing
6006,10,"Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value .",Project Manager
6007,10,"I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6008,10,With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use,Project Manager
6009,10,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
6010,10,"commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .",Project Manager
6011,10,Yeah . Mm .,Industrial Designer
6012,10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface

6014,10,Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .,Project Manager
6015,10,"Yeah , turning {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,",Industrial Designer
6016,10,"So ,",Project Manager
6017,10,so .,Industrial Designer
6018,10,adding some vocal commands .,Project Manager
6019,10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6020,10,Simple ones ?,Project Manager

6022,10,"Okay . {vocalsound} So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} we'll {disfmarker} you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .",Project Manager
6023,10,Yeah .,User Interface
6024,10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6025,10,Yep . Yeah .,User Interface
6026,10,"Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons {vocalsound}",Project Manager
6027,10,"{vocalsound} expensive buttons {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , to make some new {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6028,10,and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .,Project Manager
6029,10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6030,10,{vocalsound} And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .,Project Manager

Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6055,11,And I can start if you want . Mm .,Marketing
6056,11,sure .,Project Manager
6057,11,Is there an order ? No .,Marketing

6061,11,"First . Okay . Um , how do I put this {disfmarker}",Marketing
6062,11,Just uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6063,11,I'll just put the cable in .,Marketing
6064,11,"Oh yeah , sorry .",Project Manager
6065,11,"{gap} Is that it ? Can you see ? {vocalsound} Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ?",Marketing
6066,11,It sh it takes a few seconds I think .,Project Manager

6071,11,No .,Marketing
6072,11,But sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6073,11,Is it in the right thing ?,Marketing
6074,11,"it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .",Industrial Designer
6075,11,"Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . {vocalsound}",Marketing
6076,11,"Uh-huh , and then press function .",Project Manager
6077,11,{vocalsound},Marketing
6078,11,and F_ eight .,Project Manager
6079,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6080,11,Could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker},User Interface
6081,11,"Oh , wait .",Marketing
6082,11,oh .,User Interface
6083,11,That's {disfmarker} is that it ?,Marketing
6084,11,Adjusting .,Industrial Designer
6085,11,Here we are . {vocalsound},Project Manager
6086,11,"The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .",Industrial Designer
6087,11,Right here we are .,Marketing
6088,11,Oh . Is it on ?,Project Manager
6089,11,We're here .,Marketing
6090,11,Okay .,Project Manager
6091,11,"Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .",Marketing
6092,11,Hm .,Project Manager
6093,11,"Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .",Marketing
6094,11,'Kay .,Project Manager
6095,11,Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?,Marketing
6096,11,Yeah . Just move right on .,Project Manager
6097,11,"Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?",User Interface
6098,11,{vocalsound} Uh function F_ eight .,Project Manager
6099,11,Function F_ eight .,Marketing
6100,11,'Kay . What's function ?,User Interface

6102,11,"Oh function , I see it .",User Interface
6103,11,yeah . Yeah should be {disfmarker},Project Manager
6104,11,There we go . {vocalsound},User Interface
6105,11,It should be {gap} yeah .,Project Manager
6106,11,Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} .,User Interface
6107,11,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6108,11,"And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .",User Interface
6109,11,{gap},Project Manager
6110,11,Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh .,User Interface
6111,11,How do I um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6112,11,S That's on view .,Marketing
6113,11,Right .,Industrial Designer
6114,11,Oh .,Marketing
6115,11,"Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .",Industrial Designer
6116,11,'Kay .,Project Manager
6117,11,Do you know about like {disfmarker},User Interface

6121,11,Okay . Cool . {vocalsound},User Interface
6122,11,"Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in .

6123,11,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6124,11,"also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . {vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6125,11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6126,11,"I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker}",Project Manager

6129,11,"how it looks , or like what it does ?",User Interface
6130,11,wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s,Project Manager
6131,11,Okay .,User Interface
6132,11,the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .,Project Manager
6133,11,Yeah . Okay . So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?,User Interface
6134,11,{vocalsound} I think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . Mm .,Project Manager
6135,11,So {disfmarker},User Interface
6136,11,It's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer

6143,11,"Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .",Project Manager
6144,11,what was it ?,User Interface
6145,11,Well that's for speech recognition .,Marketing
6146,11,"Oh , uh .",Project Manager
6147,11,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6148,11,Oh .,User Interface
6149,11,And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .,Marketing
6150,11,"I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,",Industrial Designer
6151,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6152,11,"and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,",Industrial Designer
6153,11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing

6163,11,{vocalsound},User Interface
6164,11,"But um the screen is the same as what , {gap}",Marketing
6165,11,It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer

6172,11,Hu yeah .,User Interface
6173,11,{vocalsound} Completely .,Marketing
6174,11,Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .,User Interface
6175,11,Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .,Industrial Designer
6176,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6177,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6178,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6179,11,"Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .",Industrial Designer
6180,11,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
6181,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6182,11,Okay .,Project Manager
6183,11,Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .,Industrial Designer
6184,11,Alright .,User Interface
6185,11,Okay .,Marketing
6186,11,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface
6187,11,So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker},Project Manager
6188,11,It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
6189,11,"right . Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
6190,11,"So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?",Marketing
6191,11,"Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .",Industrial Designer
6192,11,Okay . Okay .,Marketing
6193,11,So it's now like a two-part thing .,User Interface

6195,11,Okay . Alright .,User Interface
6196,11,Okay .,Marketing

6203,11,Huh . Okay .,Project Manager
6204,11,Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it .,Marketing
6205,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6206,11,Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?,Marketing
6207,11,"We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6208,11,Okay .,Marketing
6209,11,Yeah . Then it can live anywhere .,User Interface
6210,11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager
6211,11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6212,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6213,11,"Okay . For the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?",Marketing
6214,11,Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ?,Industrial Designer
6215,11,Are we just having a radio ? On the phone .,Marketing
6216,11,"Um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,",Industrial Designer
6217,11,T,User Interface
6218,11,You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing
6219,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6220,11,"I think that's what the phone has ,",Industrial Designer
6221,11,Yeah yeah .,Marketing
6222,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6223,11,"I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .",Industrial Designer
6224,11,"And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so",Project Manager
6225,11,You can hear it's under the couch yeah .,Marketing
6226,11,{disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
6227,11,So i Yeah .,User Interface
6228,11,"Um , {vocalsound} {gap} So need the other buttons . So we have this {disfmarker} mm .",Marketing
6229,11,"So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um ,",Project Manager
6230,11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6231,11,That was that was me .,User Interface
6232,11,Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},Marketing
6233,11,"they're {disfmarker} I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .",Project Manager
6234,11,I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes .,User Interface
6235,11,"Oh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .",Project Manager
6236,11,And uh,User Interface
6237,11,Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ?,Industrial Designer
6238,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6239,11,They're not {disfmarker} no .,Project Manager
6240,11,"They're not , no .",Marketing
6241,11,"Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .",Industrial Designer
6242,11,S,User Interface
6243,11,"Yeah , that's right , yeah .",Project Manager
6244,11,{vocalsound} It not V_H_S_ here ?,Marketing
6245,11,But D_V_D_ probably is .,Project Manager
6246,11,"Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .",Industrial Designer
6247,11,Um {disfmarker},User Interface
6248,11,"And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .",Project Manager
6249,11,"But V_C_R_s {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , for sure .",Marketing
6250,11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
6251,11,"Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,",User Interface
6252,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6253,11,"like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .",User Interface
6254,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6255,11,"Well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much ,",Marketing
6256,11,S,Project Manager
6257,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6258,11,Huh .,Project Manager
6259,11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
6260,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6261,11,s and it's usually that red,Marketing
6262,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6263,11,and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .,Marketing
6264,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6265,11,"You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6266,11,"Oh okay , yeah .",Marketing
6267,11,It seems like that would be hard though .,User Interface
6268,11,But {disfmarker},Project Manager
6269,11,"I mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker}",User Interface
6270,11,It might be confusing . Yeah .,Project Manager
6271,11,yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't {disfmarker} I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound},User Interface
6272,11,Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .,Project Manager
6273,11,"Yeah , I never think to hold something down . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
6274,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6275,11,{vocalsound} I have the power {vocalsound},Project Manager
6276,11,Yeah . B {vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface
6277,11,I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .,Project Manager
6278,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6279,11,"Well even um iPod thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of",Marketing
6280,11,"That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .",User Interface
6281,11,scrolling {disfmarker} I don't know .,Marketing
6282,11,Mm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
6283,11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6284,11,Yeah . Because people li seem {disfmarker} now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no {disfmarker} Know you don't have one two three four five {disfmarker},Marketing
6285,11,"Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,",User Interface
6286,11,Mm .,Project Manager
6287,11,"it's it's funny like you f like I just {disfmarker} I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and {disfmarker} it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .",User Interface
6288,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6289,11,"Yeah yeah , it's just {disfmarker} and it's one thing which has everything .",Marketing
6290,11,"Yeah , and it is {disfmarker} yeah . It is really {disfmarker} but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?",User Interface
6291,11,Well can't it tell the {disfmarker} like can't you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker},Marketing
6292,11,"Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .",Industrial Designer
6293,11,Yeah . Okay .,User Interface
6294,11,you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker},Marketing
6295,11,Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .,User Interface
6296,11,Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
6297,11,Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .,User Interface
6298,11,okay . I've never used one . No .,Project Manager
6299,11,"It's like l this {disfmarker} like that , and then you do that .",Marketing
6300,11,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
6301,11,Yeah . Yeah and then .,User Interface
6302,11,"And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .",Marketing
6303,11,Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker},User Interface
6304,11,"Yeah , you can {disfmarker}",Marketing
6305,11,Well i,Project Manager
6306,11,zap .,User Interface
6307,11,"Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker}",Marketing
6308,11,Okay .,User Interface
6309,11,"We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .",Project Manager
6310,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6311,11,Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom {disfmarker} So do you need to {disfmarker},User Interface
6312,11,"Doesn't it rotate though ,",Industrial Designer
6313,11,okay .,User Interface
6314,11,so it'll be moving around .,Industrial Designer
6315,11,Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker},User Interface
6316,11,What do you mean the function ?,Marketing
6317,11,"I mean like okay , 'cause so {disfmarker} I dunno , I guess {disfmarker} Okay {disfmarker} so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .",User Interface
6318,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6319,11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
6320,11,But then {disfmarker},User Interface
6321,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6322,11,"so if you wanna switch to the {disfmarker} to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .",User Interface
6323,11,Yeah but it knows for some reason .,Marketing
6324,11,It just {disfmarker},User Interface
6325,11,The iPod knows .,Marketing
6326,11,It just kno {vocalsound} the iPod knows . {vocalsound} S,User Interface
6327,11,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6328,11,{vocalsound} If it works on an iPod then it works .,Industrial Designer
6329,11,{vocalsound},Marketing
6330,11,Huh .,Project Manager
6331,11,Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .,User Interface
6332,11,I don't have one .,Industrial Designer
6333,11,"Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .",Marketing
6334,11,"Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .",User Interface
6335,11,Oh .,Industrial Designer
6336,11,So it's like holding {disfmarker},Project Manager
6337,11,"And then {disfmarker} well if you do that it goes , but if you {disfmarker} like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .",Marketing
6338,11,You can {disfmarker} o And you you {disfmarker} is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually {disfmarker} you're just using the mouse to go up and down .,Project Manager
6339,11,Well what you {disfmarker},Marketing
6340,11,Like {disfmarker},Project Manager
6341,11,It's like a b,User Interface
6342,11,"for the iPod you press an {disfmarker} w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .",Marketing
6343,11,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
6344,11,"But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker}",Marketing
6345,11,"Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?",Project Manager
6346,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6347,11,Like you could just have {disfmarker},Project Manager
6348,11,"I don't know ,",Marketing
6349,11,"Oh , like {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6350,11,"you could click and then have it up and down ,",Marketing
6351,11,Oh you could actually {disfmarker},Project Manager
6352,11,Like {disfmarker},User Interface
6353,11,but I think {disfmarker},Marketing
6354,11,I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .,User Interface
6355,11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing
6356,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6357,11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
6358,11,"But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be {disfmarker} is that part of {disfmarker}",User Interface
6359,11,Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker},Project Manager
6360,11,{vocalsound} I don't think so .,Industrial Designer
6361,11,"yeah , I dunno , I dunno .",User Interface
6362,11,"they have so much memory though , that's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6363,11,You don't think so ? Okay .,User Interface
6364,11,I don't think it's the wheel dealy .,Industrial Designer
6365,11,I think it {disfmarker},Marketing
6366,11,Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they {disfmarker} it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .,Project Manager
6367,11,Okay .,User Interface
6368,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6369,11,Yeah . {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
6370,11,Yeah . I'm thinking we could {disfmarker} if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .,User Interface
6371,11,And they're re-programmable aren't they ?,Industrial Designer
6372,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6373,11,"You can put on your songs and then put on a different set ,",Industrial Designer
6374,11,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
6375,11,"that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .",Industrial Designer
6376,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6377,11,S,Project Manager
6378,11,"Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker}",User Interface
6379,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6380,11,Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6381,11,"Yeah yeah yeah . Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation {vocalsound} , is that people find it {disfmarker} find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote",Marketing
6382,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6383,11,and that's another thing they complained about .,Marketing
6384,11,Mm .,Project Manager
6385,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6386,11,"Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume {disfmarker} oh we've ts just said that .",Marketing
6387,11,So okay .,User Interface
6388,11,Channel selection .,Marketing
6389,11,"This is just for T_V_ , it's not for {disfmarker} or it is {disfmarker} does need to be compatible with {disfmarker}",User Interface
6390,11,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
6391,11,"I {disfmarker} A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,",Industrial Designer
6392,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6393,11,"You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .",Project Manager
6394,11,So how do you switch {disfmarker},User Interface
6395,11,Menu .,Marketing
6396,11,and menu maybe . Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer
6397,11,So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker},Project Manager
6398,11,Okay . So like if we had that {disfmarker},User Interface
6399,11,But we'll hold off on that 'cause {disfmarker},Project Manager
6400,11,Yeah .,User Interface
6401,11,But s yeah uh .,Project Manager
6402,11,But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .,Marketing
6403,11,"That's true , yeah .",User Interface
6404,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6405,11,"So , I know I'm not c really clear on what {disfmarker}",User Interface
6406,11,"But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .",Industrial Designer
6407,11,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface
6408,11,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing
6409,11,Mm . Mm .,Project Manager
6410,11,So you'd have to have like {disfmarker},User Interface
6411,11,Yeah .,Marketing
6412,11,"I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So {disfmarker}",User Interface
6413,11,Yeah .,Project Manager
6414,11,Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .,Industrial Designer
6415,11,"Yeah ,",User Interface
6416,11,"Yeah , it is only fun",Marketing
6417,11,"but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .",User Interface
6418,11,But i Yeah .,Project Manager
6419,11,Oh . But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6420,11,Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker},User Interface
6421,11,but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .,Industrial Designer
6422,11,"So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that ,",User Interface
6423,11,"Um , yeah , let's think about it",Project Manager
6424,11,that like {disfmarker},User Interface
6425,11,Yes we can try that .,Industrial Designer
6426,11,'cause we need to wrap up .,Project Manager

6464,12,"Okay ,",Project Manager
6465,12,just tell us .,User Interface
6466,12,"we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones .

6467,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6468,12,Okay .,Project Manager

6473,12,"{gap} {vocalsound} No . Okay well {disfmarker} I received an email {disfmarker} Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . {vocalsound} The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .",Marketing
6474,12,Hmm .,User Interface
6475,12,"But um {vocalsound} this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .",Marketing
6476,12,But we already have the flashing flashing light on the {disfmarker},Project Manager
6477,12,{vocalsound} Uh maybe maybe something new .,Marketing

6483,12,features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .,Marketing
6484,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6485,12,"So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .",Marketing
6486,12,Hmm .,Project Manager
6487,12,"But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .",Marketing
6488,12,Spongy .,User Interface
6489,12,"But spongy , what what does spongy says ?",Marketing
6490,12,Spongy .,Industrial Designer
6491,12,"Spongy , like sponge .",User Interface
6492,12,Spongy . Okay . {vocalsound},Marketing
6493,12,"So rubber , kind of .",Industrial Designer
6494,12,Uh soft materials .,User Interface
6495,12,"But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,",Project Manager
6496,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6497,12,because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be {vocalsound} flexible .,Project Manager
6498,12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface
6499,12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6500,12,"Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .",Marketing
6501,12,It's like a sponge .,Industrial Designer
6502,12,"Soft , sponge .",User Interface
6503,12,So it's also a stress-ball .,Marketing
6504,12,"That's a good {disfmarker} That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea .",Project Manager
6505,12,"Yeah , somewhat like {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6506,12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface
6507,12,Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ?,Project Manager
6508,12,How are you gonna make it ?,User Interface
6509,12,R_ soft .,Project Manager
6510,12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
6511,12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
6512,12,"I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .",Industrial Designer
6513,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6514,12,Okay ?,Marketing
6515,12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6516,12,"What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .",Marketing
6517,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6518,12,Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .,Marketing
6519,12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6520,12,"And uh some basic uh colour fronts . {vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . {vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .",Marketing
6521,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6522,12,"Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .",Marketing
6523,12,"Yeah , I'll get back on that .",User Interface
6524,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
6525,12,So {disfmarker},Marketing
6526,12,{vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .,Project Manager
6527,12,Intro,Marketing
6528,12,Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .,Project Manager
6529,12,Yeah .,Marketing
6530,12,"Well ,",User Interface
6531,12,"Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .",Marketing
6532,12,I got f also an email from the the technology department .,User Interface
6533,12,So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .,Marketing
6534,12,"They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .",User Interface
6535,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6536,12,Well {disfmarker},User Interface
6537,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
6538,12,Okay .,Marketing
6539,12,I'll check what they exact mean .,User Interface
6540,12,Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .,Marketing
6541,12,So uh {disfmarker},User Interface
6542,12,"Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap",Industrial Designer
6543,12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
6544,12,and it's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer
6545,12,"th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh",User Interface
6546,12,{gap},Marketing
6547,12,"if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .",User Interface
6548,12,"Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker}",Marketing
6549,12,Since you have to uh configure speech thing .,User Interface
6550,12,But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
6551,12,"Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .",User Interface
6552,12,"Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} .",Marketing
6553,12,"Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .",Project Manager
6554,12,"Yeah , so uh we gotta de",User Interface
6555,12,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
6556,12,We have to decide on that .,User Interface
6557,12,Yeah . Okay . That was this ?,Marketing
6558,12,Mm uh {disfmarker},User Interface
6559,12,"Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So",Industrial Designer
6560,12,L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker},User Interface
6561,12,"it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .",Industrial Designer
6562,12,Okay . And speech recognition ?,User Interface
6563,12,"Yeah , probably too .",Industrial Designer
6564,12,Advanced {gap} . Yeah .,User Interface
6565,12,"I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6566,12,I'll I'll give you my design .,User Interface
6567,12,"Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .",Industrial Designer
6568,12,Yeah okay . So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .,User Interface
6569,12,"Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .",Project Manager
6570,12,"More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}",User Interface
6571,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
6572,12,"It's the most important part , I think . But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .",User Interface
6573,12,"Yeah , maybe the teletext tel",Project Manager
6574,12,"Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,",User Interface
6575,12,No .,Project Manager
6576,12,but it's {disfmarker},User Interface
6577,12,"No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it .",Marketing
6578,12,Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So {disfmarker},User Interface
6579,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
6580,12,"and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker}",User Interface
6581,12,But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display .,Industrial Designer
6582,12,No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .,User Interface
6583,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6584,12,So the focus is on these two parts .,User Interface
6585,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6586,12,So you don't see all the buttons you else need .,User Interface
6587,12,{vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .,Project Manager
6588,12,Uh well um {disfmarker},User Interface
6589,12,So you can't use your thumb for it .,Project Manager
6590,12,This is how it is now . Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume .,User Interface
6591,12,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
6592,12,I think it is on uh on the bottom too .,Industrial Designer
6593,12,down there . But it's not not the best best .,Project Manager
6594,12,Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use {disfmarker},User Interface
6595,12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
6596,12,"Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel .",Project Manager
6597,12,"Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .",Industrial Designer
6598,12,"Yeah , why not .",Project Manager
6599,12,For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .,User Interface
6600,12,Scroll .,Industrial Designer
6601,12,By just putting the volume on the side .,User Interface
6602,12,And the channels as well .,Project Manager
6603,12,And and just channel buttons here .,User Interface
6604,12,Oh yeah .,Project Manager
6605,12,But I think uh {disfmarker},User Interface
6606,12,"Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .",Industrial Designer
6607,12,"Well . Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here .",User Interface
6608,12,"Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .",Industrial Designer
6609,12,"Yeah , that's better .",Project Manager
6610,12,They're on top ?,User Interface
6611,12,"Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .",Project Manager
6612,12,Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .,Industrial Designer
6613,12,You mean uh these to the low ?,User Interface
6614,12,Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button .,Project Manager
6615,12,"Oh okay . Well , yeah .",User Interface
6616,12,"But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom .",Industrial Designer
6617,12,"Mm {disfmarker} Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker}",User Interface
6618,12,Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .,Industrial Designer
6619,12,"Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .",User Interface
6620,12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
6621,12,"And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good .",User Interface
6622,12,"That's that's good , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6623,12,"{vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .",User Interface
6624,12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
6625,12,"But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .",User Interface
6626,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6627,12,So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker},User Interface
6628,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
6629,12,"I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .",User Interface
6630,12,"No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .",Industrial Designer
6631,12,"Okay . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface
6632,12,"But uh we we can switch those two ,",Industrial Designer
6633,12,"Those two , yeah .",User Interface
6634,12,yeah .,Industrial Designer
6635,12,"And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . {gap}",User Interface
6636,12,Okay .,Marketing
6637,12,"Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .",User Interface
6638,12,"Yeah . Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager
6639,12,To use {disfmarker},User Interface
6640,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6641,12,"So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .",User Interface
6642,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6643,12,No .,Industrial Designer
6644,12,So that's something we have to decide on .,User Interface
6645,12,"Yeah , we have to keep it simple .",Industrial Designer
6646,12,"We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .",Project Manager
6647,12,Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay .,User Interface
6648,12,"Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like .",Industrial Designer
6649,12,"Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
6650,12,{vocalsound},Marketing
6651,12,Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved {gap} square .,User Interface
6652,12,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6653,12,Square . Like .,Marketing
6654,12,"Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .",Industrial Designer
6655,12,Okay . So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
6656,12,So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .,Industrial Designer
6657,12,Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .,User Interface
6658,12,"Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of",Industrial Designer
6659,12,"Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control .",Project Manager
6660,12,"looking , I think .",Industrial Designer
6661,12,Mm .,Marketing
6662,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6663,12,So the colours also .,Project Manager
6664,12,"Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker}",User Interface
6665,12,"So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .",Project Manager
6666,12,Black yellow control . {vocalsound},User Interface
6667,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6668,12,Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .,Project Manager
6669,12,"Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .",Industrial Designer
6670,12,"Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But {disfmarker}",User Interface
6671,12,We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .,Project Manager
6672,12,"No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6673,12,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface
6674,12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6675,12,"We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .",Industrial Designer
6676,12,"Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker}",User Interface
6677,12,"Yeah , it's cool . Yep .",Project Manager
6678,12,Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue,Industrial Designer
6679,12,And still trans,Project Manager
6680,12,Yes .,User Interface
6681,12,Still still transparent .,Project Manager
6682,12,So {disfmarker},User Interface
6683,12,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6684,12,Oh yeah .,Marketing
6685,12,Yeah . But with all with logo on it .,User Interface
6686,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6687,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6688,12,"Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the components . The case has just a {disfmarker} Here's black .",Industrial Designer
6689,12,"Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .",Project Manager
6690,12,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
6691,12,{gap} Yeah .,User Interface
6692,12,"Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?",Industrial Designer
6693,12,Well one of the options .,User Interface
6694,12,S,Industrial Designer
6695,12,"You can {disfmarker} Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .",User Interface
6696,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6697,12,"So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,",User Interface
6698,12,"Yeah , we could do that .",Industrial Designer
6699,12,or just uh release one .,User Interface
6700,12,"Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . {vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6701,12,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Or just uh sell different ones .",User Interface
6702,12,"Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .",Industrial Designer
6703,12,Yeah . Cool .,Project Manager
6704,12,So you can still th look through it .,Industrial Designer
6705,12,Yeah . Yeah .,User Interface
6706,12,Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .,Industrial Designer
6707,12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
6708,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6709,12,I uh I dunno .,User Interface
6710,12,"It it could be like a Nokia , like {gap} plastic .",Project Manager
6711,12,"A more {disfmarker} Yeah , just uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
6712,12,{vocalsound} Uh uh {disfmarker},Marketing
6713,12,That's better prob,Project Manager
6714,12,With the hard hard buttons .,Industrial Designer
6715,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6716,12,I think uh rubber really has an odd look .,User Interface
6717,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6718,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6719,12,"Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .",Marketing
6720,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6721,12,It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't {disfmarker} Is {vocalsound} uh a button uh um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How do you say it ?,Marketing
6722,12,"Yeah , it's it's all on one level .",Industrial Designer
6723,12,It it didn't it i it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background .,Marketing
6724,12,"Yeah , on one level .",Industrial Designer
6725,12,It is in uh the c a remote control uh {disfmarker},Marketing
6726,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6727,12,"Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6728,12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
6729,12,Yeah .,Marketing
6730,12,like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod .,User Interface
6731,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6732,12,Uh just {disfmarker},User Interface
6733,12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
6734,12,"Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager
6735,12,"Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?",Industrial Designer
6736,12,{vocalsound} I dunno what uh kind of material it is .,User Interface
6737,12,I think . Or maybe {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6738,12,But {disfmarker},User Interface
6739,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6740,12,But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh,Project Manager
6741,12,Oops .,User Interface
6742,12,"basic remote control from normal plastic ,",Project Manager
6743,12,{vocalsound},Marketing
6744,12,and,Project Manager
6745,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6746,12,the rounds of it from softer s,Project Manager
6747,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6748,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6749,12,And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the L_E_D_ . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6750,12,I dunno .,Project Manager
6751,12,The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s .,Industrial Designer
6752,12,Y,Project Manager
6753,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6754,12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6755,12,Cool .,Project Manager
6756,12,"But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .",Industrial Designer
6757,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6758,12,So if you put {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6759,12,Y i if you {disfmarker} The numbers could be can be {disfmarker},Project Manager
6760,12,Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh {disfmarker},User Interface
6761,12,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
6762,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6763,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6764,12,Or it runs the whole {disfmarker},User Interface
6765,12,"Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6766,12,They can choose .,Project Manager
6767,12,"Yeah , you can halfs transparent ,",User Interface
6768,12,Or no,Industrial Designer
6769,12,or just that it's comes out a bit .,User Interface
6770,12,"Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights",Industrial Designer
6771,12,"Different , I think , also .",User Interface
6772,12,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6773,12,Blue . {vocalsound},Project Manager
6774,12,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer
6775,12,Blue or red .,User Interface
6776,12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6777,12,"Whatever you want it , I think .",User Interface
6778,12,{gap} Yeah .,Marketing
6779,12,Uh depends on the colour of the {disfmarker},User Interface
6780,12,"Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .",Project Manager
6781,12,Uh i {gap} {vocalsound},Marketing
6782,12,You have to choose {disfmarker},Project Manager
6783,12,"Yeah , that's true . But {disfmarker}",User Interface
6784,12,"No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6785,12,Is it {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager
6786,12,"Yeah ,",Marketing
6787,12,I I know {disfmarker} I dunno . Is {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6788,12,but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?,Marketing
6789,12,"Yeah , it can .",User Interface
6790,12,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
6791,12,'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .,User Interface
6792,12,You {disfmarker},Marketing
6793,12,Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .,Industrial Designer
6794,12,"Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just {disfmarker} No , just some LED .",Project Manager
6795,12,I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .,User Interface
6796,12,I think it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6797,12,And I can change the colour of it .,User Interface
6798,12,"Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .",Project Manager
6799,12,"Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it {disfmarker} I th I don't think so .",Industrial Designer
6800,12,"Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So {disfmarker}",User Interface
6801,12,Hmm .,Marketing
6802,12,Then uh some more technical things .,Industrial Designer
6803,12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6804,12,"I don't know what it is , but it should be there {vocalsound} I think .",Industrial Designer
6805,12,{vocalsound},Marketing
6806,12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
6807,12,{vocalsound},User Interface
6808,12,"Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .",Industrial Designer
6809,12,"Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager
6810,12,W {vocalsound} So we d we just need this and {vocalsound} this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .,Industrial Designer
6811,12,{vocalsound},User Interface
6812,12,Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .,Industrial Designer
6813,12,I'm sure we can fit in .,User Interface
6814,12,So I guess we j we just need that .,Industrial Designer
6815,12,{gap},Marketing
6816,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6817,12,I don't know what they do or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6818,12,Yeah okay .,User Interface
6819,12,"Okay yeah ,",Marketing
6820,12,We just {disfmarker},User Interface
6821,12,you can you can change {disfmarker} Yeah . No .,Marketing
6822,12,"Nah , but they just said we need it .",Industrial Designer
6823,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6824,12,"Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .",Industrial Designer
6825,12,"Yeah , a recharger maybe .",Project Manager
6826,12,"Yeah , we have to make sure to uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
6827,12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer
6828,12,"We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?",Project Manager
6829,12,Yeah but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6830,12,Is that still the {disfmarker},Project Manager
6831,12,Yes . Yes .,User Interface
6832,12,"Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Accu .",Industrial Designer
6833,12,A recha Oh no . Uh {disfmarker} Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .,Project Manager
6834,12,Re recharger . Base station .,User Interface
6835,12,"Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .",Industrial Designer
6836,12,"Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .",User Interface
6837,12,Okay . Not a separate {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6838,12,"No , just rechargeable batteries .",Project Manager
6839,12,"Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one .",Industrial Designer
6840,12,{gap},Project Manager
6841,12,Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh {disfmarker} Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .,Industrial Designer
6842,12,Ah cool . Okay .,Marketing
6843,12,But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .,Project Manager
6844,12,"So if you hold it , it gets powered .",User Interface
6845,12,"If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and {disfmarker} Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,",Industrial Designer
6846,12,It's dark in the room . No .,Project Manager
6847,12,{gap},User Interface
6848,12,"It's just batteries ,",Project Manager
6849,12,so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6850,12,{vocalsound},Marketing
6851,12,that's cheaper {gap} .,Project Manager
6852,12,"Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .",Industrial Designer
6853,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6854,12,"Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .",Industrial Designer
6855,12,Okay .,Marketing
6856,12,"So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .",Industrial Designer
6857,12,Mm . So,User Interface
6858,12,So we can't use the flat buttons .,Industrial Designer
6859,12,we need uh two D_ .,User Interface
6860,12,Yeah . Definitely .,Project Manager
6861,12,"Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used .",Industrial Designer
6862,12,"But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .",Project Manager
6863,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6864,12,"Yeah , I think so too .",Industrial Designer
6865,12,"The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume .",Project Manager
6866,12,"Yeah , scroll wheels um {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6867,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6868,12,"Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .",Industrial Designer
6869,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6870,12,But I think just the volume is enough .,Industrial Designer
6871,12,"{gap} Uh {disfmarker} For channels it's not handy ,",User Interface
6872,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6873,12,because you scroll too fast .,User Interface
6874,12,"And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .",Industrial Designer
6875,12,Mm {disfmarker},Marketing
6876,12,I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .,Project Manager
6877,12,"Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels .",Industrial Designer
6878,12,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager
6879,12,Okay .,User Interface
6880,12,"And um {disfmarker} Yeah , that was it I guess .",Industrial Designer
6881,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6882,12,"Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6883,12,Oh just sk,Project Manager
6884,12,We haven't decided yet .,Industrial Designer
6885,12,Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's {disfmarker},Project Manager
6886,12,Uh I don't think a rubber case looks {disfmarker},User Interface
6887,12,L,Industrial Designer
6888,12,Uh but we have to do something about the trend .,Marketing
6889,12,"Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?",Industrial Designer
6890,12,The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .,Marketing
6891,12,"Yeah , okay . That {disfmarker} Uh fruit and veg , or {disfmarker}",User Interface
6892,12,And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .,Marketing
6893,12,"Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .",User Interface
6894,12,Uh yeah i Just {disfmarker} Just on front .,Marketing
6895,12,"So you can {gap} the the spongy {disfmarker} yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control .",User Interface
6896,12,No .,Project Manager
6897,12,Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .,Marketing
6898,12,No . {gap} {vocalsound},Project Manager
6899,12,I just can't imagine it .,User Interface
6900,12,{vocalsound} So just hard plastic ?,Industrial Designer
6901,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
6902,12,"Yeah , I think .",User Interface
6903,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6904,12,Titanium . It's mentioned here uh .,User Interface
6905,12,"Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .",Industrial Designer
6906,12,But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit,Project Manager
6907,12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer
6908,12,more rounded .,Project Manager
6909,12,"you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth .",Industrial Designer
6910,12,"Yeah . Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
6911,12,Okay .,User Interface
6912,12,So {disfmarker} We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger .,Project Manager
6913,12,{gap},User Interface
6914,12,We already know that . Just a normal battery .,Project Manager
6915,12,Yeah . We have batteries .,User Interface
6916,12,Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one .,Project Manager
6917,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6918,12,Regular .,User Interface
6919,12,"Okay , the case is just a plastic one .",Project Manager
6920,12,"Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .",Industrial Designer
6921,12,"Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular .",Project Manager
6922,12,"You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second .",Industrial Designer
6923,12,Okay .,Project Manager
6924,12,I think I'll just check it .,Industrial Designer
6925,12,"And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . {gap}",Project Manager
6926,12,Yes .,User Interface
6927,12,That's pretty much it .,Project Manager
6928,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6929,12,And a flashy light .,Project Manager
6930,12,User interface concept .,User Interface
6931,12,So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But {gap},Project Manager
6932,12,I dunno either .,User Interface
6933,12,Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?,Industrial Designer
6934,12,Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .,User Interface
6935,12,Yeah . That's for the next one .,Project Manager
6936,12,So we should did it here ?,Industrial Designer
6937,12,That's for th,Project Manager
6938,12,So we're staying here ?,User Interface
6939,12,Uh that {disfmarker} I think that's the next next meeting .,Project Manager
6940,12,Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Okay .,Industrial Designer
6941,12,But you definitely get a specific instruction . {vocalsound},Project Manager
6942,12,"Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?",User Interface
6943,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6944,12,But th think about something that's more rounded . Just {disfmarker} And more {disfmarker} It has to be {disfmarker},Project Manager
6945,12,"Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .",User Interface
6946,12,Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom .,Project Manager
6947,12,"Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .",User Interface
6948,12,"Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a {disfmarker} What the fuck is it ? {vocalsound} Okay . Mm {disfmarker} Doesn't work . {vocalsound} You see what I mean ?",Project Manager
6949,12,{vocalsound} What ?,Industrial Designer
6950,12,If I draw here {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It draws about four centimetres lower than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
6951,12,Oh . Okay .,Industrial Designer
6952,12,"Nah okay . Just {gap} . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um {disfmarker} It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .",Project Manager
6953,12,Like a very big scroll-wheel . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
6954,12,"Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .",Project Manager
6955,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
6956,12,"Maybe , I dunno .",Project Manager
6957,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
6958,12,"Okay , so we {vocalsound} have this at the moment .",Project Manager
6959,12,I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .,Industrial Designer
6960,12,"Yeah , you {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface
6961,12,"Okay , so",Project Manager
6962,12,Yeah .,User Interface
6963,12,we'd have this . Is that okay ?,Project Manager
6964,12,"Yeah ,",User Interface
6965,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
6966,12,"that's a little problem , of course , as well .",User Interface
6967,12,I think it's probably better .,Industrial Designer
6968,12,And {disfmarker},Project Manager
6969,12,"Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger .",Industrial Designer
6970,12,"Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh {disfmarker} That's not scrollable too easy .",User Interface
6971,12,Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom,Project Manager
6972,12,I think in middle .,Industrial Designer
6973,12,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
6974,12,Uh wh what is the middle part ?,User Interface
6975,12,That's the numbers .,Project Manager
6976,12,"Numbers , okay .",User Interface
6977,12,"Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .",Industrial Designer
6978,12,"Yeah , I agree as well .",User Interface
6979,12,"It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .",Project Manager
6980,12,Use the dz,User Interface
6981,12,"Because you already have the volume here , so {disfmarker} You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . {gap} back and forth .",Project Manager
6982,12,"Yeah , that's right .",User Interface
6983,12,"So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well .",Project Manager
6984,12,Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .,Industrial Designer
6985,12,"But that's not {gap} want to zap very quick , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager
6986,12,"Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority .",User Interface
6987,12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
6988,12,"Yeah ? Is this a opportunity ,",Project Manager
6989,12,And then you use those uh {disfmarker},User Interface
6990,12,or you don't want a different {disfmarker},Project Manager
6991,12,"Yeah , of course uh .",User Interface
6992,12,"Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6993,12,Why ?,Project Manager
6994,12,Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
6995,12,But still the next {disfmarker} It's still the next one . Doesn't make {disfmarker},Project Manager
6996,12,"Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you put them {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
6997,12,"Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference .",Project Manager
6998,12,"Yeah . I I think it's {disfmarker} It's it's obvious , I think .",User Interface
6999,12,"But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .",Industrial Designer
7000,12,"Yeah , that's not not {disfmarker} It's not al uh always the same .",Marketing
7001,12,But it's exactly th,Project Manager
7002,12,In uh {disfmarker} On most on most remote controls .,Industrial Designer
7003,12,Every remote control's uh different .,Marketing
7004,12,"Yeah , I think {disfmarker}",User Interface
7005,12,"So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .",Industrial Designer
7006,12,"I dunno . I {disfmarker} You already have the volume on the side ,",Project Manager
7007,12,"No , uh I think {disfmarker}",User Interface
7008,12,so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake .,Project Manager
7009,12,Yeah .,User Interface
7010,12,So it's uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
7011,12,I think it's s so simple,User Interface
7012,12,I dunno .,Industrial Designer
7013,12,you just {disfmarker},User Interface
7014,12,"So but that's for that's for you ,",Project Manager
7015,12,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7016,12,'cause it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
7017,12,"Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .",User Interface
7018,12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7019,12,"Okay , so hmm . What did {disfmarker} What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno .",Project Manager
7020,12,Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?,User Interface
7021,12,"Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .",Marketing
7022,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
7023,12,'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .,Marketing
7024,12,And the LED .,Project Manager
7025,12,"No , you have uh {disfmarker} It is {disfmarker}",User Interface
7026,12,"Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .",Industrial Designer
7027,12,Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic .,User Interface
7028,12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7029,12,You have to look at that image of the iPod .,User Interface
7030,12,Yes . Okay .,Marketing
7031,12,More that uh kind of style .,User Interface
7032,12,And a bit uh {disfmarker},Marketing
7033,12,Not not the old grey black {disfmarker},User Interface
7034,12,Uh {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager
7035,12,Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have {disfmarker},Marketing
7036,12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7037,12,Where you can put a ve Uh we have {disfmarker} If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .,User Interface
7038,12,"Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager
7039,12,Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ?,Marketing
7040,12,"Yeah , five . Let's give five .",Project Manager
7041,12,{gap},User Interface
7042,12,Or more or {disfmarker},Marketing
7043,12,Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7044,12,"And um uh {vocalsound} uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .",Marketing
7045,12,Yeah . Um,User Interface
7046,12,Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .,Marketing
7047,12,"I think {disfmarker} Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh .",User Interface
7048,12,"No , tha that will be {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
7049,12,So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?,Project Manager
7050,12,Yes .,User Interface
7051,12,"So you could put it like that ,",Project Manager
7052,12,"Yeah , so top down .",Industrial Designer
7053,12,okay .,Project Manager
7054,12,Hmm ?,Industrial Designer
7055,12,"Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .",Marketing
7056,12,Do we have to design that w as well ?,Industrial Designer
7057,12,Yeah . {vocalsound},Marketing
7058,12,Uh I'm not sure .,Project Manager
7059,12,The docking station ?,Industrial Designer
7060,12,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface
7061,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
7062,12,"But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least .",User Interface
7063,12,"Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .",Marketing
7064,12,"Yeah , just a recharger .",Industrial Designer
7065,12,"Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example .",User Interface
7066,12,But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .,Industrial Designer
7067,12,Mm . Mm .,User Interface
7068,12,"Yeah ,",Marketing
7069,12,Which w,User Interface
7070,12,but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then .,Marketing
7071,12,Here you see one that's very round .,User Interface
7072,12,"Oh yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer
7073,12,So I think that can be all kind of shapes .,User Interface
7074,12,But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all .,Project Manager
7075,12,Of the remote control ?,Industrial Designer
7076,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
7077,12,Yeah .,Marketing
7078,12,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7079,12,Just round it up {gap} .,Project Manager
7080,12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7081,12,"Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod {gap} . But {disfmarker}",User Interface
7082,12,No . Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
7083,12,"More rounded . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's {disfmarker} This is also rounded .",User Interface
7084,12,"No , just just the corners .",Project Manager
7085,12,I think i,User Interface
7086,12,{gap},Marketing
7087,12,"Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface
7088,12,Okay .,Project Manager
7089,12,"Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh {disfmarker} As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .",Industrial Designer
7090,12,Shapes .,Project Manager
7091,12,"Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new .",User Interface
7092,12,"Not in depth . Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new .",Industrial Designer
7093,12,I've uh {disfmarker} I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done .,User Interface
7094,12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7095,12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7096,12,"It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?",Project Manager
7097,12,Yeah . What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square .,Marketing
7098,12,"Yeah okay , yeah well {disfmarker}",User Interface
7099,12,Okay .,Marketing
7100,12,"Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
7101,12,"Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but {disfmarker}",User Interface
7102,12,"Yeah , it {disfmarker}",Marketing
7103,12,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7104,12,Like in this kind of shape or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7105,12,Uh it's very annoying . Okay .,Marketing
7106,12,I dunno . I dunno if it's handy .,Industrial Designer
7107,12,{gap} I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .,User Interface
7108,12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
7109,12,This ?,Industrial Designer

7156,12,"Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .",Industrial Designer
7157,12,"There is one {disfmarker} There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different {disfmarker}",Marketing
7158,12,"Yeah , {gap} idea . But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker}",User Interface
7159,12,But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy .,Project Manager
7160,12,And if you make it look like the iPod {disfmarker},User Interface
7161,12,"Yeah , they're all the same .",Marketing
7162,12,Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change,User Interface
7163,12,Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the {vocalsound} wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .,Project Manager
7164,12,compared to {disfmarker},User Interface
7165,12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer

7171,12,"No , I think {disfmarker} Oh .",User Interface
7172,12,It's right .,Project Manager

7174,12,Yeah .,Project Manager
7175,12,So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much .,User Interface
7176,12,Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has {vocalsound} if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . So maybe you have to ask her .,Project Manager
7177,12,"Yeah okay . Well ,",User Interface
7178,12,No .,Marketing
7179,12,"maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .",User Interface

7393,13,"But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .",Industrial Designer
7394,13,y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .,User Interface
7395,13,So that's the point .,Industrial Designer
7396,13,Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker},User Interface
7397,13,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7398,13,{vocalsound},Marketing
7399,13,you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .,User Interface
7400,13,"Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss",Industrial Designer
7401,13,Yeah .,User Interface
7402,13,"and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,",Industrial Designer
7403,13,Yeah .,Project Manager
7404,13,but take these things into account when you start the discussion .,Industrial Designer
7405,13,"Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,",Project Manager
7406,13,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer
7407,13,and {disfmarker},Project Manager
7408,13,"so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,",Industrial Designer
7409,13,"Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7410,13,and the way of communicating with these equipments .,Industrial Designer
7411,13,"Okay . Okay , good .",Project Manager
7412,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7413,13,"Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .",Project Manager
7414,13,That's it .,Industrial Designer
7415,13,Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .,Project Manager
7416,13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7417,13,"Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .",Project Manager
7418,13,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
7419,13,H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?,Project Manager
7420,13,"Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?",User Interface
7421,13,Yep .,Project Manager
7422,13,{vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .,User Interface
7423,13,"Yes , I think it should be something like that .",Industrial Designer
7424,13,"It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,",User Interface
7425,13,"Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,",Project Manager
7426,13,right ?,User Interface
7427,13,not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker},Project Manager
7428,13,"Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .",User Interface
7429,13,"We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?",Industrial Designer
7430,13,No . No .,Project Manager
7431,13,"No ,",Industrial Designer
7432,13,"No , okay .",User Interface
7433,13,"we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .",Industrial Designer
7434,13,Yeah .,Project Manager
7435,13,Yeah .,User Interface
7436,13,"Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?",Project Manager
7437,13,"Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .",Marketing
7438,13,Okay . Okay .,Project Manager
7439,13,"{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .",User Interface
7440,13,Yeah .,Project Manager
7441,13,So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker},User Interface
7442,13,So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker},Project Manager
7443,13,Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7444,13,"Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .",User Interface
7445,13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7446,13,It just should change the T_V_'s state .,User Interface
7447,13,Okay .,Project Manager
7448,13,So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker},User Interface
7449,13,And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?,Industrial Designer
7450,13,"Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .",User Interface
7451,13,Or are there any o other controls ?,Industrial Designer
7452,13,"Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}",User Interface
7453,13,"Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
7454,13,But {disfmarker},User Interface
7455,13,"I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .",Industrial Designer
7456,13,Yeah .,User Interface
7457,13,Uh-huh .,Project Manager
7458,13,You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7459,13,They're very vu vulnerable .,User Interface
7460,13,"w yes ,",Industrial Designer
7461,13,Yeah .,User Interface
7462,13,"to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,",Industrial Designer
7463,13,Yeah .,User Interface
7464,13,I don't know .,Industrial Designer
7465,13,"And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,",User Interface
7466,13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7467,13,"so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}",User Interface
7468,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7469,13,Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .,Project Manager
7470,13,"Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .",User Interface
7471,13,Okay,Project Manager
7472,13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7473,13,{disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
7474,13,"Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .",Industrial Designer
7475,13,"Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,",User Interface
7476,13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7477,13,"but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface
7478,13,Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7479,13,"Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting",Project Manager
7480,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7481,13,But {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface
7482,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7483,13,um {disfmarker},Project Manager
7484,13,Two more things .,User Interface
7485,13,okay .,Project Manager
7486,13,"Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .",User Interface
7487,13,"Okay , s yeah .",Project Manager
7488,13,"You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .",User Interface
7489,13,Yeah .,Project Manager
7490,13,"And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too .",User Interface
7491,13,Okay .,Project Manager
7492,13,So when it's dark {disfmarker},User Interface
7493,13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7494,13,Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker},User Interface
7495,13,Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha {vocalsound},Project Manager
7496,13,Yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect . {vocalsound},User Interface
7497,13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7498,13,Okay .,Project Manager
7499,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7500,13,"Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .",Project Manager
7501,13,Do do you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7502,13,Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?,Project Manager
7503,13,"Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .",Marketing
7504,13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
7505,13,"And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .",Marketing
7506,13,Because ?,Project Manager
7507,13,"Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .",Marketing
7508,13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
7509,13,But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that .,Marketing
7510,13,"Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?",Project Manager
7511,13,"Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,",Industrial Designer
7512,13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7513,13,{vocalsound},User Interface
7514,13,"but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them . Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .",Industrial Designer
7515,13,Yeah .,User Interface
7516,13,"Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it .",Industrial Designer
7517,13,"Yeah . Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple ,",User Interface
7518,13,I I don't know .,Industrial Designer
7519,13,you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .,User Interface
7520,13,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer
7521,13,The uh the the digits in black .,User Interface
7522,13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7523,13,Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy,User Interface
7524,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7525,13,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7526,13,"{disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course .",User Interface
7527,13,Okay .,Project Manager
7528,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7529,13,"Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7530,13,"Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .",Industrial Designer
7531,13,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
7532,13,"Well , that's more {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
7533,13,"twelve Euro fifty , yeah .",Project Manager
7534,13,Yeah .,Marketing
7535,13,"So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .",Industrial Designer
7536,13,Okay .,Project Manager
7537,13,The cost price is very low .,Industrial Designer
7538,13,Just remind something .,User Interface
7539,13,Um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7540,13,The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .,User Interface
7541,13,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager
7542,13,You have a m uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7543,13,Okay . Very good point . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
7544,13,"Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .",User Interface
7545,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7546,13,"Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily",Project Manager
7547,13,Mm-hmm . Okay .,Industrial Designer
7548,13,um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .,Project Manager
7549,13,Yeah .,User Interface
7550,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7551,13,{vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker},Project Manager
7552,13,"But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah .",User Interface
7553,13,"yeah . I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7554,13,Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .,User Interface
7555,13,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
7556,13,'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7557,13,{vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7558,13,Well does it ?,Project Manager
7559,13,"Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .",User Interface
7560,13,well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7561,13,I'm not sure . Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
7562,13,"Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay .",Industrial Designer
7563,13,Yeah .,Project Manager
7564,13,So uh technically it will be possible .,Industrial Designer
7565,13,"But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .",User Interface
7566,13,"Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .",Project Manager
7567,13,Does it {disfmarker},User Interface
7568,13,"No , you cannot .",Industrial Designer
7569,13,{vocalsound} It's over ?,User Interface
7570,13,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
7571,13,{vocalsound},Marketing
7572,13,Um,Project Manager
7573,13,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7574,13,"{vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it .",Project Manager
7575,13,Okay .,User Interface
7576,13,See you in thirty minutes .,Project Manager
7577,13,Great .,User Interface
7578,14,Welcome back .,Project Manager

7585,14,The waiting is for Sebastian .,Project Manager
7586,14,{gap} .,User Interface
7587,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7588,14,There he is .,Project Manager
7589,14,{vocalsound} Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer
7590,14,We have a slight problem . {vocalsound} I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .,User Interface
7591,14,Sorry ?,Project Manager
7592,14,{vocalsound} Can I get a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer
7593,14,"Uh no . You can't ,",Project Manager
7594,14,Okay . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7595,14,sorry .,Project Manager
7596,14,So just cancel it .,User Interface
7597,14,"{gap} Well , during my work I have no time either .",Industrial Designer
7598,14,"{vocalsound} Well ,",Project Manager
7599,14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7600,14,"this is life . {vocalsound} Sorry uh , Roo .",Project Manager
7601,14,"Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . {vocalsound} Accidentally .",User Interface
7602,14,"Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .",Project Manager
7603,14,But it's alright .,User Interface
7604,14,"{vocalsound} Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it .",Project Manager
7605,14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
7606,14,"Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?",Project Manager
7607,14,I think so too .,Industrial Designer
7608,14,Roo ?,Project Manager
7609,14,Yeah . {vocalsound},User Interface
7610,14,Ruud ?,Project Manager
7611,14,Almost . {vocalsound},Marketing
7612,14,"Almost , okay .",Project Manager
7613,14,{vocalsound},User Interface
7614,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7615,14,Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m,Project Manager
7616,14,"But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .",User Interface
7617,14,{vocalsound} Um we will figure that out . Ca {vocalsound} can you try to {disfmarker},Project Manager
7618,14,Okay .,User Interface
7619,14,Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the {gap} .,Marketing
7620,14,"Yeah , w we will see .",Project Manager
7621,14,I don't think it's wireless here .,User Interface
7622,14,"Um {disfmarker} it is , yeah . Yeah .",Project Manager
7623,14,It is .,Industrial Designer
7624,14,Or it is . Yeah ?,User Interface
7625,14,It is .,Industrial Designer
7626,14,"Okay , great .",User Interface
7627,14,Uh okay .,Marketing
7628,14,"Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um {vocalsound} we have forty minutes . So it's now {disfmarker} Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . {vocalsound} It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w",Project Manager
7629,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7630,14,uh uh {disfmarker} we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .,Project Manager
7631,14,"Time , yeah .",User Interface
7632,14,"Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , {vocalsound} which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um {vocalsound} then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .",Project Manager
7633,14,Yes .,User Interface
7634,14,"Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?",Project Manager
7635,14,"Yeah , I'll start .",User Interface
7636,14,"Uh uh yeah . Okay ,",Project Manager
7637,14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
7638,14,great .,Project Manager
7639,14,"Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .",User Interface
7640,14,{vocalsound},Project Manager
7641,14,Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .,User Interface
7642,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7643,14,"Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .",User Interface
7644,14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
7645,14,And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .,User Interface
7646,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7647,14,"{vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .",User Interface
7648,14,Uh-huh .,Project Manager
7649,14,"So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .",User Interface
7650,14,"Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?",Project Manager
7651,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7652,14,"Yeah , uh b uh most .",Marketing
7653,14,"Okay , so",Project Manager
7654,14,{vocalsound},Marketing
7655,14,the important thing here is {disfmarker},Project Manager
7656,14,{vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .,User Interface
7657,14,"Oh , user-friendly .",Marketing
7658,14,"In the market , yeah .",Project Manager
7659,14,"Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .",User Interface
7660,14,"Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7661,14,Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .,User Interface
7662,14,Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .,Project Manager
7663,14,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7664,14,{vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound},User Interface
7665,14,"Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .",Industrial Designer
7666,14,{vocalsound},User Interface
7667,14,"Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,",Industrial Designer
7668,14,Energies and uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7669,14,but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?,Industrial Designer
7670,14,"No , it's not visible .",Project Manager
7671,14,"No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .",Industrial Designer
7672,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7673,14,"There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w",Industrial Designer
7674,14,The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .,User Interface
7675,14,yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7676,14,Yeah . Okay .,Project Manager
7677,14,"Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .",Industrial Designer
7678,14,So it's fairly easy .,Project Manager
7679,14,"There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,",Industrial Designer
7680,14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
7681,14,{vocalsound} Succeed in it also .,User Interface
7682,14,and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .,Industrial Designer
7683,14,{vocalsound},Marketing
7684,14,"Okay ,",Project Manager
7685,14,"So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh",Industrial Designer
7686,14,good .,Project Manager
7687,14,"personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear .",Industrial Designer
7688,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7689,14,"Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .",Industrial Designer
7690,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7691,14,"And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .",Industrial Designer
7692,14,{vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker},User Interface
7693,14,I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .,Industrial Designer
7694,14,"if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}",User Interface
7695,14,"No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .",Industrial Designer
7696,14,Okay .,User Interface
7697,14,So we can use them . So that's no problem .,Industrial Designer
7698,14,"For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker}",User Interface
7699,14,"Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
7700,14,Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7701,14,We can we can make its I think .,Industrial Designer
7702,14,"Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .",Marketing
7703,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7704,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7705,14,"Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .",Project Manager
7706,14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing
7707,14,Okay .,Industrial Designer
7708,14,But I think {disfmarker},User Interface
7709,14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
7710,14,"Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,",User Interface
7711,14,"Hmm , true . {vocalsound}",Marketing
7712,14,and not for {disfmarker},User Interface
7713,14,"Yes . Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .",Industrial Designer
7714,14,"Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .",User Interface
7715,14,"No no no , no . That's right , that's right .",Industrial Designer
7716,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7717,14,"So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it .",Industrial Designer
7718,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7719,14,{vocalsound} Um have a think about it .,Industrial Designer
7720,14,"Yeah . Okay , Ruud .",Project Manager
7721,14,"Oh , mine is already outdated .",Marketing
7722,14,"Okay well ,",Project Manager
7723,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7724,14,we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .,Project Manager
7725,14,{vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker},Marketing
7726,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7727,14,So any income is welcome . {vocalsound} Input .,Project Manager
7728,14,"Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .",Marketing
7729,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7730,14,"Could you step a little bit more to the right ? {vocalsound} Yeah , thank you . {vocalsound}",User Interface
7731,14,"But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .",Marketing
7732,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7733,14,"Uh well , skip this . {vocalsound}",Marketing
7734,14,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7735,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7736,14,"Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .",Marketing
7737,14,Mm .,Industrial Designer
7738,14,So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .,Marketing
7739,14,"Okay . Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager
7740,14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing
7741,14,"Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function ,",Industrial Designer
7742,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7743,14,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
7744,14,you know .,Industrial Designer
7745,14,that's definitely interesting .,Project Manager
7746,14,That's quite a {disfmarker} yes .,Industrial Designer
7747,14,It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .,Project Manager
7748,14,Sound signal .,User Interface
7749,14,Yeah .,Marketing
7750,14,"Okay ,",Project Manager
7751,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7752,14,go on .,Project Manager
7753,14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
7754,14,"Well , I just said that . And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it .",Marketing
7755,14,Okay . So that's what the market tells us .,Project Manager
7756,14,"Uh that's about it , yes .",Marketing
7757,14,Yep . Okay .,Project Manager
7758,14,The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .,User Interface
7759,14,Uh mo uh zap buttons most .,Marketing
7760,14,So {disfmarker},User Interface
7761,14,"Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So {disfmarker}",Marketing
7762,14,"Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons . And first um {disfmarker}",User Interface
7763,14,"Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .",Industrial Designer
7764,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7765,14,Yep .,Project Manager
7766,14,"Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .",Industrial Designer
7767,14,"Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?",User Interface
7768,14,Well,Industrial Designer
7769,14,"Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem . Yeah . {vocalsound}",Marketing
7770,14,Yes . {vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem .,Industrial Designer
7771,14,{vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .,User Interface
7772,14,Well,Project Manager
7773,14,Usually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7774,14,"maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",Project Manager
7775,14,It should be uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7776,14,like um turning on and off the the the lights .,Project Manager
7777,14,Oh yes .,Industrial Designer
7778,14,"Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .",User Interface
7779,14,"Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .",Industrial Designer
7780,14,Reports rep respend response to it .,Project Manager
7781,14,And um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7782,14,"just like uh the phones Yeah ,",User Interface
7783,14,"Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .",Industrial Designer
7784,14,the {disfmarker},User Interface
7785,14,Yeah .,Marketing
7786,14,But uh th,Project Manager
7787,14,But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7788,14,"No , so we we should use something else .",Industrial Designer
7789,14,And you {disfmarker},Marketing
7790,14,"Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7791,14,But I believe you will have an {disfmarker},User Interface
7792,14,"Yeah , and usually {disfmarker}",Marketing
7793,14,We do not control the T_V_ set so well .,Industrial Designer
7794,14,"And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,",Marketing
7795,14,"Yes , m yes . S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers ,",Industrial Designer
7796,14,and it's {disfmarker},Marketing
7797,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7798,14,so we should think about {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7799,14,So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se,Project Manager
7800,14,I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .,User Interface
7801,14,"{vocalsound} It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .",Industrial Designer
7802,14,{vocalsound} And b,Marketing
7803,14,"Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7804,14,"Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,",Industrial Designer
7805,14,"Yeah , a peak . Yeah .",Project Manager
7806,14,which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .,Industrial Designer
7807,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7808,14,But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .,Industrial Designer
7809,14,"So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .",Marketing
7810,14,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager
7811,14,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer
7812,14,But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .,User Interface
7813,14,so we don't want that .,Industrial Designer
7814,14,{vocalsound},Marketing
7815,14,Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that .,Industrial Designer
7816,14,Well if you lost th,User Interface
7817,14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer
7818,14,Well uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
7819,14,is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7820,14,I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .,User Interface
7821,14,"Well , I don't think uh {gap} .",Industrial Designer
7822,14,Uh that's just uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7823,14,"No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,",Industrial Designer
7824,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7825,14,"so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .",Industrial Designer
7826,14,{gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .,User Interface
7827,14,"Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .",Industrial Designer
7828,14,"Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .",Project Manager
7829,14,So that's not a good idea .,Industrial Designer
7830,14,Yeah .,Marketing
7831,14,"Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,",Project Manager
7832,14,Mm-hmm . I will .,Industrial Designer
7833,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7834,14,because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .,Project Manager
7835,14,Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated,Industrial Designer
7836,14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
7837,14,um and it will become more costly also .,Industrial Designer
7838,14,Yep .,Project Manager
7839,14,Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp,Industrial Designer
7840,14,"And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?",User Interface
7841,14,"Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .",Industrial Designer
7842,14,It's a unique item uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7843,14,"Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .",Project Manager
7844,14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7845,14,It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .,User Interface
7846,14,"It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,",Project Manager
7847,14,Yeah .,Marketing
7848,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7849,14,and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .,Project Manager
7850,14,"And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .",User Interface
7851,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7852,14,What should we choose in in design ?,User Interface
7853,14,"Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .",Project Manager
7854,14,"Well , the extra functions .",User Interface
7855,14,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
7856,14,I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .,Marketing
7857,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7858,14,"Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .",Marketing
7859,14,Used option .,User Interface
7860,14,Okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7861,14,{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7862,14,"Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
7863,14,{vocalsound},Marketing
7864,14,{vocalsound},User Interface
7865,14,"Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .",Marketing
7866,14,"Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .",Project Manager
7867,14,So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .,Marketing
7868,14,"Well , we skip that .",Project Manager
7869,14,So {disfmarker},Marketing
7870,14,Okay .,Project Manager
7871,14,"Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .",User Interface
7872,14,"No , no .",Industrial Designer
7873,14,No .,Project Manager
7874,14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
7875,14,Nope .,Marketing
7876,14,So that's out of the question .,Industrial Designer
7877,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7878,14,Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .,User Interface
7879,14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7880,14,Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .,Project Manager
7881,14,"I think also . Yes . Well ,",Industrial Designer
7882,14,No .,Project Manager
7883,14,So {disfmarker},User Interface
7884,14,we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface,Industrial Designer
7885,14,"Yeah . Okay ,",Project Manager
7886,14,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
7887,14,"Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7888,14,"Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might ,",Marketing
7889,14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
7890,14,'cause young people uh like new features .,Marketing
7891,14,Mm yeah .,Project Manager
7892,14,So {disfmarker},Marketing
7893,14,"Yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer
7894,14,"Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7895,14,Mm .,Industrial Designer
7896,14,"Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .",User Interface
7897,14,"Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .",Industrial Designer
7898,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7899,14,"Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
7900,14,"But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh",Project Manager
7901,14,"Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .",Industrial Designer
7902,14,But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?,Project Manager
7903,14,"Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound}",User Interface
7904,14,Because we do not implement uh a user history .,Project Manager
7905,14,"Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .",Industrial Designer
7906,14,"I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7907,14,"W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .",Industrial Designer
7908,14,"And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .",Marketing
7909,14,Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .,Project Manager
7910,14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
7911,14,"But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,",User Interface
7912,14,"Yeah , draw draw it on the board .",Project Manager
7913,14,"should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh .",User Interface
7914,14,"yeah , something like that . Oh",Industrial Designer
7915,14,It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .,User Interface
7916,14,"It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes .",Industrial Designer
7917,14,A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down,User Interface
7918,14,"Yeah , it can break down .",Project Manager
7919,14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer
7920,14,or uh,User Interface
7921,14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer
7922,14,"just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .",User Interface
7923,14,Yeah .,Marketing
7924,14,"And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .",Industrial Designer
7925,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7926,14,"I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .",Industrial Designer
7927,14,A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh .,Marketing
7928,14,But you're the marketing man .,Industrial Designer
7929,14,"And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .",Marketing
7930,14,"Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound}",User Interface
7931,14,Uh-huh . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7932,14,The programme up and down . {vocalsound},User Interface
7933,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7934,14,{vocalsound},Marketing
7935,14,"Okay , yeah .",Project Manager
7936,14,"And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .",User Interface
7937,14,"Okay , that's good .",Industrial Designer
7938,14,"Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .",Project Manager
7939,14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7940,14,"But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think .",User Interface
7941,14,"Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah .",Project Manager
7942,14,Yes ?,User Interface
7943,14,We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience .,Project Manager
7944,14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
7945,14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer
7946,14,"but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay ,",User Interface
7947,14,Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?,Industrial Designer
7948,14,"Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .",Project Manager
7949,14,Okay . Okay .,Industrial Designer
7950,14,The ten digits .,User Interface
7951,14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
7952,14,"Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7953,14,"Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change",User Interface
7954,14,Mm-hmm . Yes .,Industrial Designer
7955,14,Yeah . A bit of a split mode .,Project Manager
7956,14,Change .,Industrial Designer
7957,14,Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager
7958,14,{disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface
7959,14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer
7960,14,Dual channel watch .,Project Manager
7961,14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
7962,14,"Okay , well um",Project Manager
7963,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7964,14,m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7965,14,{vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7966,14,{vocalsound},User Interface
7967,14,you're the secretary . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7968,14,"Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?",Project Manager
7969,14,Mielsen .,Marketing
7970,14,"Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7971,14,"Mm okay ,",Industrial Designer
7972,14,Alright .,User Interface
7973,14,"but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
7974,14,"Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7975,14,Yeah .,Marketing
7976,14,"if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound}",Project Manager
7977,14,{vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker},User Interface
7978,14,{vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
7979,14,"Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager
7980,14,{vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker},User Interface
7981,14,Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
7982,14,"Yes , that's important .",Industrial Designer
7983,14,And and do we want um the ten digits ?,Project Manager
7984,14,"The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .",User Interface
7985,14,"Well , are are you sure ?",Industrial Designer
7986,14,"Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .",Marketing
7987,14,I'm not so sure .,Industrial Designer
7988,14,Yeah .,User Interface
7989,14,"Well , that's complicated ,",Industrial Designer
7990,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
7991,14,but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so .,Industrial Designer
7992,14,I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits .,User Interface
7993,14,"Okay ,",Industrial Designer
7994,14,Uh and I think the most {disfmarker},User Interface
7995,14,I can imagine when,Industrial Designer
7996,14,I agree actually . {vocalsound},Project Manager
7997,14,"Just elder elder people would would buy it ,",User Interface
7998,14,"I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .",Industrial Designer
7999,14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing
8000,14,but {disfmarker},User Interface
8001,14,"But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .",Industrial Designer
8002,14,But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .,Project Manager
8003,14,But {disfmarker},Marketing
8004,14,Yep . The older people only use five of them .,User Interface
8005,14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer
8006,14,"Yeah ,",Marketing
8007,14,but how how often do you watch all these channels ?,Industrial Designer
8008,14,"and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .",Marketing
8009,14,Often .,Project Manager
8010,14,"No , you're probably right .",Industrial Designer
8011,14,So {disfmarker},Marketing
8012,14,Yeah .,User Interface
8013,14,Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?,Industrial Designer
8014,14,"Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8015,14,The design .,Industrial Designer
8016,14,On the design .,User Interface
8017,14,"Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it .",Industrial Designer
8018,14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing
8019,14,You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy,Project Manager
8020,14,And {disfmarker},Marketing
8021,14,"by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .",Project Manager
8022,14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
8023,14,So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker},Project Manager
8024,14,Yeah .,User Interface
8025,14,"Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .",Industrial Designer
8026,14,"Exactly , exactly .",Project Manager
8027,14,Okay .,Industrial Designer
8028,14,"And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker}",Marketing
8029,14,"Okay , speech .",Project Manager
8030,14,"Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .",Industrial Designer
8031,14,Yeah .,User Interface
8032,14,"So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .",Industrial Designer
8033,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
8034,14,And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .,Industrial Designer
8035,14,To find {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
8036,14,"So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .",Industrial Designer
8037,14,Yeah .,Marketing
8038,14,Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits,Project Manager
8039,14,But maybe when we uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8040,14,"but keep the programme and the volume ,",Project Manager
8041,14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
8042,14,"because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8043,14,"Okay . Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer
8044,14,Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but,Marketing
8045,14,Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .,Project Manager
8046,14,Okay .,Industrial Designer
8047,14,Yes .,Marketing
8048,14,"Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .",Industrial Designer
8049,14,So,User Interface
8050,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8051,14,we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .,User Interface
8052,14,"Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function .",Industrial Designer
8053,14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
8054,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8055,14,"So that's that's a big advantage , I think .",Industrial Designer
8056,14,"Okay , g good .",Project Manager
8057,14,{vocalsound},User Interface
8058,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8059,14,There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .,Industrial Designer
8060,14,Mm .,Project Manager
8061,14,But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it .,Industrial Designer
8062,14,Yep .,Project Manager
8063,14,There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .,Industrial Designer
8064,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8065,14,"So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .",Industrial Designer
8066,14,But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?,Project Manager
8067,14,You have to do nothing for it .,Industrial Designer
8068,14,M {vocalsound},Marketing
8069,14,{vocalsound} Twelve dollar fifty . {vocalsound},User Interface
8070,14,Because it seems like a very {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
8071,14,"{vocalsound} Maybe , maybe not .",Industrial Designer
8072,14,"And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .",Marketing
8073,14,"I'll have to find that out . Yes . So {disfmarker} No , that's very cheap .",Industrial Designer
8074,14,'Cause when {disfmarker},Marketing
8075,14,Is a cradle very cheap ?,Project Manager
8076,14,"It's {disfmarker} Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .",Industrial Designer
8077,14,"I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .",Project Manager
8078,14,"It's {disfmarker} Yes , but they're they're mass production .",Industrial Designer
8079,14,Yeah .,Marketing
8080,14,They're very cheap .,Industrial Designer
8081,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8082,14,So it will cost us p practically nothing .,Industrial Designer
8083,14,"Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um {vocalsound} I would like to hear um {disfmarker} maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?",Project Manager
8084,14,Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .,Marketing
8085,14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
8086,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8087,14,"But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So {disfmarker} I don't think that's a big problem",Marketing
8088,14,"Okay . Okay , so",Project Manager
8089,14,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
8090,14,"although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh {disfmarker} Profitable . We we {disfmarker} yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",Project Manager
8091,14,"Yes . Yeah , profitable .",Marketing
8092,14,Profitable .,Industrial Designer
8093,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8094,14,Yes .,Marketing
8095,14,O okay . {vocalsound} Um Roo . {gap} {disfmarker} Nothing to add .,Project Manager
8096,14,"I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .",User Interface
8097,14,Sebastian ?,Project Manager
8098,14,Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um,Industrial Designer
8099,14,Yeah ? Great .,Project Manager
8100,14,"so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that {disfmarker} these kinds of things .",Industrial Designer
8101,14,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,Project Manager
8102,14,"Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .",Industrial Designer
8103,14,Yep .,Project Manager
8104,14,"Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not {disfmarker} do not implement these buttons . {vocalsound} If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
8105,14,"Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8106,14,"well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .",Industrial Designer
8107,14,Yeah .,Project Manager
8108,14,And this even uh makes it more cheapy .,Industrial Designer
8109,14,But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?,User Interface
8110,14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
8111,14,The board .,Project Manager
8112,14,The circuit board .,User Interface
8113,14,The circuit board .,Industrial Designer
8114,14,The fewer buttons you can use on it .,User Interface
8115,14,"No , it's th",Project Manager
8116,14,"The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .",Industrial Designer
8117,14,yeah .,Project Manager
8118,14,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface
8119,14,"It's the other way around , yeah .",Project Manager
8120,14,Yeah .,User Interface
8121,14,"And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage .",Industrial Designer
8122,14,It shouldn't be a big issue .,Project Manager
8123,14,Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition .,User Interface
8124,14,"So {disfmarker} Yes , because I don't know {disfmarker} Yes . I d I really don't know . So {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
8125,14,No .,User Interface
8126,14,Okay .,Project Manager
8127,14,It can be costly . Maybe not .,Industrial Designer
8128,14,"I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that .",Project Manager
8129,14,Yes .,Industrial Designer
8130,14,Um I'm not sure how how that {disfmarker},Project Manager
8131,14,"Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh {vocalsound} have a lo uh look at it . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
8132,14,Yep .,Project Manager
8133,14,{vocalsound},User Interface
8134,14,"Okay , great . Um {vocalsound} well , I think we're qui quite done .",Project Manager

8139,14,Me neither .,User Interface
8140,14,"Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um {vocalsound} the Interface Designer , um I would like to {disfmarker} the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .",Project Manager

8145,14,"Well , we understand . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
8146,14,And um,Project Manager
8147,14,Uh the only problem is it {disfmarker} that it depends on the divisions {disfmarker} the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition .,User Interface
8148,14,Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
8149,14,"Well , i it should be easy ,",Project Manager
8150,14,Well {disfmarker},User Interface
8151,14,"that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um {vocalsound} um yeah , some some fancy lights .",Project Manager
8152,14,Mm yes .,Industrial Designer
8153,14,Yeah .,User Interface
8154,14,I think that's what we decided .,Project Manager
8155,14,So we drop the voice recognition ?,Industrial Designer
8156,14,"No no no , we didn't {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8157,14,Or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
8158,14,but it shouldn't be integrated {disfmarker},Project Manager
8159,14,Oh .,Industrial Designer
8160,14,"yeah , it's {disfmarker} of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the {disfmarker}",Project Manager
8161,14,Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now,Industrial Designer
8162,14,No .,Project Manager
8163,14,or can we decide next meeting ?,Industrial Designer
8164,14,We can decide the next meeting . Yep .,Project Manager

8237,15,"um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker} they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .",Industrial Designer
8238,15,Okay .,Project Manager
8239,15,"Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
8240,15,{vocalsound} {gap} .,User Interface
8241,15,"and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top",Industrial Designer
8242,15,The black and white touch screen wherein people can {disfmarker},User Interface
8243,15,Mm . So it's flush .,Project Manager
8244,15,and the buttons at the bottom would d,Industrial Designer

8267,15,"Um it would it would have {disfmarker} obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . {vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker} we haven't {disfmarker} I don't think we actually put it on .",Industrial Designer
8268,15,Like here .,Project Manager
8269,15,"Yeah , yeah , something like that .",Industrial Designer
8270,15,"Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here .",User Interface
8271,15,"Okay . Actually , no , it would be {disfmarker} it would have to be on the on the front .",Project Manager
8272,15,"Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .",Industrial Designer
8273,15,"{gap} . So when it's {disfmarker} even if it's open here , the signals would go {gap} .",User Interface
8274,15,"Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing ,",Project Manager
8275,15,"So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer
8276,15,yes .,Project Manager
8277,15,Yeah .,User Interface
8278,15,"Yeah , that would make sense .",Project Manager
8279,15,"And then finally um on to the interface . {vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen",Industrial Designer
8280,15,{gap} This one right here .,User Interface
8281,15,"which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .",Industrial Designer
8282,15,{gap} .,User Interface
8283,15,Okay .,Project Manager

8285,15,Which is {disfmarker},User Interface
8286,15,But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product,Project Manager

8309,15,Okay .,Marketing
8310,15,Sorry .,Project Manager
8311,15,"This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .",Marketing

8313,15,"{vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .

8331,15,"One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again .

8336,15,Yeah . That works .,Project Manager

9235,16,because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .,Marketing
9236,16,"Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .",Project Manager
9237,16,"Yeah , too fragile .",User Interface
9238,16,Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker},Marketing
9239,16,No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound},Project Manager
9240,16,Kid-proof .,Industrial Designer
9241,16,{vocalsound},Marketing
9242,16,{vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .,User Interface
9243,16,{vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?,Industrial Designer
9244,16,Um {disfmarker},Marketing
9245,16,Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9246,16,"Oh maybe that's a good idea ,",Project Manager
9247,16,Ma maybe a home station .,Marketing
9248,16,"just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,",Project Manager
9249,16,Yeah .,User Interface
9250,16,you never have to use any batteries .,Project Manager
9251,16,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer
9252,16,"Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .",User Interface
9253,16,"Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?",Project Manager
9254,16,Yeah .,Marketing
9255,16,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
9256,16,Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?,User Interface
9257,16,I dunno .,Project Manager
9258,16,"Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,",Industrial Designer
9259,16,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9260,16,Ah yeah .,Marketing
9261,16,but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .,Industrial Designer
9262,16,{gap},Marketing
9263,16,Maybe have {gap} uh {disfmarker},User Interface
9264,16,{vocalsound},Marketing
9265,16,"Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .",Project Manager
9266,16,"Yeah , 'cause well {disfmarker}",User Interface
9267,16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9268,16,"Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,",Marketing
9269,16,"Yeah , that's right , yeah .",Project Manager
9270,16,and now you can put it always at the same place .,Marketing
9271,16,Yeah .,User Interface
9272,16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9273,16,"Maybe it's {disfmarker} Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .",Marketing
9274,16,Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .,User Interface
9275,16,"Yeah . You can {disfmarker} yeah , you can buy it with it .",Marketing
9276,16,"Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
9277,16,Rechargeable .,User Interface
9278,16,"Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,",Industrial Designer
9279,16,Yeah .,User Interface
9280,16,"or you can change your batteries ,",Industrial Designer
9281,16,Oh yeah .,Marketing
9282,16,so .,Industrial Designer
9283,16,"The option , just the option , that's cool .",Project Manager
9284,16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9285,16,"Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,",Marketing
9286,16,Yeah .,Project Manager
9287,16,"uh it has to lay good in the hand ,",Marketing
9288,16,Yeah .,User Interface
9289,16,you you have to uh {disfmarker},Marketing
9290,16,Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control,Project Manager
9291,16,"Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know",Marketing
9292,16,or {disfmarker},Project Manager
9293,16,"Well I think we have to look at that ,",User Interface
9294,16,if we {disfmarker},Marketing
9295,16,"'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}",User Interface
9296,16,"You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,",Marketing
9297,16,Yeah,Project Manager
9298,16,but it's very hard to {disfmarker},Marketing
9299,16,"N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .",Industrial Designer
9300,16,"Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .",User Interface
9301,16,Nah .,Marketing
9302,16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9303,16,"But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .",User Interface
9304,16,Yeah .,Project Manager
9305,16,"So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,",User Interface
9306,16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9307,16,so you can do something unique with that .,User Interface
9308,16,"And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .",Industrial Designer
9309,16,"Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .",Marketing
9310,16,"Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .",Project Manager
9311,16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9312,16,"Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,",Marketing
9313,16,But n {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9314,16,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface
9315,16,"yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,",Industrial Designer
9316,16,and if you fold it open {disfmarker},Marketing
9317,16,But maybe it's,Project Manager
9318,16,Yeah {gap} .,User Interface
9319,16,{gap},Marketing
9320,16,That's what I meant .,User Interface
9321,16,so .,Industrial Designer
9322,16,maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ?,Project Manager
9323,16,Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .,Marketing
9324,16,{gap} Maybe it's hard t,Project Manager
9325,16,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface
9326,16,"No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} .",Project Manager
9327,16,"Okay , but yeah .",User Interface
9328,16,Just think about it .,Project Manager
9329,16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9330,16,"We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so .",Project Manager
9331,16,Okay .,Industrial Designer
9332,16,"There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to {disfmarker} what you have to do ?",Project Manager
9333,16,Okay .,Marketing
9334,16,Yeah .,Project Manager
9335,16,"Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the {disfmarker}",Marketing
9336,16,"{vocalsound} No , what you want to do with it .",User Interface
9337,16,"Yeah , I think this {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together .",Project Manager
9338,16,"Okay . Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh .",Marketing
9339,16,"Yeah , everything .",Project Manager
9340,16,"Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff",User Interface
9341,16,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
9342,16,that you want on a {disfmarker},User Interface
9343,16,"no maybe not not uh {gap} , that's not a f that's something for for for {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
9344,16,Technical fun fu,User Interface
9345,16,That's not for you . Just if {disfmarker},Project Manager
9346,16,Okay .,Marketing
9347,16,"what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .",Project Manager

9382,17,Okay .,User Interface
9383,17,Marketing Experts . {vocalsound},Project Manager
9384,17,Mm .,Marketing
9385,17,"And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .",Project Manager
9386,17,Okay .,User Interface
9387,17,"Um , so you're participant two ?",Project Manager
9388,17,One one .,Industrial Designer

9402,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9403,17,Isn't that technical functions ?,Project Manager
9404,17,No sure .,Marketing
9405,17,So you didn't save it maybe .,Industrial Designer
9406,17,Uh,Marketing
9407,17,It's mine .,User Interface
9408,17,it's David Jordan . Course .,Marketing
9409,17,"Alright , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
9410,17,{vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So,Project Manager
9411,17,David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
9412,17,Mm yeah .,User Interface
9413,17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9414,17,so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .,Project Manager
9415,17,Okay .,User Interface
9416,17,"No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .",Marketing
9417,17,Uh .,Project Manager
9418,17,Too great for email then .,Industrial Designer
9419,17,"Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .",User Interface
9420,17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9421,17,Uh I I will focus on user interface design .,User Interface
9422,17,Mm .,Project Manager
9423,17,"Um so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide .",User Interface
9424,17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9425,17,So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So {disfmarker},User Interface
9426,17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9427,17,That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation .,User Interface
9428,17,So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .,Project Manager
9429,17,"Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions ,",User Interface
9430,17,"So powerful ,",Project Manager
9431,17,but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful .,User Interface
9432,17,many functions and very easy to use .,Project Manager
9433,17,Yes . Yep .,User Interface
9434,17,"So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,",Marketing
9435,17,To merge the two system huh .,Industrial Designer
9436,17,I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple,Marketing
9437,17,Yeah .,User Interface
9438,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9439,17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9440,17,You mean this one ?,Project Manager
9441,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9442,17,"Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .",Project Manager
9443,17,Mm yep .,Industrial Designer
9444,17,{gap},Marketing
9445,17,But But this is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9446,17,But if we have very very good user interface,User Interface
9447,17,"Yeah ,",Marketing
9448,17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9449,17,and then {disfmarker},Marketing
9450,17,it take less time for user to learn how to use it .,User Interface
9451,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9452,17,"Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign .",Industrial Designer
9453,17,Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?,Project Manager
9454,17,"Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .",Industrial Designer
9455,17,"Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah . The user should know .",Marketing
9456,17,"So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So .",Industrial Designer
9457,17,Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker},Project Manager
9458,17,Yeah . So .,Industrial Designer
9459,17,"Go on , go back and {disfmarker}",Project Manager
9460,17,"Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .",Industrial Designer
9461,17,"Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . {vocalsound}",Marketing
9462,17,"Yeah , that's my job . {vocalsound}",User Interface
9463,17,{vocalsound} That's your job {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9464,17,That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .,User Interface
9465,17,{vocalsound},Marketing
9466,17,It you {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9467,17,"So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use .",Project Manager
9468,17,Yep .,User Interface
9469,17,Okay .,Marketing
9470,17,Okay .,Project Manager
9471,17,Powerful and easy to use .,User Interface
9472,17,So that's the point .,Marketing
9473,17,"Yeah , that's the point .",User Interface
9474,17,"So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .",Project Manager
9475,17,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer
9476,17,So you you're {disfmarker},Project Manager
9477,17,Participant two . Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9478,17,Um . Okay .,Project Manager
9479,17,{gap},Marketing
9480,17,"{vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
9481,17,"So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay .",Project Manager
9482,17,"So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the",Industrial Designer
9483,17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
9484,17,"how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based",Industrial Designer
9485,17,Mm .,Marketing
9486,17,"but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_",Industrial Designer
9487,17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9488,17,{vocalsound},Marketing
9489,17,"so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
9490,17,True .,Marketing
9491,17,So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?,Project Manager
9492,17,"I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer
9493,17,Okay .,Marketing
9494,17,"Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen ,",Project Manager
9495,17,What the cost is ?,Marketing
9496,17,yeah . The cost {disfmarker},Project Manager
9497,17,"Twelve , twelve a half .",Marketing
9498,17,"Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here",Industrial Designer
9499,17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
9500,17,and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .,Industrial Designer
9501,17,That might just {disfmarker} So .,Marketing
9502,17,You can go to the next slide .,Industrial Designer
9503,17,Okay .,Project Manager
9504,17,"I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff",Industrial Designer
9505,17,Yeah .,Project Manager
9506,17,"you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .",Industrial Designer
9507,17,What is this ?,Project Manager
9508,17,This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .,Industrial Designer
9509,17,Okay .,Project Manager
9510,17,Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .,Industrial Designer
9511,17,Okay .,Project Manager
9512,17,"So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .",Industrial Designer
9513,17,Okay .,Project Manager
9514,17,Okay .,Marketing
9515,17,"Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?",Industrial Designer
9516,17,What's the average price of this technology then ?,Marketing
9517,17,"Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the",Industrial Designer
9518,17,"So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}",User Interface
9519,17,"{vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .",Industrial Designer
9520,17,Okay .,User Interface
9521,17,So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .,Project Manager
9522,17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9523,17,{vocalsound} Okay . Okay .,User Interface
9524,17,"{vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu",Project Manager
9525,17,But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker},Marketing
9526,17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9527,17,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager
9528,17,{vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .,User Interface
9529,17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
9530,17,"I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,",Marketing
9531,17,"Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,",Industrial Designer
9532,17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9533,17,but in a sense {disfmarker},Marketing
9534,17,sometime I want to have wire because you know .,Industrial Designer
9535,17,"Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?",Project Manager
9536,17,{gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9537,17,{vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?,Project Manager
9538,17,"Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .",Industrial Designer
9539,17,{vocalsound},User Interface
9540,17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9541,17,{vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
9542,17,Okay .,User Interface
9543,17,"Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
9544,17,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager
9545,17,"{vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .",Industrial Designer
9546,17,"Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .",Project Manager
9547,17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9548,17,The wire ?,Marketing
9549,17,As it's {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager
9550,17,Yeah . True .,Marketing
9551,17,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer
9552,17,I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .,Project Manager
9553,17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9554,17,Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker},Marketing
9555,17,"{vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .",Project Manager
9556,17,Now the {disfmarker},Marketing
9557,17,So {disfmarker},Project Manager
9558,17,"Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .",Industrial Designer
9559,17,{vocalsound} So,Project Manager
9560,17,Okay .,User Interface
9561,17,just think of um the usability .,Project Manager
9562,17,Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound},User Interface
9563,17,Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?,Project Manager
9564,17,Yeah .,User Interface
9565,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9566,17,"I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,",Project Manager
9567,17,"Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True .",Marketing
9568,17,yeah .,Project Manager
9569,17,This you will see in my presentation then .,Marketing
9570,17,"{vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .",Project Manager
9571,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9572,17,Okay {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
9573,17,"Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .",Marketing
9574,17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9575,17,"Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .",Marketing
9576,17,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
9577,17,"Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}",Marketing
9578,17,"You mean the loo the look , the outside ?",Project Manager
9579,17,"The look , how it look like .",Industrial Designer
9580,17,"Yeah , the the look is is bad for them",Marketing
9581,17,Okay .,Project Manager
9582,17,"so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .",Marketing
9583,17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9584,17,"So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,",Marketing
9585,17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
9586,17,remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .,Marketing
9587,17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9588,17,"So this is from the experiments we've done ,",Marketing
9589,17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager
9590,17,"so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .",Marketing
9591,17,{vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ?,Project Manager
9592,17,"R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .",Marketing
9593,17,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9594,17,Ah um okay . {vocalsound},Project Manager
9595,17,"Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .",Marketing
9596,17,Okay .,Industrial Designer
9597,17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
9598,17,"And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,",Marketing
9599,17,Functions .,User Interface
9600,17,this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .,Marketing
9601,17,Okay .,Industrial Designer
9602,17,So {disfmarker},Marketing
9603,17,"Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?",Project Manager
9604,17,Yeah .,User Interface
9605,17,Sure ? Yeah ?,Project Manager
9606,17,"Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .",User Interface
9607,17,Yeah .,Project Manager
9608,17,So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .,User Interface
9609,17,"Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?",Project Manager
9610,17,But I'm not sure {disfmarker},User Interface
9611,17,Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .,Project Manager
9612,17,"Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the",Marketing
9613,17,The manuals .,Industrial Designer
9614,17,"Yeah ,",Project Manager
9615,17,manual .,Marketing
9616,17,I think the {disfmarker},Project Manager
9617,17,It's {disfmarker},Marketing
9618,17,"No you you can have a switch menu , so you can",User Interface
9619,17,"Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .",Project Manager
9620,17,"well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .",User Interface
9621,17,"Yeah , okay . Okay ,",Project Manager
9622,17,"Then you you put the switch button ,",User Interface
9623,17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
9624,17,"then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .",User Interface
9625,17,With a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9626,17,"So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .",User Interface
9627,17,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager
9628,17,"But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny .",User Interface
9629,17,Look fancy .,Industrial Designer
9630,17,{gap},Marketing
9631,17,"This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} .",Industrial Designer
9632,17,Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .,User Interface
9633,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9634,17,{vocalsound},User Interface
9635,17,"Yeah , this is something we sh",Marketing
9636,17,"Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so .",User Interface
9637,17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
9638,17,"But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .",Marketing
9639,17,I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9640,17,"Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .",Project Manager
9641,17,"Specially distribution , yeah .",Marketing
9642,17,"Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .",Industrial Designer
9643,17,If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .,Project Manager
9644,17,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing
9645,17,"Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker}",User Interface
9646,17,"Yeah , it will cost little bit more .",Project Manager
9647,17,"Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,",User Interface
9648,17,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer
9649,17,some people prefer black remote control .,User Interface
9650,17,"Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .",Marketing
9651,17,And also f,Project Manager
9652,17,"Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,",User Interface
9653,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9654,17,"so user can select which colour they prefer , so .",User Interface
9655,17,"Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,",Project Manager
9656,17,"Yeah ,",Marketing
9657,17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9658,17,remember it's twelve Euros .,Marketing
9659,17,"and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .",Project Manager
9660,17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9661,17,Hmm .,Marketing
9662,17,"And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .",Project Manager
9663,17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9664,17,So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about,Project Manager
9665,17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
9666,17,and to discuss it with uh the other members .,Project Manager
9667,17,"Yeah , hmm .",Industrial Designer
9668,17,Yeah .,User Interface
9669,17,"So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?",Project Manager
9670,17,"Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .",Marketing
9671,17,Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker},Project Manager
9672,17,So .,Marketing
9673,17,"So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager
9674,17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9675,17,It's is uh {disfmarker},Project Manager
9676,17,"Lame , or {disfmarker}",Marketing
9677,17,"No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .",Project Manager
9678,17,Mm-hmm . Yeah .,User Interface
9679,17,"So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,",Project Manager
9680,17,Yep .,Industrial Designer
9681,17,"and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .",Project Manager
9682,17,Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound},User Interface
9683,17,It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
9684,17,Mm-hmm,Marketing
9685,17,because if we want to to do remote control,Project Manager
9686,17,Mm .,User Interface
9687,17,"which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?",Project Manager
9688,17,Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .,User Interface
9689,17,"So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .",Project Manager
9690,17,Yeah . Okay .,User Interface
9691,17,"And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .",Project Manager
9692,17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9693,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9694,17,I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .,Project Manager
9695,17,Mm-hm .,User Interface
9696,17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9697,17,"So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um",Project Manager
9698,17,Okay .,User Interface
9699,17,of the uh of real reaction,Project Manager
9700,17,Okay .,User Interface
9701,17,So .,Industrial Designer
9702,17,and uh also {disfmarker},Project Manager
9703,17,So has to be yellow .,Marketing
9704,17,Yellow .,Industrial Designer
9705,17,"Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .",Project Manager
9706,17,Okay . Mm-hmm .,User Interface
9707,17,"Require lot of requirements ,",Project Manager
9708,17,"{vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah .",Industrial Designer
9709,17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager
9710,17,Yeah . And cheap .,User Interface
9711,17,Yeah .,Project Manager
9712,17,A low cost .,User Interface
9713,17,Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .,Project Manager
9714,17,"{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .",Industrial Designer
9715,17,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9716,17,This is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
9717,17,I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .,Marketing
9718,17,"Maybe not ,",Project Manager
9719,17,It's maybe more in browsing .,Marketing
9720,17,but mayb,Project Manager
9721,17,"Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .",Industrial Designer
9722,17,"Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it .",User Interface
9723,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9724,17,"A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .",User Interface
9725,17,Okay .,Industrial Designer
9726,17,Ok,User Interface
9727,17,Hm-mm .,Marketing
9728,17,It's It's not so uh popular now . {vocalsound},User Interface
9729,17,"It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know",Industrial Designer
9730,17,Mm .,User Interface
9731,17,"the global usage ,",Industrial Designer
9732,17,"Global ,",User Interface
9733,17,so if people don't have the technology .,Industrial Designer
9734,17,okay .,User Interface
9735,17,So .,Project Manager
9736,17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9737,17,So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?,Project Manager
9738,17,"So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?",User Interface
9739,17,I think it has to be yellow .,Project Manager
9740,17,{vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9741,17,Yeah .,Project Manager
9742,17,Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound},User Interface
9743,17,Min,Marketing
9744,17,"Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .",Project Manager
9745,17,Okay . Okay .,User Interface
9746,17,Yeah .,Marketing
9747,17,I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .,Industrial Designer
9748,17,Why you go {disfmarker} It has to be fashion .,Project Manager
9749,17,"Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,",Industrial Designer
9750,17,So you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager
9751,17,Okay .,User Interface
9752,17,but just mm .,Industrial Designer
9753,17,"Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .",Project Manager
9754,17,"Okay , okay . Okay .",User Interface
9755,17,"And also it has to be attractive , of course ,",Project Manager
9756,17,Mm .,User Interface
9757,17,because if you want to sale {disfmarker} to sell the remote control . It's okay ?,Project Manager
9758,17,"Regarding the first line , what {disfmarker} So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .",Marketing
9759,17,Yeah .,Project Manager
9760,17,And that's it .,Marketing
9761,17,Yeah .,Project Manager
9762,17,"But {disfmarker} I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .",Industrial Designer
9763,17,It's already changed for {disfmarker},Marketing
9764,17,I think it would be simpler .,Project Manager
9765,17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing
9766,17,"Okay . So {disfmarker} I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .

9769,17,"yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .",Project Manager
9770,17,Okay .,User Interface
9771,17,And Florent to work my subject .,Project Manager
9772,17,Yep .,Marketing

9780,17,"Okay {vocalsound} Okay , that's clear .",Industrial Designer
9781,17,Okay {vocalsound} . Okay . {vocalsound},User Interface
9782,17,Should be better . {vocalsound},Project Manager
9783,18,'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
9784,18,"Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
9785,18,"You could change the vegetable , or fruit .",User Interface
9786,18,"yeah , I can change the vegetable .",Industrial Designer
9787,18,Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
9788,18,This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer
9789,18,Yeah .,User Interface
9790,18,So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .,Industrial Designer
9791,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9792,18,"The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .",Industrial Designer
9793,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
9794,18,"You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
9795,18,'S a very bright strawberry . {vocalsound},Project Manager
9796,18,"So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .",Industrial Designer
9797,18,It's been a l,User Interface
9798,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9799,18,"It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .",User Interface
9800,18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
9801,18,Oh yeah .,Project Manager
9802,18,"And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}",User Interface
9803,18,Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .,Industrial Designer
9804,18,Okay so that's just {disfmarker},User Interface
9805,18,And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere,Industrial Designer
9806,18,So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker},User Interface
9807,18,Yeah we didn't design that .,Industrial Designer
9808,18,Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .,User Interface
9809,18,But it would be coordinating with that of course .,Industrial Designer
9810,18,Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .,User Interface
9811,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
9812,18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
9813,18,"You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}",User Interface
9814,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
9815,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9816,18,So . Tada .,User Interface
9817,18,"Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}",Project Manager
9818,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9819,18,"I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be {disfmarker}",Project Manager
9820,18,My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .,Industrial Designer
9821,18,Oh . Okay .,Project Manager
9822,18,"But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means .",Industrial Designer
9823,18,Right .,Project Manager
9824,18,One side is curved and then the other side is curved .,Industrial Designer
9825,18,Well {disfmarker} yeah . If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .,Project Manager
9826,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9827,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
9828,18,Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?,Project Manager
9829,18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
9830,18,Um and lots of special colours actually . {vocalsound} Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?,Project Manager
9831,18,No I think that's alright .,Industrial Designer
9832,18,"Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .",Project Manager
9833,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9834,18,And if we sold a lot of squishy things .,Project Manager
9835,18,Mm .,User Interface
9836,18,Boo yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} S So {disfmarker} Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The {disfmarker},Project Manager

9840,18,Okay . I think that's {disfmarker},Project Manager
9841,18,"So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't {disfmarker} okay . Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?",Marketing
9842,18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
9843,18,"Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .",Marketing
9844,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
9845,18,"I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .",Marketing
9846,18,Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own {disfmarker} {gap},User Interface

9880,18,Yes ? Very very true . Okay .,Marketing

10020,18,Okay . Um {disfmarker},Project Manager
10021,18,Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .,Marketing
10022,18,"No no that's um {disfmarker} I think we should look at the ones that {vocalsound} like where s where people said four , where {disfmarker} um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .",Project Manager
10023,18,I didn't know how else to do it . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .,Marketing
10024,18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
10025,18,Do {disfmarker} does every ones have the slide ?,Marketing
10026,18,The {disfmarker},Project Manager
10027,18,Three point one .,Marketing

10034,18,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager
10035,18,Yeah that {disfmarker} it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .,Marketing
10036,18,Does the shape {disfmarker},Project Manager
10037,18,The shape .,Marketing
10038,18,I think {disfmarker},User Interface
10039,18,Four point two ?,Marketing
10040,18,"See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the {disfmarker} is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It {disfmarker} or bigger ?",Project Manager
10041,18,I think the wheel would probably be {disfmarker} mm .,Industrial Designer
10042,18,Because {disfmarker},Project Manager
10043,18,What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?,User Interface
10044,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10045,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10046,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10047,18,And like then it {disfmarker} you could hold it in your hand better .,User Interface
10048,18,"I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .",Industrial Designer
10049,18,"Yeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get {disfmarker} that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10050,18,Yeah .,User Interface
10051,18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10052,18,The flat one . Yeah .,User Interface
10053,18,so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .,Project Manager
10054,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10055,18,Yeah .,User Interface
10056,18,"{vocalsound} Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .",Project Manager
10057,18,I didn't {disfmarker} yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker},User Interface
10058,18,Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .,Industrial Designer
10059,18,"But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .",User Interface
10060,18,Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?,Project Manager
10061,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10062,18,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
10063,18,"Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,",User Interface
10064,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10065,18,like you could probably do a strawberry still .,User Interface
10066,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10067,18,I think the broccoli would be out .,User Interface
10068,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10069,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10070,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10071,18,"You could do {gap} , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like {disfmarker} sorta like a joystick .",User Interface
10072,18,"Yeah that I I {disfmarker} when you were holding that before , it actually looked {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager
10073,18,Yeah . That looked really good .,Marketing
10074,18,I don't know . So {disfmarker},User Interface
10075,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10076,18,"Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?",Marketing
10077,18,Uh .,User Interface
10078,18,Not that I can think of . Rhubarb . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10079,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10080,18,{vocalsound} Rhubarb .,User Interface
10081,18,{vocalsound} I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .,Marketing
10082,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10083,18,{vocalsound} These obscure fruits .,User Interface
10084,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10085,18,Uh despite the {disfmarker},Marketing
10086,18,{vocalsound} I think we needn't {disfmarker},User Interface
10087,18,What if um the {disfmarker} it was just patterns on like {disfmarker} we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .,Project Manager
10088,18,Huh ?,User Interface
10089,18,You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .,Project Manager
10090,18,Oh okay .,User Interface
10091,18,"So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .",Industrial Designer
10092,18,Yeah . That could work .,User Interface
10093,18,Yeah . {gap},Marketing
10094,18,Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager
10095,18,Yeah .,User Interface
10096,18,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager
10097,18,Yeah . I dunno .,User Interface
10098,18,But if we if we need {disfmarker},Project Manager
10099,18,Yeah and just have the colour match or something .,Marketing
10100,18,"yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10101,18,{vocalsound},User Interface
10102,18,{vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker},Project Manager
10103,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10104,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10105,18,Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .,User Interface
10106,18,Mm . {vocalsound},Project Manager
10107,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10108,18,Mm .,Marketing
10109,18,"Or like {disfmarker} I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think {disfmarker} see as like {disfmarker}",User Interface
10110,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10111,18,"like you could {disfmarker} if it was only this {disfmarker} you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .",User Interface
10112,18,Yeah . Yeah .,Project Manager
10113,18,So like maybe that's just too big,User Interface
10114,18,"Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,",Project Manager
10115,18,because {disfmarker},User Interface
10116,18,which is a nice kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
10117,18,Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .,User Interface
10118,18,Yeah .,Marketing
10119,18,yeah . But {disfmarker},Project Manager
10120,18,{gap} I dunno .,User Interface
10121,18,I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?,Project Manager
10122,18,I guess {disfmarker},User Interface
10123,18,'Cause like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager
10124,18,"We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .",Industrial Designer
10125,18,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
10126,18,Yeah .,User Interface
10127,18,Yeah .,Marketing
10128,18,Or like even {disfmarker},Project Manager
10129,18,Dif,User Interface
10130,18,We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .,Industrial Designer
10131,18,"Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?",Project Manager
10132,18,Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .,User Interface
10133,18,"'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .",Project Manager
10134,18,Yeah .,User Interface
10135,18,And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .,Project Manager
10136,18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer
10137,18,Yeah .,Marketing
10138,18,Mm .,User Interface
10139,18,"And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .",Project Manager
10140,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10141,18,Yeah . Yeah . Alright .,User Interface
10142,18,But I mean it {disfmarker} do we have any other ideas about that ?,Project Manager
10143,18,Um {disfmarker},Marketing
10144,18,We could tr I don't know .,User Interface
10145,18,"Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one . {vocalsound} . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,",Marketing
10146,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10147,18,which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .,Marketing
10148,18,The batteries are going in the back ?,Project Manager
10149,18,That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .,Industrial Designer
10150,18,No .,Marketing
10151,18,The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker},Project Manager
10152,18,"No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,",Industrial Designer
10153,18,no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .,Project Manager
10154,18,yeah um like on a normal remote .,Industrial Designer
10155,18,Right .,Project Manager
10156,18,"So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .",Industrial Designer
10157,18,Okay .,Project Manager
10158,18,I think everyone's under three anyway .,Marketing
10159,18,Mm .,Project Manager
10160,18,So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .,Marketing
10161,18,Cool . Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .,User Interface
10162,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10163,18,{vocalsound} Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .,Industrial Designer
10164,18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing
10165,18,Okay .,Project Manager
10166,18,"Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer
10167,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10168,18,{vocalsound} We were a bit off task .,User Interface
10169,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10170,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10171,18,Um so uh I can't think of any {disfmarker} So we'll have to like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm .,User Interface
10172,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10173,18,"Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,",User Interface
10174,18,It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .,Industrial Designer
10175,18,but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .,User Interface
10176,18,"Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .",Project Manager
10177,18,Yeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .,User Interface
10178,18,I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .,Industrial Designer
10179,18,Yeah . Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .,Project Manager
10180,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10181,18,Hmm .,User Interface
10182,18,"Mm . {vocalsound} Not really {disfmarker} Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . {vocalsound} Um so project evaluation .",Project Manager
10183,18,Do you want this and we can all {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .,Marketing
10184,18,"I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied {disfmarker} oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah .",Project Manager
10185,18,It's alright yeah ?,Marketing
10186,18,Um {disfmarker} Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of {disfmarker},Project Manager
10187,18,Sure .,Industrial Designer
10188,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10189,18,I did .,User Interface
10190,18,I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
10191,18,Yeah .,Marketing
10192,18,{vocalsound} Sponginess . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10193,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10194,18,The prototype making was very creatively stimulating,User Interface
10195,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10196,18,and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria {vocalsound} .,User Interface
10197,18,And how was our leadership and teamwork ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
10198,18,I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .,Industrial Designer
10199,18,Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .,Project Manager
10200,18,"{vocalsound} Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .",Industrial Designer
10201,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10202,18,"{vocalsound} Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Um .",Project Manager
10203,18,I think you were fine .,User Interface

10210,18,Yeah we didn't {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} uh it all c sort of blended quite well .,Marketing
10211,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10212,18,"Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like {vocalsound} I don't know , all had ideas about it but {disfmarker}",User Interface
10213,18,"Yeah . Very democratic . No spats , that was good .",Project Manager
10214,18,{vocalsound} yeah .,User Interface
10215,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10216,18,No . {vocalsound},User Interface

10218,18,"{vocalsound} Um and the means for like {disfmarker} the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,",Project Manager
10219,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10220,18,I mean we used {disfmarker},Project Manager
10221,18,"Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .",Industrial Designer
10222,18,Are you a Mac person ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
10223,18,No no I never touch Macs either .,Industrial Designer
10224,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10225,18,"I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .",Industrial Designer
10226,18,Huh .,Project Manager
10227,18,Hmm .,User Interface
10228,18,Which isn't very user-friendly though . {vocalsound},Marketing
10229,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10230,18,Yeah . {vocalsound} Well the problem is if you don't {disfmarker} like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now . But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .,Industrial Designer
10231,18,"I felt like my {disfmarker} I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my {disfmarker} the information that was available to me was kind of just like {disfmarker} or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda {disfmarker} it was kinda like okay , I don't really think {disfmarker} I dunno what I'm doing here .",User Interface
10232,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10233,18,Mm .,Project Manager
10234,18,"So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations ,",User Interface
10235,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10236,18,so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .,User Interface
10237,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10238,18,"But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , {vocalsound} think it's kinda stupid .",User Interface
10239,18,Yeah . I never use it .,Industrial Designer
10240,18,Yeah but uh {disfmarker},User Interface
10241,18,I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Like I {disfmarker},Project Manager
10242,18,Yeah .,User Interface
10243,18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10244,18,It didn't really {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface
10245,18,It {disfmarker},Project Manager
10246,18,My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .,Industrial Designer
10247,18,I though it was brilliant no ? {vocalsound},Marketing
10248,18,Really ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
10249,18,{vocalsound},User Interface
10250,18,No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .,Marketing
10251,18,I mean m my problem {disfmarker},Project Manager
10252,18,{vocalsound} Yeah it probably does .,Industrial Designer
10253,18,So like a f,User Interface
10254,18,I think it depends on the role,Marketing
10255,18,"yeah , yeah .",Project Manager
10256,18,Yeah I think so .,User Interface
10257,18,no ?,Marketing
10258,18,"'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like {disfmarker} they'd put {disfmarker} send you to sites and stuff right ?",Project Manager
10259,18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10260,18,"See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like {disfmarker}",Project Manager
10261,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10262,18,"you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things ,",Project Manager
10263,18,{vocalsound},Marketing
10264,18,'cause I {disfmarker},Project Manager
10265,18,Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control .,Industrial Designer
10266,18,Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager
10267,18,As if you'd wanted to .,Industrial Designer
10268,18,Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um,Marketing
10269,18,System . Yeah .,Project Manager
10270,18,"a whole system ,",Marketing
10271,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10272,18,'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the {disfmarker},Marketing
10273,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10274,18,"Yeah I mean , it {gap}",User Interface
10275,18,"Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10276,18,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing
10277,18,"Yeah , huh .",Project Manager
10278,18,It seems planned you know .,Industrial Designer
10279,18,Yeah . {vocalsound},Project Manager
10280,18,"Yeah I kinda thought that um {disfmarker} I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated",User Interface
10281,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10282,18,because {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface
10283,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10284,18,I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um {disfmarker},User Interface
10285,18,Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like {disfmarker} we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?,Project Manager
10286,18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10287,18,Yeah .,User Interface
10288,18,No . {vocalsound},Marketing
10289,18,{vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker},Project Manager
10290,18,If I hadn't been told that fruit was {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10291,18,But I think that {vocalsound} it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .,Marketing
10292,18,Oh right . given certain information or {disfmarker} Just {disfmarker},Project Manager
10293,18,"Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input {disfmarker}",Marketing
10294,18,yeah .,Project Manager
10295,18,"I don't have a clue , anyway .",Marketing
10296,18,"Mm , mm .",Project Manager
10297,18,Um what's next ? Looks like {disfmarker} oh no that's not um {disfmarker},Marketing
10298,18,What do you guys think of the pens ?,Project Manager
10299,18,It's quite {disfmarker},Marketing
10300,18,It asks about that .,Project Manager
10301,18,They're pretty cool .,Industrial Designer
10302,18,Mm .,Project Manager
10303,18,I wanna s,User Interface
10304,18,They're kinda hard to write with though .,Industrial Designer
10305,18,Yeah,Project Manager
10306,18,Yeah .,Marketing
10307,18,and I I've f forgotten once or twice to {vocalsound} check the box . {vocalsound},Project Manager
10308,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10309,18,I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the {disfmarker},User Interface
10310,18,"They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write .",Industrial Designer
10311,18,Mm .,Project Manager
10312,18,"But even so , I dunno .",Industrial Designer
10313,18,And new ideas found ?,Project Manager
10314,18,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10315,18,"Yeah it's all very new ,",Marketing
10316,18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager
10317,18,no ? It's all very new .,Marketing
10318,18,Yeah I think I'd like to um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I dunno . Like it was {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface
10319,18,Sorry .,Marketing
10320,18,"I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're {disfmarker} like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like .",User Interface
10321,18,Oh yeah . Well they drop off if you like move too much .,Industrial Designer
10322,18,Yeah I dunno . But they're they're okay .,User Interface
10323,18,But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . Maybe we are .,Industrial Designer
10324,18,Mm .,Project Manager
10325,18,I don't know . {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10326,18,"{vocalsound} Uh I think , and I think that uh all this technology like {disfmarker} I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes ,",User Interface
10327,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10328,18,"Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company ,",Industrial Designer
10329,18,or like {disfmarker} I dunno .,User Interface
10330,18,and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . Like usually I missed meetings deliberately .,Industrial Designer
10331,18,{vocalsound},Project Manager
10332,18,"There's just {disfmarker} there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company .",Industrial Designer
10333,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10334,18,It's mostly like rehashing old stuff .,Industrial Designer
10335,18,Hm .,User Interface
10336,18,And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know .,Industrial Designer
10337,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10338,18,It's like the {disfmarker} there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .,Industrial Designer
10339,18,Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration .,Project Manager
10340,18,It seems like way overkill .,Industrial Designer
10341,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10342,18,Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .,Industrial Designer
10343,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10344,18,I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10345,18,Yeah .,Project Manager
10346,18,"I guess it would be {disfmarker} it's gotta be worth it to {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . How about a p {vocalsound} a {gap} {vocalsound} ?",User Interface

10351,18,Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? {vocalsound},Project Manager
10352,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10353,18,Any other ideas for {disfmarker},Project Manager
10354,18,What what's the end ? Are we are we supposed to um {disfmarker} you supposed to write a report ? Or we ending ?,Marketing
10355,18,Um we still have time if there's any other input .,Project Manager
10356,18,Is that the end ?,Marketing
10357,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10358,18,"{vocalsound} I mean the {disfmarker} I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'Cause I mean we've all {disfmarker} we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy .",Project Manager
10359,18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10360,18,{gap},Marketing

10373,18,"{vocalsound} I think it would be a good idea , I like it . {vocalsound}",User Interface
10374,18,{vocalsound} It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . Especially if you have food .,Industrial Designer
10375,18,So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 'Cause {disfmarker},Project Manager
10376,18,All of us ?,Industrial Designer
10377,18,I don't know . Hmm .,Project Manager
10378,18,"Well there's al eight , nine .",Marketing

10393,19,{vocalsound} Your judgement it's {disfmarker} is biased . {vocalsound},Project Manager

10640,19,Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker},Marketing
10641,19,What other {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10642,19,The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .,Marketing
10643,19,Is it easy to use ? {vocalsound},Industrial Designer
10644,19,Feasible ? {vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an,Project Manager

10665,19,"Oh , yeah .",Project Manager
10666,19,"Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe {disfmarker} okay .",Marketing
10667,19,"I think technically it's acceptable , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer
10668,19,Maybe two ?,Project Manager
10669,19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer
10670,19,"So using the same scale , two ?",Marketing
10671,19,Two ? I would say two,Project Manager

10678,19,Now maybe the most critical one .,Marketing
10679,19,Okay .,Project Manager
10680,19,{vocalsound} Most {disfmarker},Industrial Designer
10681,19,{vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ?,Marketing
