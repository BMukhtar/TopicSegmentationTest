0,So .,Project Manager,11
0,We'll get to that .,Project Manager,11
0,Oh there it is .,Project Manager,11

0,"Uh {disfmarker} Does it have to be {vocalsound} functional , trendy and user friendly ?",User Interface,22
0,{vocalsound},User Interface,22
0,{vocalsound} I don't think so .,Project Manager,23
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,24

0,I don't know how intelligent that one looks {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,44
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,45
0,Yeah he he doesn't look that smart {vocalsound} .,User Interface,46
0,"He's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I dunno um they're {disfmarker} I think it's cool the the um {vocalsound} the interaction that or the th things that {disfmarker} the reasons people seem to like you know {disfmarker} you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like {vocalsound} {disfmarker} but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim .",User Interface,46
0,{gap} {vocalsound},User Interface,46
0,Yes .,Project Manager,47

0,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,49
0,{vocalsound},User Interface,50
0,Uh-oh there goes the ten .,Project Manager,51
0,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,52

0,{vocalsound},Project Manager,53
0,{vocalsound},User Interface,54
0,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,55
0,"They sleep all day , {vocalsound} they're easy to draw {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,55
0,{vocalsound} Do you wanna {gap} anything ?,Project Manager,56
0,Uh yeah .,Marketing,57
0,I dunno if the the {disfmarker},Project Manager,58
0,I think the pen is running out of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,59
0,"Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one .",Marketing,60
0,ah .,Project Manager,61
0,{vocalsound},User Interface,62
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,63
0,So I'll use the spare one .,Marketing,64
0,Um but it's harder to draw {gap} um .,Marketing,64
0,And the pen's dying {vocalsound} .,User Interface,65
0,Um .,Marketing,66
0,A horse .,Project Manager,67
0,Horse .,User Interface,68
0,Uh .,Marketing,69
0,"Um I don't {vocalsound} really know how the legs go ,",Marketing,69
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,70
0,That's very good .,Project Manager,71
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,72
0,but anyway I will do that .,Marketing,73
0,"Um , and the main reason is they're pretty .",Marketing,73
0,"I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals .",Marketing,73
0,"And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it .",Marketing,73
0,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,73
0,{gap} Yeah .,Project Manager,74
0,This cord's {disfmarker} {gap} Uh .,Project Manager,74
0,Right .,Project Manager,74
0,Actually I haven't thought of anything yet {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,74
0,Uh {disfmarker} It's a pig .,Project Manager,74
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,75
0,{vocalsound},Marketing,76
0,"{vocalsound} So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry .",Project Manager,77
0,"What do you think , yeah ?",Project Manager,77
0,This is {disfmarker},Project Manager,77
0,And furry .,User Interface,78
0,"yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .",Project Manager,79
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,80
0,"Textile {disfmarker} tactile , {vocalsound} tactile remote control .",User Interface,81
0,{vocalsound},Marketing,82
0,{vocalsound} Although {disfmarker} uh I'll just put there .,Project Manager,83
0,Right .,Project Manager,83
0,You're dragging a {disfmarker} you have a tail {vocalsound} .,User Interface,84
0,"{gap} Oh my gosh , this is disastrous .",Project Manager,85
0,Sorry about that .,Project Manager,85
0,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,85
0,{vocalsound} So moving on .,Project Manager,85
0,Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro .,Project Manager,85
0,"So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country {vocalsound} .",Project Manager,85
0,"Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .",Project Manager,85
0,Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ?,User Interface,86
0,Um selling price is twenty five Euro .,Project Manager,87
0,Profit aim fifty million Euro .,Project Manager,87
0,Okay .,User Interface,88
0,How many should we sell then ?,Marketing,89
0,"{vocalsound} Um , a lot ,",Marketing,89
0,Anyone a mathematician ?,Project Manager,90
0,{vocalsound},Project Manager,90
0,"two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million .",Marketing,91
0,Two million .,Industrial Designer,92
0,Four million .,Marketing,93
0,And it {disfmarker},Marketing,93
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,94
0,"well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .",Marketing,95
0,"Oh , yeah .",Industrial Designer,96
0,{vocalsound} It is a lot .,Marketing,97
0,Uh .,Marketing,97
0,So f that's a fifty percent um uh .,Project Manager,98
0,"Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show .",Project Manager,98
0,Experience with remote control .,Project Manager,98
0,"So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control .",Project Manager,98
0,Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .,Project Manager,98
0,"Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find",Marketing,99
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,100
0,I was thinking that too .,User Interface,101
0,bec yeah {vocalsound} bec,Marketing,102
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,103
0,"I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,",User Interface,104
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,105
0,"I've always wanted that ,",User Interface,106
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,107
0,so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker},User Interface,108
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .",Marketing,109
0,"I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,110
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .",User Interface,111
0,Yeah .,Marketing,112
0,And even I think a little light .,Marketing,112
0,Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing .,Marketing,112
0,I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .,Marketing,112
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,113
0,Yeah .,User Interface,114
0,Yeah .,User Interface,114
0,In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker},Marketing,115
0,Yeah .,User Interface,116
0,I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker},Marketing,117
0,I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker},User Interface,118
0,Maybe call is enough .,Marketing,119
0,But yeah .,Marketing,119
0,"just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}",User Interface,120
0,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,121
0,Yeah .,Marketing,121
0,What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .,Project Manager,122
0,"You know like a portable phone has a base ,",Project Manager,122
0,Yeah .,User Interface,123
0,"Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah .",User Interface,123
0,like just to have a home for it .,Project Manager,124
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,125
0,Yeah yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,126
0,"Yeah ,",User Interface,127
0,"{vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,128
0,I mean {disfmarker},User Interface,129
0,{vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch .,Industrial Designer,130
0,Yeah .,User Interface,131
0,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,132
0,"Yeah , in in the couch {vocalsound} .",User Interface,133
0,{vocalsound},Marketing,134
0,{gap},Project Manager,135
0,"I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker}",User Interface,136
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,137
0,Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm .,Project Manager,137
0,{vocalsound},Project Manager,137
0,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,138
0,Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls .,User Interface,139
0,"{vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall .",Marketing,140
0,But that would really make it more expensive .,Marketing,140
0,Yeah .,User Interface,141
0,"But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .",Marketing,142
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,143
0,Yeah .,User Interface,144
0,Something like that .,Marketing,145
0,"Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?",Project Manager,146
0,And the other thing is {disfmarker},Marketing,147
0,Bigger .,User Interface,148
0,Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker},Marketing,149
0,"Like Hand hand held size , yeah .",Project Manager,150
0,Hand-sized .,User Interface,151
0,Yeah .,Marketing,152
0,I don't think you need a {disfmarker},Marketing,152
0,"Not not huge , but {vocalsound}",Project Manager,153
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,154
0,But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .,Marketing,155
0,It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .,User Interface,156
0,"No , it can't be , uh-uh .",Marketing,157
0,No it really wouldn't be .,Industrial Designer,158
0,Huh .,Project Manager,159
0,Or like or like a light thing .,User Interface,160
0,You know .,User Interface,160
0,I dunno {vocalsound},User Interface,160
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,161
0,{vocalsound} Like spaceship .,Marketing,162
0,.,User Interface,163
0,Yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface,163
0,Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface,163
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,164
0,{vocalsound},Project Manager,165
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,166
0,That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .,User Interface,167
0,Little homing device .,Project Manager,168
0,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um .,Project Manager,168
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,169
0,{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface,170
0,Uh .,User Interface,170
0,Okay .,Project Manager,171
0,So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes .,Project Manager,171
0,Oh dear .,Marketing,172
0,Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right .,Project Manager,173
0,This is what we have left .,Project Manager,173
0,"Um , oh we just {gap}",Project Manager,173
0,"I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,",User Interface,174
0,"Yeah , I agree .",Industrial Designer,175
0,'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker},User Interface,176
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,177
0,"{vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .",Industrial Designer,178
0,"Yeah , yeah yeah .",Marketing,179
0,"I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them .",User Interface,180
0,So .,User Interface,180
0,"You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions .",Project Manager,181
0,Like the way a mobile phone does .,Project Manager,181
0,That would be cool .,User Interface,182
0,Yeah .,Marketing,183
0,Yeah .,User Interface,184
0,I mean it just seems like {disfmarker},User Interface,184
0,"So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,185
0,yeah .,User Interface,186
0,what do you call it {disfmarker},Project Manager,187
0,Select .,Marketing,188
0,Uh .,Marketing,188
0,"s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s",Project Manager,189
0,"But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .",Marketing,190
0,That's something we could decide .,Project Manager,191
0,Mm .,Project Manager,191
0,Because {disfmarker},Marketing,192
0,I guess they would go together somehow ?,User Interface,193
0,I dunno .,User Interface,193
0,"Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,",Marketing,194
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,195
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,195
0,and then use the telly as a screen .,Marketing,196
0,Right .,Project Manager,197
0,But um {disfmarker},Marketing,198
0,I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker},User Interface,199
0,But yeah for sure .,Marketing,200
0,"Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,",Marketing,200
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,201
0,is that what you mean ?,Marketing,202
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,203
0,Right .,Marketing,204
0,Mm .,Marketing,204
0,"Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker}",User Interface,205
0,Yeah .,Marketing,206
0,must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .,User Interface,207
0,Mm .,Project Manager,208
0,But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .,Marketing,209
0,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,210
0,Yeah that's true .,User Interface,210
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,211
0,"I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point {disfmarker} twelve fifty for {disfmarker} to actually make the device .",Project Manager,211
0,Yeah .,Marketing,212
0,Mm .,User Interface,213
0,"Um but it's something to think about , yeah .",Project Manager,214
0,"Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .",User Interface,215
0,I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .,Project Manager,216
0,{vocalsound},User Interface,217
0,Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker},Marketing,218
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,219
0,Um .,Marketing,220
0,"Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}",Marketing,220
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,221
0,What was the word ?,Marketing,222
0,Furry .,User Interface,223
0,Water resistant .,Marketing,224
0,Oh I was just {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,225
0,{vocalsound},User Interface,226
0,"No but it's {disfmarker} I thought , ah , spot on .",Marketing,227
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,228
0,"Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel ,",Marketing,229
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,230
0,maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .,Marketing,231
0,Yeah .,User Interface,232
0,"Mm , mm .",User Interface,232
0,That's quite annoying .,Marketing,233
0,"Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}",Project Manager,234
0,Yeah .,User Interface,235
0,like that's another {disfmarker},Project Manager,236
0,"Yeah , clip .",Marketing,237
0,Ooh {vocalsound} .,Marketing,237
0,Um .,Marketing,237
0,Um .,Project Manager,238
0,"We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into .",Project Manager,238
0,"Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes .",Project Manager,238
0,Um .,Project Manager,238
0,So .,Project Manager,238
0,Yeah .,Project Manager,238
0,"The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ ,",Project Manager,238
0,Yeah I think so .,Industrial Designer,239
0,yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design .,Project Manager,240
0,So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing .,Project Manager,240
0,"The something , what is the U_I_ ?",Project Manager,240
0,User .,Industrial Designer,241
0,"Yeah , what does it stand for again ?",Project Manager,242
0,That's me .,User Interface,243
0,"Uh , User Interface design .",User Interface,243
0,User Interface Designer .,Project Manager,244
0,So that's gonna be more technical .,Project Manager,244
0,I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w,Project Manager,244
0,So technical function .,User Interface,245
0,The working design is the structure .,Industrial Designer,246
0,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,247
0,What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker},User Interface,248
0,"Um , I guess you'd have to find out {vocalsound} .",Project Manager,249
0,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,250
0,{gap},User Interface,251
0,Um .,Industrial Designer,252
0,It says on that email but it {disfmarker},Marketing,253
0,It was in the email .,Industrial Designer,254
0,It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker},User Interface,255
0,I wrote down what mine were .,Industrial Designer,256
0,It said um {disfmarker},Marketing,257
0,Yeah .,User Interface,258
0,It said {disfmarker},Marketing,259
0,"{vocalsound} What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay .",User Interface,260
0,Alright .,User Interface,260
0,Yeah,Marketing,261
0,And working design .,User Interface,262
0,like {disfmarker},Marketing,263
0,Okay .,User Interface,264
0,"Be a medium between you and the telly I think ,",Marketing,265
0,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,266
0,Alright .,User Interface,266
0,Mm .,Project Manager,267
0,that's uh {disfmarker},Marketing,268
0,"And how it works , okay .",User Interface,269
0,Right .,User Interface,269
0,I'm I'm on task .,User Interface,269
0,"And the M_E_ , what does that stand for {vocalsound} ?",Project Manager,270
0,M,Project Manager,270
0,Marketing .,Industrial Designer,271
0,"Marketing , right .",Project Manager,272
0,Um {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,272
0,Marketing .,Marketing,273
0,"Oh it's written here , but um .",Marketing,273
0,"So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker} Yeah .",Project Manager,274
0,Okay .,Marketing,275
0,So I guess that wraps it up .,Project Manager,276
0,I'll see you all in thirty minutes .,Project Manager,276
0,I just did .,Project Manager,276
1,That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button .,User Interface,1
1,Like this one .,Industrial Designer,2
1,"But uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers .",User Interface,3
1,It's important .,Industrial Designer,4
1,Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve .,Industrial Designer,4
1,Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control .,Industrial Designer,4
1,"And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often .",Industrial Designer,4
1,But other users who are new to this device need something like that .,Industrial Designer,4
1,Okay .,Project Manager,5
1,"They n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them",Industrial Designer,6
1,Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ?,Project Manager,7
1,"A a and the voice recognition as well ,",Project Manager,7
1,"Yeah , maybe so .",Industrial Designer,8
1,"Yes , it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,8
1,th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,9
1,"Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} .",Industrial Designer,10
1,{vocalsound} There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device .,Industrial Designer,10
1,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,11
1,It's it's quite easy .,Industrial Designer,12
1,Okay .,Project Manager,13
1,"Okay , good .",Project Manager,13
1,And and the case is is rubber ?,Project Manager,13
1,"Yes , rubber ?",Industrial Designer,14
1,And the buttons ?,Project Manager,15
1,{vocalsound} Plastic or rubber .,User Interface,16
1,{vocalsound} There are plastic or rubber .,Industrial Designer,17
1,"Well ,",User Interface,18
1,"Okay ,",Project Manager,19
1,yeah .,User Interface,20
1,and uh the colouring ?,Project Manager,21
1,Uh yellow with uh,Industrial Designer,22
1,{gap} with with grey or black .,Project Manager,23
1,grey or black or something like that .,Industrial Designer,24
1,Whatever cost uh cost uh the least .,Industrial Designer,24
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,24
1,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",Project Manager,25
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,26
1,we'll we'll come to that later .,Project Manager,27
1,Um,Project Manager,27
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,28
1,okay .,Project Manager,29
1,Anything else to add or {disfmarker},Project Manager,29
1,No .,Industrial Designer,30
1,{vocalsound} Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons .,Industrial Designer,30
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,31
1,{vocalsound} But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,32
1,"Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button ,",Marketing,33
1,"Yes , but it {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,34
1,'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels .,Marketing,35
1,"but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .",Industrial Designer,36
1,M uh yeah .,Project Manager,37
1,Or not ?,Industrial Designer,38
1,"M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .",Project Manager,39
1,You {disfmarker},Marketing,40
1,Well okay .,Industrial Designer,41
1,"Okay , yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer,41
1,Or something li like that .,Industrial Designer,41
1,And a button for disabling the voice recognition .,User Interface,42
1,"Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker}",Project Manager,43
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,44
1,Yeah .,User Interface,45
1,"but o okay , that that's not really really important .",Project Manager,46
1,"{vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah .",User Interface,47
1,Of our prototype .,User Interface,47
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,48
1,The basic {disfmarker} okay .,Project Manager,49
1,Okay .,Project Manager,49
1,Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?,Project Manager,49
1,Yes .,Marketing,50
1,Okay .,Project Manager,51
1,Uh my name is not name,Marketing,52
1,{vocalsound} You are nameless .,Project Manager,53
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,53
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,54
1,but {disfmarker},Marketing,55
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,56
1,"Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents .",Marketing,57
1,And these uh were the most important criteria .,Marketing,57
1,{vocalsound} Is it spongy ?,Industrial Designer,58
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,58
1,It should be .,Marketing,59
1,"{gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah ,",Marketing,59
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,60
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,61
1,that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it .,Marketing,62
1,Fancy look and feel .,Marketing,62
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing,62
1,So just walk through it step by step .,User Interface,63
1,"I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy .",User Interface,63
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,63
1,Uh well appar,Marketing,64
1,I believe it's fancy too .,Industrial Designer,65
1,"Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet .",Marketing,66
1,No .,Project Manager,67
1,"Oh , sorry .",User Interface,68
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing,69
1,"Okay , so",Project Manager,70
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,71
1,this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria .,Project Manager,72
1,"Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .",Marketing,73
1,"Okay , well {disfmarker}",Project Manager,74
1,So uh,Marketing,75
1,the then we'll switch to my presentation .,Project Manager,76
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,76
1,that's about it .,Marketing,77
1,The production costs .,Project Manager,78
1,The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker},Project Manager,78
1,Twenty two .,User Interface,79
1,"Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty .",Project Manager,80
1,Yikes .,User Interface,81
1,And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell .,Project Manager,82
1,"So I guess we should skip that ,",Project Manager,82
1,Well it's very expensive .,Industrial Designer,83
1,because it's not that important .,Project Manager,84
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,85
1,"Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa",User Interface,86
1,"Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .",Project Manager,87
1,yeah .,User Interface,88
1,The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,88
1,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,89
1,"Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model .",Project Manager,90
1,Um if you would {disfmarker},Project Manager,90
1,And and does it {disfmarker},User Interface,91
1,"if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes .",Project Manager,92
1,"Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,",Project Manager,92
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,93
1,because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .,Project Manager,94
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,95
1,"Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,96
1,"Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .",Project Manager,96
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,97
1,"So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .",Project Manager,98
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,99
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,100
1,But I'm afraid it's not complete .,Industrial Designer,101
1,"Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item .",Industrial Designer,101
1,And you have not added one item there .,Industrial Designer,101
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,102
1,So it's c way too expensive .,Industrial Designer,103
1,"It's still too expensive , yeah .",Project Manager,104
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,104
1,But that's that's only for the buttons .,User Interface,105
1,"I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,106
1,So the button we can use plastic .,User Interface,107
1,oh .,Project Manager,108
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,108
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,109
1,And uh maybe not use the special form .,Project Manager,110
1,"And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .",User Interface,111
1,But it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,112
1,"{vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .",Project Manager,113
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,114
1,But it's the board decision .,Project Manager,115
1,Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,115
1,"Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .",Industrial Designer,116
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,117
1,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,117
1,Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,117
1,So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment .,Industrial Designer,118
1,"Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic",Project Manager,119
1,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,120
1,and uh m maximise the profits,Project Manager,121
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,122
1,and um {disfmarker},Project Manager,123
1,That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better .,Industrial Designer,124
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,124
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,125
1,"Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,",Industrial Designer,126
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,127
1,but that's not what uh has been asked .,Industrial Designer,128
1,"I know , I know .",Project Manager,129
1,So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,130
1,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,131
1,"Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .",Project Manager,131
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,132
1,Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .,Project Manager,133
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,134
1,Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device .,Project Manager,135
1,"Definitely not , no .",Project Manager,135
1,{vocalsound} It's not that innovative .,Project Manager,135
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,136
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,137
1,Or however you s pronounce that .,Project Manager,138
1,"Yeah , too bad .",User Interface,139
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,139
1,"Um so , okay .",Project Manager,140
1,"{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,",Project Manager,140
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,141
1,this is the wrong one .,Project Manager,142
1,So uh that means redesign .,Project Manager,142
1,{vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .,Project Manager,142
1,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,143
1,Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went .,Project Manager,144
1,Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first .,Project Manager,144
1,I guess {disfmarker},Project Manager,144
1,"Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Marketing,145
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,146
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,146
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,147
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,148
1,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager,149
1,"Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .",Industrial Designer,150
1,We l we can learn .,Project Manager,151
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,151
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,151
1,I agree .,Project Manager,151
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,152
1,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,153
1,Is it fancy ?,Industrial Designer,154
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,154
1,I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,155
1,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,156
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,157
1,Yay .,Marketing,158
1,Is it ?,Marketing,158
1,Is it fancy ?,Marketing,158
1,"Yeah , I think so .",Project Manager,159
1,"Um the yellow rubber , I think so .",User Interface,160
1,I think so .,Industrial Designer,161
1,"{vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo .",Project Manager,162
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,162
1,{vocalsound} I'm into it .,User Interface,163
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,163
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,164
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,165
1,So uh one ?,Marketing,166
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,167
1,But it's not that fancy .,Industrial Designer,168
1,"No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .",Project Manager,169
1,I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing .,Industrial Designer,170
1,It would be even more {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,170
1,You like tita {vocalsound},Project Manager,171
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,172
1,"oh , you really like titanium .",Industrial Designer,173
1,I'm I'm into it .,Industrial Designer,173
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,173
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,174
1,That's a flavour as well .,Project Manager,175
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,176
1,It has flavour .,Industrial Designer,177
1,"Yes , that's right .",Industrial Designer,177
1,{vocalsound} You should taste it .,Industrial Designer,177
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,177
1,{vocalsound} Right .,Project Manager,178
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,178
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,179
1,"Yeah , I know ,",Project Manager,180
1,Is it uh {disfmarker},Marketing,181
1,but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker},Project Manager,182
1,"It has to do with fashion , I guess .",Industrial Designer,183
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,184
1,"It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,185
1,So do {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,186
1,And w,Marketing,187
1,yeah .,User Interface,188
1,"yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials .",Marketing,189
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,190
1,So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy .,Marketing,191
1,It applies .,Project Manager,192
1,It {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,192
1,"Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two .",User Interface,193
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,194
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,195
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,196
1,"It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker}",User Interface,197
1,I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case .,Industrial Designer,198
1,"It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .",Industrial Designer,198
1,"Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,199
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,200
1,"{vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case .",User Interface,201
1,"We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours .",User Interface,201
1,That's two out of three .,User Interface,201
1,So I believe uh we are close uh to two .,User Interface,201
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,202
1,"Yeah , I I agree .",Project Manager,203
1,"Yes , I agree too .",Industrial Designer,204
1,It's okay .,Industrial Designer,204
1,"We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good .",Industrial Designer,204
1,"Okay , and uh was it innovative ?",Marketing,205
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,206
1,"Well ,",Project Manager,207
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,208
1,with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,209
1,But that's not in it .,User Interface,210
1,Ov or can we {disfmarker},User Interface,210
1,Yep .,Marketing,211
1,"No , we are evaluating this this uh design now .",Project Manager,212
1,This prototype .,Project Manager,212
1,"Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product .",Industrial Designer,213
1,Okay .,User Interface,214
1,So I I I think it is .,Industrial Designer,215
1,I think it's innovative .,Industrial Designer,215
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,216
1,{vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel .,User Interface,217
1,"The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think .",User Interface,217
1,No .,Industrial Designer,218
1,"It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,218
1,"Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,219
1,That would have been a thrill .,Project Manager,220
1,"yes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,221
1,So uh also a uh two ?,Marketing,222
1,I think uh it's a two .,Industrial Designer,223
1,Yep .,Project Manager,224
1,Is it easy to use ?,Marketing,225
1,I'm not sure .,Project Manager,226
1,{vocalsound} I'm not sure .,Project Manager,226
1,Yeah .,User Interface,227
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,228
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,229
1,"Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think .",User Interface,230
1,"Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly .",User Interface,230
1,They won't use it .,User Interface,230
1,"{vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control .",Industrial Designer,231
1,What you see here is is the basic part .,Industrial Designer,231
1,"Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .",Industrial Designer,231
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,232
1,That's for a novice user .,Industrial Designer,233
1,"When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .",Industrial Designer,233
1,"So in that in that way it is advanced ,",Industrial Designer,233
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,234
1,and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .,Industrial Designer,235
1,I think {disfmarker} I think a three .,User Interface,236
1,So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,237
1,{vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .,User Interface,238
1,Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well .,Project Manager,239
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,239
1,Well the p the most important function is easy to use .,Marketing,240
1,"The the zapping , channel switching , volume .",Marketing,240
1,But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .,Marketing,240
1,Okay .,Project Manager,241
1,Uh two or three ?,Project Manager,241
1,Three ?,Project Manager,241
1,Wha wh what would be your guess ?,Project Manager,241
1,I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .,Project Manager,241
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,242
1,It's the uh it's it's overall .,Project Manager,243
1,Is the device easy to use ?,Project Manager,243
1,"Yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer,244
1,"You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,",Industrial Designer,244
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,245
1,because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .,Industrial Designer,246
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,247
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,248
1,Um {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,249
1,"After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two .",Industrial Designer,250
1,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,250
1,"Uh Roo , a three ?",Project Manager,251
1,Yep .,User Interface,252
1,Ruud ?,Project Manager,253
1,Good question .,Marketing,254
1,Uh I'll go uh for the two .,Marketing,254
1,Okay .,Project Manager,255
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,255
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,256
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,257
1,"So , it's two , two and three .",Industrial Designer,258
1,Two threes .,Industrial Designer,258
1,So that's ten .,Industrial Designer,258
1,So I could make it e easy ?,Project Manager,259
1,If you make it a four it will be three in general .,User Interface,260
1,"So that's w No , two and a half .",Industrial Designer,261
1,If he makes it a four .,User Interface,262
1,Not a three .,User Interface,262
1,Six and four .,Industrial Designer,263
1,Six and four is ten .,Industrial Designer,263
1,Divided by four is two and a half .,Industrial Designer,263
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,263
1,Darn .,User Interface,264
1,Nee .,User Interface,264
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,265
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,265
1,Hmm ?,Marketing,266
1,Huh ?,Marketing,266
1,Roo .,Project Manager,267
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,267
1,"A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .",User Interface,268
1,Yeah .,Marketing,269
1,I yeah {gap} .,Marketing,269
1,A four and a three together .,User Interface,270
1,{vocalsound} Four ?,Industrial Designer,271
1,"Yeah , you have a two , he has a two .",User Interface,272
1,Three ?,User Interface,272
1,"Yeah ,",Marketing,273
1,Two ?,Industrial Designer,274
1,"two , two , three {disfmarker}",Marketing,275
1,"No ,",Project Manager,276
1,And a three ?,User Interface,277
1,I haven't said anything yet .,Project Manager,278
1,Nee .,User Interface,279
1,I know .,User Interface,279
1,No .,Marketing,280
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,280
1,"Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten .",Project Manager,281
1,Divided by four is two point five .,Project Manager,281
1,Divided by four .,Industrial Designer,282
1,Yes .,User Interface,283
1,So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three .,User Interface,283
1,Then you would make a four .,User Interface,283
1,If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,283
1,But I'm filling in a three .,Project Manager,284
1,That's not even {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,285
1,Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .,Project Manager,286
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,287
1,"But that's not possible to fill in ,",Industrial Designer,288
1,"Yes , it is .",Project Manager,289
1,so we have to round it .,Industrial Designer,290
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,290
1,{vocalsound} Is it easy to find ?,Marketing,291
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,291
1,{vocalsound} I have a veto .,Project Manager,292
1,{vocalsound} Exactly .,Project Manager,292
1,"It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .",Project Manager,292
1,"Yeah ,",User Interface,293
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,294
1,"we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .",User Interface,295
1,It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy .,Industrial Designer,296
1,"Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,297
1,"Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,298
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,299
1,Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,299
1,"I'm here , I'm here .",Project Manager,300
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,300
1,something like that .,Industrial Designer,301
1,"Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here .",Industrial Designer,301
1,So something like that .,Industrial Designer,301
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,302
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,302
1,But even without it {disfmarker},User Interface,303
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,304
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,305
1,"Well , I uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,306
1,"So , I th",Industrial Designer,307
1,"we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .",Project Manager,308
1,Yeah .,User Interface,309
1,Um Sebastian ?,Project Manager,310
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , me too .",Industrial Designer,311
1,Me too .,User Interface,312
1,"Yeah , I agree .",Marketing,313
1,"Right , well .",Project Manager,314
1,The feel of the remote control is spongy .,Project Manager,314
1,"Well , uh",Project Manager,314
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,315
1,it can't be more spongy .,Project Manager,316
1,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,316
1,"Well , it can be .",Industrial Designer,317
1,There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .,Industrial Designer,317
1,Was it one of our options ?,User Interface,318
1,"No , it's not one of our option ,",Industrial Designer,319
1,No .,Marketing,320
1,Uh,Marketing,320
1,"No okay , but but",Project Manager,321
1,"So , in the in {disfmarker}",User Interface,322
1,"but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,323
1,this this was a most spongy option .,Marketing,324
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,324
1,"for the options given , it's the most spongy one .",Project Manager,325
1,"Uh yes ,",Industrial Designer,326
1,Yeah .,User Interface,327
1,"but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think .",Industrial Designer,328
1,Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market .,Industrial Designer,328
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,329
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,329
1,So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy .,Industrial Designer,330
1,They're out there .,Industrial Designer,330
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,330
1,{vocalsound} They're out there .,Project Manager,331
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,331
1,{vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .,User Interface,332
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,333
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,334
1,"Yes , but it's not good enough ,",Industrial Designer,335
1,{vocalsound} I'll give it a one .,Project Manager,336
1,so it's a two .,Industrial Designer,337
1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one .,User Interface,338
1,You take one ?,Industrial Designer,339
1,What do you give it ?,Industrial Designer,339
1,"Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker}",Marketing,340
1,"Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number .",Project Manager,341
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,341
1,but {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing,342
1,Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time .,Project Manager,343
1,"Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .",Marketing,344
1,It will be a one .,User Interface,345
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,345
1,So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .,Marketing,346
1,No no no .,Industrial Designer,347
1,"Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .",Industrial Designer,347
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,347
1,{vocalsound} You are {disfmarker},Project Manager,348
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,349
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,350
1,okay .,Project Manager,351
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,352
1,The remote control offers enough features .,Project Manager,353
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,354
1,"Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?",Project Manager,355
1,"Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot .",Marketing,356
1,So {disfmarker},Marketing,356
1,{vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .,Industrial Designer,357
1,"Yeah , depends .",Marketing,358
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,359
1,You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .,Industrial Designer,360
1,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,361
1,So it's quite advanced .,Industrial Designer,362
1,What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,363
1,"Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits .",User Interface,364
1,"I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .",User Interface,364
1,I think it has .,Project Manager,365
1,Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat,Marketing,366
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,367
1,"Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .",Project Manager,367
1,"So ,",Project Manager,367
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,368
1,"you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .",Project Manager,369
1,Has uh the signals sent to it .,Industrial Designer,370
1,Yeah .,User Interface,371
1,Signal .,Marketing,372
1,"So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .",Project Manager,373
1,So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .,Project Manager,373
1,Absolutely .,Industrial Designer,374
1,"Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .",Project Manager,375
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,376
1,"But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons .",Industrial Designer,376
1,At at least uh forty buttons .,Industrial Designer,376
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,377
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,377
1,So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to .,Industrial Designer,378
1,And this is quite s simple .,Industrial Designer,378
1,Yep .,Project Manager,379
1,You can use your voice to to programme it .,Industrial Designer,380
1,It's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,380
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,381
1,"Okay , um let's give it a number .",Project Manager,381
1,I'll give it uh a one .,Project Manager,381
1,"For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .",Project Manager,381
1,I'll give a two .,User Interface,382
1,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one .",Industrial Designer,383
1,"Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker}",Marketing,384
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,385
1,"I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .",Industrial Designer,385
1,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,386
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,387
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,388
1,"So high quality , low acceptance .",Project Manager,389
1,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,390
1,The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced .,Project Manager,391
1,"But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure .",Project Manager,391
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,392
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,392
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,392
1,D do you agree ?,Project Manager,393
1,"Yes , I agree .",Industrial Designer,394
1,I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,394
1,Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .,Marketing,395
1,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,396
1,Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function .,Project Manager,396
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,396
1,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,397
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,398
1,But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes .,Industrial Designer,399
1,But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ?,User Interface,400
1,Fifty ?,User Interface,400
1,Twenty five Euros .,Project Manager,401
1,Uh twenty five .,User Interface,402
1,And costs were twelve fifty .,User Interface,402
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,403
1,"But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think .",User Interface,404
1,Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ?,User Interface,404
1,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,405
1,So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker},User Interface,406
1,M about fifty Euros .,Industrial Designer,407
1,yeah .,User Interface,408
1,That's quite ex,Industrial Designer,409
1,"That's price , but w w",User Interface,410
1,"well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .",Industrial Designer,411
1,No .,User Interface,412
1,"An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,412
1,"Yes , it's more than fifty Euros .",Industrial Designer,413
1,"It's quite expensive , yes .",Industrial Designer,413
1,"Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .",User Interface,414
1,"Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .",Project Manager,415
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,416
1,"Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .",Industrial Designer,416
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,417
1,And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition,Industrial Designer,418
1,{gap} .,Project Manager,419
1,and this one does .,Industrial Designer,420
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,421
1,So I think it's worth its price .,Industrial Designer,422
1,Okay .,Project Manager,423
1,Um you had an overall rating .,Project Manager,423
1,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,423
1,"Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh",Marketing,424
1,That's counting .,Project Manager,425
1,"Well , it's it's about one point five .",Industrial Designer,426
1,Something like that .,Industrial Designer,426
1,"should be about one point s seven ,",Marketing,427
1,Four six seven eight .,User Interface,428
1,yeah .,Marketing,429
1,Okay .,Project Manager,430
1,Nine divided by six .,User Interface,431
1,Okay .,Project Manager,432
1,Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .,Project Manager,432
1,"About the project itself , not about the product .",Project Manager,432
1,"Um {disfmarker} What did you think about uh the process , the project process ?",Project Manager,432
1,Ruud ?,Project Manager,432
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,433
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,434
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,435
1,{vocalsound} Try to translate that .,Project Manager,436
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,436
1,Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,437
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,438
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,439
1,Hmm .,User Interface,440
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,440
1,"Any any other {disfmarker} Uh , Roo ?",Project Manager,441
1,"Yeah , I think uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,442
1,"Well , I think {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,443
1,Ye,Marketing,444
1,{vocalsound} Roo .,Project Manager,445
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,445
1,{vocalsound} The process was good .,User Interface,446
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,447
1,But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .,User Interface,448
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,449
1,And and that was the the big deal .,User Interface,450
1,"I if we knew that before , we c we could have made",User Interface,450
1,Mm .,Industrial Designer,451
1,"Actually , we had {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,451
1,the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker},User Interface,452
1,Better decision .,Project Manager,453
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,454
1,yeah .,User Interface,455
1,We had we had too little information actually .,Industrial Designer,456
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,457
1,"So {disfmarker} And uh um the the the {disfmarker} well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow .",Industrial Designer,458
1,Less .,Project Manager,459
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,459
1,So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,460
1,So we could we we could be {disfmarker} we could've been creative .,Project Manager,461
1,But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .,Project Manager,461
1,Well {disfmarker} Yes .,Industrial Designer,462
1,The prices .,Marketing,463
1,"Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .",Industrial Designer,464
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,465
1,We we thought of possibilities {vocalsound} who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components .,Industrial Designer,466
1,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,466
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,467
1,"We're tempered by that , yes .",Industrial Designer,468
1,"Okay , Roo ?",Project Manager,469
1,Any other thoughts on that ?,Project Manager,469
1,"No , no .",User Interface,470
1,Ruud ?,Project Manager,471
1,I agree .,Marketing,472
1,"You agree , okay .",Project Manager,473
1,Uh leadership .,Project Manager,473
1,Fantastic .,User Interface,474
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,474
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,475
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,476
1,"{vocalsound} Okay , Roo's on for his promotion .",Project Manager,477
1,{vocalsound},Project Manager,477
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,478
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,479
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,480
1,"Yeah , {gap} okay .",Industrial Designer,481
1,Okay .,Project Manager,482
1,I think we're a good team .,Industrial Designer,483
1,"I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment .",Project Manager,484
1,"I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh {gap} .",Project Manager,484
1,{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,484
1,Yeah .,User Interface,485
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,486
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,487
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,488
1,"{vocalsound} Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed .",Industrial Designer,489
1,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,489
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,490
1,{vocalsound} So um {disfmarker},Project Manager,490
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,491
1,{vocalsound},Marketing,492
1,"Yeah , but but si uh w w w {gap} {disfmarker} when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well .",Project Manager,493
1,I think so too .,Industrial Designer,494
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,495
1,Um,Project Manager,495
1,Yeah .,User Interface,496
1,"the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen .",Project Manager,497
1,Did you like 'em ?,Project Manager,497
1,{vocalsound} Uh .,Industrial Designer,498
1,"The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad .",Industrial Designer,498
1,Yeah .,User Interface,499
1,Because of the response,Project Manager,500
1,It {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,501
1,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,502
1,Response,User Interface,503
1,The response is very slow,Industrial Designer,504
1,and {disfmarker},User Interface,505
1,and the possibilities are very limited .,Industrial Designer,506
1,It's not accurate .,Industrial Designer,506
1,Okay .,Project Manager,507
1,Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,507
1,Uh it it has {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,508
1,"Yeah , it's not accurate .",User Interface,508
1,The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its {disfmarker} um uh where it uh {disfmarker},User Interface,508
1,Draws .,Marketing,509
1,"Yeah , where it draws .",User Interface,510
1,It's uh {disfmarker} the drawing on on the b on the board is {gap} r right from the pen .,User Interface,510
1,"Okay , so",Project Manager,511
1,So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,512
1,"it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ?",Project Manager,513
1,You to take in account that your {disfmarker} you m,User Interface,514
1,Uh yeah .,Project Manager,515
1,yeah uh {disfmarker},User Interface,516
1,Maybe it's {disfmarker} it needs to be calibrateds .,Industrial Designer,517
1,It's too slow {disfmarker},User Interface,518
1,It it was calibrated just before this meeting .,Project Manager,519
1,"Uh the one before , the third meeting .",Project Manager,519
1,It is ?,Industrial Designer,520
1,"So uh it's not the calibration ,",Project Manager,521
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,522
1,"it's the thing itself , I think .",Project Manager,523
1,Hmm .,User Interface,524
1,Okay .,Industrial Designer,525
1,"Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ?",Project Manager,526
1,Or not at all ?,Project Manager,526
1,No .,Marketing,527
1,Not at all .,Project Manager,528
1,Not really .,Marketing,529
1,Okay .,Project Manager,530
1,"I thought it was quite a handy uh thing ,",Project Manager,530
1,I I think so too .,Industrial Designer,531
1,although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .,Project Manager,532
1,Yep .,User Interface,533
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,534
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,534
1,"If it has O_C_R_ {vocalsound} , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it .",User Interface,535
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,536
1,It w it w yeah .,User Interface,537
1,It was necessary for me to uh {disfmarker},User Interface,537
1,To digitise them .,Project Manager,538
1,"Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it .",User Interface,539
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,540
1,I type faster than I write .,User Interface,541
1,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,542
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,543
1,So {disfmarker},User Interface,544
1,"But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .",Industrial Designer,545
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,546
1,Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy {disfmarker} it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .,Industrial Designer,547
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,548
1,I think it's a good product .,Industrial Designer,549
1,I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big .,Industrial Designer,549
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,550
1,It's not quite uh ergonomic .,Industrial Designer,551
1,Eco ergonomic .,Industrial Designer,551
1,Economic .,User Interface,552
1,I know .,Project Manager,553
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,554
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,555
1,Okay .,Project Manager,555
1,"Um {disfmarker} What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?",Project Manager,555
1,"Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit ,",Marketing,556
1,Yeah .,Project Manager,557
1,"Okay , you can't really decide .",Project Manager,557
1,No .,Project Manager,557
1,{vocalsound},User Interface,558
1,so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can't say much about it .,Marketing,559
1,I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops .,Project Manager,560
1,"I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or {disfmarker}",Project Manager,560
1,Yeah .,User Interface,561
1,Yes .,Industrial Designer,562
1,"No , or the other way around .",Marketing,563
1,"Or the other way around , that you could show {disfmarker} but m",Project Manager,564
1,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,565
1,But y you can {disfmarker},User Interface,566
1,That's quite what PowerPoint does .,Industrial Designer,567
1,Yeah .,Marketing,568
1,I know .,Project Manager,569
1,"if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .",User Interface,570
1,"I know , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,571
1,So it's almost {disfmarker},User Interface,572
1,"I know , but we couldn't use that feature ,",Project Manager,573
1,yeah .,User Interface,574
1,so I missed it .,Project Manager,575
1,Yep .,User Interface,576
1,We weren't able to do that .,Project Manager,577
1,At least the {disfmarker} um I wasn't explained how to do such a th,Project Manager,577
1,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,578

1,Yeah .,Project Manager,585
1,And a lot of these buttons don't appear here .,Industrial Designer,586
1,So it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,586

2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,17
2,"Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well .",Industrial Designer,18
2,I th I I think {disfmarker} yeah um .,Project Manager,19
2,Mm .,Marketing,20
2,"This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .",Project Manager,21
2,Etcetera .,Industrial Designer,22
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,23
2,"So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it .",Project Manager,24
2,Um the minutes from the last time .,Project Manager,24
2,"Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .",Project Manager,24
2,"Um we have decided on a {disfmarker} leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal .",Project Manager,24
2,"We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um .",Project Manager,24
2,You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries,Project Manager,24
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,25
2,"and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,",Project Manager,26
2,{gap},User Interface,27
2,"things like that ,",Project Manager,28
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,29
2,"um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .",Project Manager,30
2,'Kay .,User Interface,31
2,"Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?",Project Manager,32
2,Shall I ?,Marketing,33
2,Yep .,User Interface,34
2,Yes if you feel {disfmarker},Project Manager,35
2,Okay .,Marketing,36
2,We just connect up .,Marketing,36
2,{gap},Project Manager,37
2,Thank you .,Marketing,38
2,There we go .,Marketing,38
2,Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .,Marketing,38
2,"Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,",Marketing,38
2,{vocalsound},User Interface,39
2,It's okay {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,40
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,41
2,sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} .,Marketing,42
2,Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later .,Marketing,42
2,So that was one of the first things we did .,Marketing,42
2,"Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .",Marketing,42
2,"{vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .",Marketing,42
2,"They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .",Marketing,42
2,"Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .",Marketing,42
2,"So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .",Marketing,42
2,Yeah .,Project Manager,43
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .",Marketing,44
2,So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?,Marketing,44
2,"There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .",Marketing,44
2,"So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan .",Marketing,44
2,Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .,Marketing,44
2,'Kay .,User Interface,45
2,Okay thank you very much .,Project Manager,46
2,Um,Project Manager,46
2,Yep .,User Interface,47
2,let's start from the inside and work our way out .,Project Manager,48
2,Fine .,User Interface,49
2,It's okay with me .,User Interface,49
2,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,50
2,{gap},Industrial Designer,50
2,Unless anyone has any questions about that ?,Marketing,51
2,"I don't think so , not yet .",Project Manager,52
2,Not yet ?,Marketing,53
2,'Kay .,Marketing,53
2,"Um , yes , thank you .",Project Manager,54
2,That screwed in ?,Industrial Designer,55
2,{gap},Industrial Designer,55
2,Okay .,Marketing,56
2,I hate those little things,Project Manager,57
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,58
2,especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .,Project Manager,59
2,{vocalsound} I know .,Marketing,60
2,"'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,61
2,Okay .,Project Manager,62
2,Okay .,Industrial Designer,63
2,Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .,Industrial Designer,63
2,"Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method .",Industrial Designer,63
2,The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .,Industrial Designer,63
2,"Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .",Industrial Designer,63
2,'Kay .,Project Manager,64
2,{vocalsound} .,Project Manager,64
2,"Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there .",Industrial Designer,65
2,"This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .",Industrial Designer,65
2,'Kay .,Project Manager,66
2,Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .,Industrial Designer,67
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,68
2,"There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,",Industrial Designer,69
2,Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?,Project Manager,70
2,people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .,Industrial Designer,71
2,"Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .",Project Manager,72
2,So you wind up your remote control before you use it .,Industrial Designer,73
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,74
2,"How {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what kind of {disfmarker} how l long can you get out of that ,",Project Manager,75
2,It might {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,76
2,I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ?,Project Manager,77
2,Or {disfmarker},Project Manager,77
2,"You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,78
2,That doesn't count though does it ?,Project Manager,79
2,Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?,Marketing,80
2,I thought it was U_V_ like {disfmarker},Project Manager,81
2,No .,Industrial Designer,82
2,Artificial light ?,Marketing,83
2,Is it ?,Industrial Designer,84
2,Alright i,Industrial Designer,84
2,"Any , any {disfmarker}",Project Manager,85
2,Has to be solar .,Marketing,86
2,Yep .,User Interface,87
2,"Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or {disfmarker} and dynamo might take more space .",User Interface,87
2,Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .,Industrial Designer,88
2,I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .,Project Manager,89
2,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,90
2,"Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights",Project Manager,91
2,Mm .,Marketing,92
2,"Artificial light , no .",Marketing,92
2,"no , but I mean not many {disfmarker} you don't want to limit your market .",Project Manager,93
2,That's going to {disfmarker},Marketing,94
2,"I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .",Project Manager,95
2,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,96
2,"I know ,",Marketing,97
2,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,98
2,"different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .",Marketing,99
2,Yeah,Industrial Designer,100
2,Right .,User Interface,101
2,and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .,Industrial Designer,102
2,Night .,User Interface,103
2,"Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .",Project Manager,104
2,But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .,Industrial Designer,105
2,Okay .,Project Manager,106
2,The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches,Industrial Designer,107
2,Yeah I've seen {disfmarker},Project Manager,108
2,and you d you don't even notice it .,Industrial Designer,109
2,"I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .",Industrial Designer,109
2,"And are these like uh {disfmarker} what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?",User Interface,110
2,"Um yeah it's {disfmarker} it charges into um some form of {disfmarker} it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,",Industrial Designer,111
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,112
2,'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .,Industrial Designer,113
2,Okay .,User Interface,114
2,And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out {gap} .,Industrial Designer,115
2,We c,User Interface,116
2,"But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time",Project Manager,117
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,118
2,"so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time .",Project Manager,119
2,If you'd {disfmarker},Project Manager,119
2,Yeah and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,120
2,"I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .",Project Manager,121
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,122
2,Yeah but then again,Industrial Designer,123
2,Is it really gonna be enough ?,Project Manager,124
2,"I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .",Industrial Designer,125
2,Okay .,Project Manager,126
2,"And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it",Industrial Designer,127
2,So it's not {disfmarker} the draw on it isn't {disfmarker},Project Manager,128
2,and you put it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,129
2,Hmm .,Marketing,130
2,no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,131
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,132
2,Mm .,Marketing,132
2,Okay .,Project Manager,133
2,"Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?",Marketing,134
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,135
2,"I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging",Marketing,136
2,Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing,Industrial Designer,137
2,or the two things not compatible ?,Marketing,138
2,Like a dual kind of .,Project Manager,139
2,"but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .",Industrial Designer,140
2,Mm .,Marketing,141
2,So that affects the exterior design .,Marketing,141
2,Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .,User Interface,142
2,Expensive as well .,Project Manager,143
2,What kind of price are we looking at for {disfmarker},Project Manager,143
2,"They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,144
2,It's twelve point f,User Interface,145
2,I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?,Project Manager,146
2,"Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the {disfmarker} It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,",Industrial Designer,147
2,Solar .,Project Manager,148
2,'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y,Industrial Designer,149
2,Well they're not designed {disfmarker},Project Manager,150
2,"the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .",Industrial Designer,151
2,Practical-wise okay .,Project Manager,152
2,"Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically .",Industrial Designer,153
2,"I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,",Industrial Designer,153
2,You do get a bit of wear,Project Manager,154
2,they can t,Industrial Designer,155
2,but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?,Project Manager,156
2,"Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .",Industrial Designer,157
2,Mm .,Project Manager,158
2,Mm .,Marketing,159
2,Another question is like {disfmarker},User Interface,160
2,Again it de,Marketing,161
2,sorry .,User Interface,162
2,"W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .",User Interface,162
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,163
2,"A remote control , like ,",User Interface,164
2,W m yeah,Industrial Designer,165
2,so we have to s look at the life also .,User Interface,166
2,Mm .,Marketing,167
2,"so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .",Industrial Designer,168
2,"It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,",Marketing,169
2,"Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .",Industrial Designer,170
2,"i {vocalsound} it's not gonna add anything , okay .",Marketing,171
2,"Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?",Project Manager,172
2,Okay .,User Interface,173
2,Can we think about that ?,Project Manager,174
2,'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,174
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,175
2,Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker},Marketing,176
2,Well add it in to think about um,Project Manager,177
2,"right , okay .",Marketing,178
2,"because , where am I ?",Project Manager,179
2,If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,179
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,180
2,"we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .",Project Manager,181
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,182
2,But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than,Project Manager,183
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,184
2,the eternal battle for control of the controls .,Project Manager,185
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,186
2,"It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,",Marketing,187
2,No .,Project Manager,188
2,it's not a thing that people are looking for,Marketing,189
2,Okay .,Project Manager,190
2,So {disfmarker},User Interface,191
2,when we threw it open to the field yeah .,Marketing,192
2,Okay .,Industrial Designer,193
2,But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .,Marketing,194
2,"Okay , right .",Project Manager,195
2,"Okay , well I'll move on .",Industrial Designer,196
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,197
2,"Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .",Industrial Designer,198
2,What kind of things do we have to consider there ?,Project Manager,199
2,"Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,199
2,Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in .,Industrial Designer,200
2,"If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,",Industrial Designer,200
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,201
2,Okay .,Project Manager,201
2,"if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit",Industrial Designer,202
2,Okay .,Project Manager,203
2,"so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used .",Industrial Designer,204
2,"Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,",Industrial Designer,204
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,205
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,206
2,"but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .",Industrial Designer,207
2,Okay .,User Interface,208
2,"Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing",Industrial Designer,209
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,210
2,and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical .,Industrial Designer,211
2,"Titanium um very expensive just to process ,",Industrial Designer,211
2,Mm .,Project Manager,212
2,"which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,",Industrial Designer,213
2,Mm .,Marketing,214
2,"but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer,215
2,Okay .,Marketing,216
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,217
2,I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said .,Industrial Designer,218
2,Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case .,Industrial Designer,218
2,"If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes .",Industrial Designer,218
2,But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units,Industrial Designer,218
2,Second thing is {disfmarker},User Interface,219
2,"Hinged , yeah .",Project Manager,220
2,for the flip phone .,Industrial Designer,221
2,"yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .",User Interface,222
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,223
2,"So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .",User Interface,224
2,Mm .,Marketing,225
2,"So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,",User Interface,226
2,Yeah I th,Industrial Designer,227
2,or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker},User Interface,228
2,Uh .,Industrial Designer,229
2,"Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,229
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,230
2,"it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,231
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,232
2,it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .,Industrial Designer,233
2,It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall .,Marketing,234
2,I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .,Marketing,234
2,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,235
2,"I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,",Marketing,236
2,"Rubber , yeah .",Industrial Designer,237
2,"that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .",Marketing,238
2,And you can peel them off yeah .,Industrial Designer,239
2,Yeah .,User Interface,240
2,"So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,",Project Manager,241
2,"Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .",Marketing,242
2,Something like {disfmarker},User Interface,243
2,"like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .",Project Manager,244
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,245
2,Alright .,User Interface,246
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,247
2,Mm .,Marketing,248
2,That could be a good idea .,User Interface,249
2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,250
2,Mm .,Marketing,251
2,It could {disfmarker} it would be comfortable to hold on also .,User Interface,252
2,Okay .,Project Manager,253
2,Mm .,Project Manager,253
2,T,Industrial Designer,254
2,Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .,Marketing,255
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,256
2,Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .,Project Manager,257
2,Mm .,Marketing,258
2,Yeah .,Marketing,258
2,Also the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,259
2,'Kay .,Project Manager,260
2,"just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the {disfmarker} I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .",Industrial Designer,261
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,262
2,"Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option .",Industrial Designer,263
2,"Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch",Industrial Designer,263
2,"Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}",User Interface,264
2,display .,Industrial Designer,265
2,Uh what what {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,265
2,"Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}",User Interface,266
2,Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,267
2,Uh-huh .,User Interface,268
2,"the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,",Industrial Designer,269
2,Okay .,User Interface,270
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,271
2,"but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .",Industrial Designer,272
2,Mm .,Marketing,273
2,With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,274
2,"I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}",Marketing,275
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,276
2,Oh it would be flat inside .,Project Manager,277
2,"You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,",Industrial Designer,278
2,"yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .",Marketing,279
2,Mm .,Project Manager,280
2,but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .,Industrial Designer,281
2,Have I misunderstood you ?,Marketing,282
2,"It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,",Industrial Designer,283
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,284
2,"but there'd be touch touch buttons ,",Industrial Designer,285
2,'Kay .,User Interface,286
2,"so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .",Industrial Designer,287
2,"I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .",Project Manager,288
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,289
2,Is rubber .,Industrial Designer,290
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,290
2,Yeah .,Marketing,291
2,"Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}",Project Manager,292
2,Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .,Industrial Designer,293
2,Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,294
2,"I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ .",Marketing,295
2,"{vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .",Marketing,295
2,"Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out",Industrial Designer,296
2,Like one of the palm pop thing .,Project Manager,297
2,"but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,",Industrial Designer,298
2,Mm .,Marketing,299
2,"Absolutely , f for somebody who {gap} very often , if he would {disfmarker}",User Interface,300
2,'cause I had {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,301
2,Yeah .,Marketing,302
2,It would have to be attached .,Project Manager,303
2,"They're easy to replace as well , cheap .",Marketing,304
2,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,305
2,a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a {gap},User Interface,306
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,307
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,307
2,"and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .",User Interface,308
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,309
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,310
2,Mm .,Marketing,311
2,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,312
2,"Yeah just a thought {disfmarker} they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ?",Marketing,313
2,"A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a {disfmarker}",Marketing,313
2,"Okay , we'll talk about that {disfmarker} so if you finish your {disfmarker}",Project Manager,314
2,Yeah that's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,315
2,and we'll come back to that .,Project Manager,316
2,yeah that {disfmarker} that's the end of m my {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,317
2,"That's you , right okay .",Project Manager,318
2,"And just one small question before like you are {gap} , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons",User Interface,319
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,320
2,"like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .",User Interface,321
2,Uh yeah .,Industrial Designer,322
2,"Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,",Industrial Designer,322
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,323
2,"I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate {disfmarker} you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,",Industrial Designer,324
2,Okay .,User Interface,325
2,Okay .,User Interface,325
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,326
2,'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .,Industrial Designer,327
2,"I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .",Marketing,328
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,329
2,"If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?",Marketing,330
2,No .,Project Manager,331
2,And they kind of respond to the turn of your body .,Marketing,332
2,Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display {disfmarker} th uh the remote control display thing .,Marketing,332
2,We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .,Project Manager,333
2,Um .,Industrial Designer,334
2,They don't look at themselves ?,Marketing,335
2,Just a thought .,Marketing,335
2,"Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager,336
2,Yeah .,Marketing,337
2,"I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}",Marketing,337
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,338
2,"it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .",Marketing,339
2,"Yeah , no , no .",Project Manager,340
2,{gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much,Marketing,341
2,Mm .,Project Manager,342
2,but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .,Marketing,343
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,344
2,Okay .,Project Manager,345
2,'Kay .,Marketing,346
2,"I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,",Industrial Designer,347
2,Mm .,Marketing,348
2,"but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,349
2,Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror,Marketing,350
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , okay .",Project Manager,351
2,that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .,Marketing,352
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,353
2,"Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here .",User Interface,354
2,"First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .",User Interface,354
2,"Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here .",User Interface,354
2,"So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .",User Interface,354
2,Mm .,Project Manager,355
2,"So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .",User Interface,356
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,357
2,And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here .,User Interface,358
2,No particular remote is standard .,User Interface,358
2,Mm .,Project Manager,359
2,"Like , some some people have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Here you see this ?",User Interface,360
2,"This is on a {disfmarker} I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .",User Interface,360
2,Okay .,Project Manager,361
2,"Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top",User Interface,362
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,363
2,and g graphic user interface,User Interface,364
2,Sorry what does that stand for ?,Marketing,365
2,Which means {disfmarker},Project Manager,366
2,"basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,",User Interface,367
2,Okay .,Marketing,368
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,369
2,which is {disfmarker},User Interface,370
2,If you if {disfmarker} yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .,Industrial Designer,371
2,Like you have on a l uh {disfmarker} icons or something y you have {disfmarker} is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .,User Interface,372
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,373
2,Okay .,Project Manager,374
2,"So basically {gap} not point or click {gap} {disfmarker} Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .",User Interface,375
2,Okay .,Project Manager,376
2,"And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button .",User Interface,377
2,So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .,User Interface,377
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,378
2,"So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .",User Interface,379
2,Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?,Project Manager,380
2,{gap},User Interface,381
2,"'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .",Project Manager,382
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,383
2,No you'd hold it {disfmarker} you don't {disfmarker} if you flip it open then you'd be {disfmarker} Wouldn't you ?,Marketing,384
2,Isn't that the idea ?,Marketing,384
2,"You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah .",Marketing,384
2,Yeah .,Project Manager,385
2,"That's what I was just saying ,",Project Manager,385
2,"Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li",Industrial Designer,386
2,But {disfmarker},User Interface,387
2,and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top,Project Manager,388
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,389
2,"and then be able to touch that for the {vocalsound} other controls ,",Project Manager,390
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,391
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,391
2,Okay and you mean to the {disfmarker},User Interface,392
2,"so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that ,",Project Manager,393
2,And the lower distance .,User Interface,394
2,on the lower side .,Project Manager,395
2,Oh f perfect .,User Interface,396
2,Okay .,Project Manager,397
2,Hmm .,Marketing,398
2,So the findings are too many cluttered buttons .,User Interface,399
2,"Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .",User Interface,399
2,All are confusing and in inconsistent .,User Interface,399
2,"Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .",User Interface,399
2,"We have to check into the {disfmarker} for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it {disfmarker} this at a low cost , but for {disfmarker} like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .",User Interface,399
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,400
2,"So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .",User Interface,401
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,402
2,Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound,User Interface,403
2,Mm .,Marketing,404
2,and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh {disfmarker} you can say trendy also ?,User Interface,405
2,And technologically innovative also .,User Interface,405
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,406
2,So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this .,User Interface,407
2,"My personal preferences would be like , as already {gap} uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh",User Interface,407
2,Mm .,Marketing,408
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,409
2,"tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh",User Interface,410
2,"Well , yeah we {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,411
2,"I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern",User Interface,412
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,413
2,because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .,User Interface,414
2,"I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ?",Project Manager,415
2,"This is central one , the one you {disfmarker}",User Interface,416
2,Or is that volume and channel ?,Project Manager,417
2,yeah volume and channel .,User Interface,418
2,"So keep that m {disfmarker} that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here .",User Interface,418
2,This and voice recognition .,User Interface,418
2,Okay .,Project Manager,419
2,Right .,Project Manager,419
2,Okay .,Project Manager,419
2,"Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed .",Project Manager,419
2,"So , we agree on {disfmarker} Do we agree on the battery ?",Project Manager,419
2,The kinetic .,User Interface,420
2,Kinetic ?,Marketing,421
2,Yeah .,Project Manager,422
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,423
2,"Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having {disfmarker}",Project Manager,424
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,425
2,so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .,Project Manager,426
2,Yeah I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,427
2,"It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a",Project Manager,428
2,I mean if {disfmarker} Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have,Industrial Designer,429
2,selling point .,Project Manager,430
2,"and also if they've got it {disfmarker} if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them ,",Industrial Designer,431
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,432
2,uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them .,Industrial Designer,433
2,"So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ?",Industrial Designer,433
2,I think that would be quite fun .,Industrial Designer,433
2,I think the only,Project Manager,434
2,Mm .,Marketing,435
2,"I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,",Project Manager,436
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,437
2,but I think pretty much we've used cheap {disfmarker} relatively cheap and simple things .,Project Manager,438
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,439
2,Mm .,Marketing,440
2,The L_C_D_'s not cheap .,Project Manager,441
2,"Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one ,",Industrial Designer,442
2,Hmm .,Marketing,443
2,I mean they use them in calculators so .,Industrial Designer,444
2,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,445
2,Maybe we could start with the black and white .,User Interface,446
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,447
2,That that way we could upgrade later {gap} .,User Interface,448
2,And you could {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,449
2,Okay .,Project Manager,449
2,"Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,",Marketing,450
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,451
2,Mm .,User Interface,452
2,"we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?",Marketing,453
2,Mm .,User Interface,454
2,Well you cou um .,Industrial Designer,455
2,Do you want like a back-up ?,Project Manager,456
2,"No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?",Marketing,457
2,K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch {disfmarker} a battery that goes in a watch .,Industrial Designer,458
2,I oh I see .,Marketing,459
2,"Right , okay , got you .",Marketing,459
2,"So it's a lot smaller , so it would {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,460
2,"Got you on that okay , didn't realise .",Marketing,461
2,"Um , okay so we've got battery .",Project Manager,462
2,The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?,Project Manager,462
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,463
2,Yeah .,User Interface,464
2,"So there's not a {disfmarker} really a decision to be made there , um .",Project Manager,465
2,The buttons {disfmarker} what did you give us as our {disfmarker} The bare-board L_C_D_ or {disfmarker},Project Manager,465
2,"Yeah the {disfmarker} well I think were {disfmarker} we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons ,",Industrial Designer,466
2,{gap},User Interface,467
2,on the on the on on the top one we're gonna,Industrial Designer,468
2,On the top one okay you've got the touch,Project Manager,469
2,{disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer,470
2,okay and then {disfmarker},Project Manager,471
2,"On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .",Industrial Designer,472
2,"{vocalsound} Okay , okay .",Project Manager,473
2,Sorry could you repeat that last part ?,Marketing,474
2,"Um , okay on {disfmarker} we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .",Industrial Designer,475
2,L_C_D_ screen .,Marketing,476
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,476
2,Okay .,Marketing,476
2,And for the {disfmarker} sorry .,User Interface,477
2,"No , it's fine .",Project Manager,478
2,"For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah",User Interface,479
2,"Plastic ,",Industrial Designer,480
2,"we could use the body ,",User Interface,481
2,For the inside .,Project Manager,482
2,okay .,Industrial Designer,483
2,"for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .",User Interface,484
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,485
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,486
2,"Mm-hmm ,",Marketing,487
2,{gap},User Interface,488
2,"so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,",Marketing,489
2,Plast right .,User Interface,490
2,"{vocalsound} Oh I think so , I think so .",Project Manager,491
2,okay .,Marketing,492
2,"and it is just uh {disfmarker} although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,",Marketing,492
2,Mm no .,Industrial Designer,493
2,No I think I {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Project Manager,494
2,just go for the colours .,Marketing,495
2,It's {disfmarker},User Interface,496
2,we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway,Project Manager,497
2,Okay .,Marketing,498
2,"um the fact {disfmarker} the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes ,",Project Manager,499
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,500
2,"but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know {disfmarker}",Project Manager,501
2,The feel .,Marketing,502
2,yes .,Project Manager,503
2,So we could just pick anything .,Project Manager,503
2,'Kay .,Marketing,504
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,504
2,"Is that going to be {disfmarker} this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy .",Marketing,504
2,"Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,",Marketing,504
2,Uh I {disfmarker} it's different .,User Interface,505
2,It's just different,Project Manager,506
2,is that fancy {gap} ?,Marketing,507
2,"it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses ,",Project Manager,508
2,Mm .,Marketing,509
2,sort of beige and black,Project Manager,510
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,511
2,"um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway ,",Project Manager,512
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,513
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,513
2,or you want something that contrasts as {vocalsound} you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and {disfmarker},Project Manager,514
2,Mm .,Industrial Designer,515
2,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,516
2,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,516
2,"I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree .",Marketing,516
2,"We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things .",Marketing,516
2,Mm .,Project Manager,517
2,"This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more {disfmarker}",Marketing,518
2,"And you would just have an {disfmarker} across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little {disfmarker}",Project Manager,519
2,"Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming {disfmarker} I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,",Marketing,520
2,Mm .,Project Manager,521
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,522
2,Right .,User Interface,523
2,And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes {vocalsound},Project Manager,524
2,which is another beauty of it .,Marketing,525
2,"y you know , you could just go so far with it ,",Project Manager,526
2,You can you can just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,527
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,528
2,"Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .",User Interface,529
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,530
2,"like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever ,",Project Manager,531
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,532
2,so I think that's quite a flexible thing .,Project Manager,533
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,534
2,"And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case {disfmarker} casing {disfmarker} the case outside ,",User Interface,535
2,Yes .,Project Manager,536
2,it should be moulded {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} the design in such a way you can change it every time .,User Interface,537
2,"Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca",Industrial Designer,538
2,Mm .,Project Manager,539
2,"not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .",Industrial Designer,540
2,Okay .,User Interface,541
2,The rubber .,User Interface,541
2,Yeah .,Project Manager,542
2,"Okay we've got five minutes , {vocalsound} um , or that might've been up for a while .",Project Manager,542
2,Fine .,User Interface,543
2,"Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah ,",Marketing,544
2,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,545
2,Yeah .,User Interface,546
2,"{vocalsound} for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic .",Marketing,547
2,"That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?",Marketing,547
2,"Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also",User Interface,548
2,Mm .,Marketing,549
2,because that {disfmarker} we are not {gap} for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost .,User Interface,550
2,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,551
2,"So , are we looking at voice {gap} ?",User Interface,552
2,"Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost ,",Marketing,553
2,Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .,User Interface,554
2,is that right ?,Marketing,555
2,"For l yeah , the whistle .",User Interface,556
2,"Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah .",Industrial Designer,557
2,So we can {disfmarker} if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .,User Interface,558
2,And incorporating the company logo ?,Marketing,559
2,Yep .,User Interface,560
2,Have you {disfmarker},Project Manager,561
2,"Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design .",User Interface,562
2,Mm .,Marketing,563
2,Okay .,Project Manager,564
2,"'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product",Marketing,565
2,"Well they do ,",Project Manager,566
2,don't they ?,Marketing,567
2,but I think we can {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,568
2,Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .,Marketing,569
2,"well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising .",Project Manager,570
2,Yeah .,Marketing,571
2,"Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is",Project Manager,572
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,573
2,and that does the work for you .,Project Manager,574
2,Okay .,Marketing,575
2,"Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it .",Project Manager,576
2,"The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that",Project Manager,576
2,Okay .,Marketing,577
2,so I'm not worried about that .,Project Manager,578
2,Okay .,Marketing,579
2,"Did we {disfmarker} I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?",Marketing,579
2,Depending on how i {vocalsound},Project Manager,580
2,"Yeah , depending on the expense of it .",Industrial Designer,581
2,"I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so",Project Manager,582
2,"And they've got in stock , so yeah .",Industrial Designer,583
2,"um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about .",Project Manager,584
2,But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards .,Project Manager,584
2,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,585
2,Right I'm going to wrap it up there .,Project Manager,586
2,Okay .,Industrial Designer,587
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,588
2,Fine .,User Interface,589
2,I got a end meeting now message on my mo,Project Manager,590
2,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,591
2,{vocalsound},Marketing,592
2,yeah,Project Manager,593
2,Did it ?,Industrial Designer,594
2,Yeah .,User Interface,595
2,{vocalsound} so .,Project Manager,596
2,Um,Project Manager,596
2,Again a questionnaire huh ?,User Interface,597
2,"so I think we've probably got {disfmarker} it says , closing we have forty minutes",Project Manager,598
2,You got to go through .,Marketing,599
2,so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back .,Project Manager,600
2,{vocalsound},User Interface,601
2,It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took {gap} .,Project Manager,602
2,I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now .,User Interface,603
2,{vocalsound} Is everyone happy ?,Project Manager,604
2,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,604
3,So we can start ?,Project Manager,1
3,Yeah .,Marketing,2
3,Suppose I have to do my presentation .,Project Manager,3
3,{vocalsound} Eh um {vocalsound},Project Manager,3
3,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer,4
3,It's Ada Longmund ?,Industrial Designer,4
3,"{vocalsound} So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager .",Project Manager,5
3,So um we will have to um speak about m the project .,Project Manager,5
3,"Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .",Project Manager,5
3,Record .,Project Manager,5
3,So the project method is the following .,Project Manager,5
3,"So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other .",Project Manager,5
3,Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .,Project Manager,5
3,Uh .,Project Manager,5
3,{vocalsound},Marketing,6
3,"The tool training is to try out the white board , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,7
3,"Maybe someone ha we have to {gap} this whiteboard ,",Industrial Designer,8
3,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,9
3,yeah ?,Industrial Designer,10
3,{vocalsound},Marketing,11
3,Maybe you can draw your favourite animal,Project Manager,12
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,13
3,and make a list of its favourite characteristics .,Project Manager,14
3,So right now ?,Marketing,15
3,"I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .",Project Manager,16
3,So yeah I think you can do it .,User Interface,17
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,17
3,"Yeah , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,18
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,19
3,So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros .,Project Manager,20
3,{vocalsound},Project Manager,20
3,Twenty five Euros ?,User Interface,21
3,Yeah .,Project Manager,22
3,Yeah .,Project Manager,22
3,{vocalsound},Project Manager,22
3,Mm .,Marketing,23
3,"I think it's quite good price , yeah .",Project Manager,24
3,"I it's it's reasonable , s quite {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer,25
3,Twenty five .,Industrial Designer,25
3,"It's reasonable , I think , yeah .",Marketing,26
3,And uh,Project Manager,27
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,28
3,"it will uh be a an international remote control ,",Project Manager,29
3,Is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,30
3,"as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes .",Project Manager,31
3,"So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um {disfmarker} with the remote control .",Project Manager,31
3,"Um just uh maybe be imaginative with {vocalsound} remote const con controls ,",Project Manager,31
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,32
3,{vocalsound},Marketing,33
3,try to create something new and people would like to to buy .,Project Manager,34
3,"And {vocalsound} and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know {disfmarker} I suppose you know what you have to do .",Project Manager,34
3,{vocalsound},Project Manager,34
3,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,35
3,I I hope so {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,35
3,And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .,Project Manager,36
3,"Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think .",Marketing,37
3,AMI,Marketing,37
3,Yeah .,Project Manager,38
3,Yep .,User Interface,39
3,and {disfmarker},Marketing,40
3,"I_D_ ,",Project Manager,41
3,okay .,Marketing,42
3,yeah .,Project Manager,43
3,Yeah .,User Interface,44
3,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,45
3,"I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ?",Industrial Designer,46
3,Okay .,Marketing,47
3,"And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer ,",Industrial Designer,48
3,That's me .,User Interface,49
3,"Okay ,",Marketing,50
3,yeah ?,Industrial Designer,51
3,"and Marketing Expert , it's me .",Marketing,52
3,AMI yeah project .,Industrial Designer,53

3,"You can manage all this , yeah .",Marketing,56
3,Okay .,User Interface,57
3,Good .,Marketing,58
3,So you have questions ?,Project Manager,59
3,Um .,Marketing,60

3,{vocalsound} So,Project Manager,61
3,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,62
3,you all know what the parts of the work you have to do .,Project Manager,63
3,"So which {disfmarker} you , the Industrial Designer .",Marketing,64
3,No I'm user interf I'm user interface design .,User Interface,65
3,"I am the Industrial Design , yeah",Industrial Designer,66
3,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,67
3,Okay .,Marketing,68
3,And you ?,Project Manager,69
3,I am the Industrial Designer so .,Industrial Designer,70
3,Mm okay .,Project Manager,71
3,Okay .,User Interface,72
3,So what's the difference between,User Interface,72
3,Yeah .,Marketing,73
3,user interface design d industrial design ?,User Interface,74
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,74
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,75
3,Hmm .,Project Manager,76
3,"I mean , you have to know .",Marketing,77
3,"Ah , you have to know it .",Marketing,77
3,{vocalsound},Project Manager,78
3,{vocalsound} It's difficult .,Industrial Designer,79
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,79
3,"It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is .",Marketing,80
3,You know very soon .,Industrial Designer,81
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,81
3,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,82
3,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,83
3,Mm .,Marketing,84
3,I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .,Project Manager,85
3,"Okay , so I make uh u user interface .",User Interface,86
3,Yeah .,Marketing,87
3,You you de you implement the core functions in the {disfmarker},User Interface,88
3,And i maybe you will transform it {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,89
3,I I think the user the user interface design is {disfmarker} he will design how the user will you know {disfmarker} the relation between the user and you know the remote control so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,90
3,Use it .,User Interface,91
3,Make make {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,91
3,"And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .",Industrial Designer,92
3,"Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design .",User Interface,93
3,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,94
3,So the materi,Industrial Designer,94
3,"I design the user f user interface , you design the function .",User Interface,95
3,"Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .",Project Manager,96
3,Yeah .,User Interface,97
3,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing,98
3,Okay .,User Interface,99
3,Okay right .,Industrial Designer,100
3,"But {disfmarker} I was thinking that he's a user {disfmarker} 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .",Industrial Designer,100
3,Yeah yeah .,User Interface,101
3,But I don't know .,Industrial Designer,102
3,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,102
3,Well .,Marketing,103
3,You know .,Marketing,103
3,I'm the industrial designer .,Industrial Designer,104
3,"Oh , okay , okay .",Marketing,105
3,Not the other one .,Marketing,105
3,So .,Industrial Designer,106
3,Okay .,User Interface,107
3,Okay .,Industrial Designer,108
3,So and the marketing expert will {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,108
3,"Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have",Marketing,109
3,And {disfmarker},Project Manager,110
3,and then thi this would {vocalsound} I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .,Marketing,111
3,yeah .,Project Manager,112
3,Ok Okay .,Industrial Designer,113
3,And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product .,Project Manager,114
3,"So you don't have to do something really specific ,",Project Manager,114
3,Okay .,User Interface,115
3,"as everybody everybody will have to use it ,",Project Manager,116
3,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,117
3,Mm .,Marketing,118
3,it's sor the same as keyboards .,Project Manager,119
3,"You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard ,",Project Manager,119
3,Yeah .,User Interface,120
3,Mm .,User Interface,120
3,so really the remote control to be international .,Project Manager,121
3,Yeah .,User Interface,122
3,Okay .,User Interface,122
3,And not too expensive .,Project Manager,123
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,124
3,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,125
3,Yeah .,User Interface,126
3,And uh simple .,User Interface,126
3,As we want to maximise the benefit .,Project Manager,127
3,And easy to use .,User Interface,128
3,"And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .",Marketing,129
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,130
3,"Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .",Project Manager,131
3,"Ah , yeah .",User Interface,132
3,It should be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,133
3,That's the problem .,Marketing,134
3,Okay .,User Interface,135
3,Okay .,User Interface,135
3,And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .,Project Manager,136
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,137
3,Okay .,User Interface,138
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,138
3,"So , is it okay ?",Project Manager,139
3,Yeah .,User Interface,140
3,Mm .,Marketing,141
3,It's clear .,Marketing,141
3,"{vocalsound} There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,142
3,"Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal .",Marketing,143
3,{vocalsound},Project Manager,144
3,Is it ?,Industrial Designer,145
3,{vocalsound} Are we supposed to do right now ?,Industrial Designer,145
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,145
3,"Yeah yeah , you try .",User Interface,146
3,Try first .,User Interface,146
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,146
3,Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,147
3,So,Project Manager,148
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,149
3,you think we have to do it now ?,Project Manager,150
3,I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now .,Industrial Designer,151
3,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,151
3,You can draw something which is very simple .,User Interface,152
3,{vocalsound},User Interface,152
3,You want me to draw something ?,Project Manager,153
3,Oh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,154
3,Product manager {disfmarker},Project Manager,155

4,"Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um {disfmarker} Should be a univ uh universal remote control {disfmarker} No , that's {disfmarker} I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only .",Project Manager,43
4,So have you changed that part ?,Project Manager,43
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,44
4,Okay .,User Interface,45
4,Okay .,Marketing,46
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,46
4,"Um so {disfmarker} yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly .",Project Manager,47
4,It's it's still the same .,Project Manager,47
4,Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at .,Project Manager,47
4,You all know them .,Project Manager,47
4,But uh there's another point .,Project Manager,47
4,The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people .,Project Manager,47
4,So they're old and not younger people .,Project Manager,47
4,So we have to look at that as well .,Project Manager,47
4,"'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .",Project Manager,47
4,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,48
4,"Uh so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,49
4,Which one first ?,User Interface,50
4,Okay .,Marketing,51
4,"Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,52
4,Okay .,User Interface,53
4,Mm .,Marketing,54
4,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,54
4,"Functional requirements , yeah",User Interface,55
4,Okay .,Marketing,56
4,"Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it .",Marketing,56
4,Wait .,Marketing,56
4,Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site .,Marketing,56
4,Uh I think you've uh read it too .,Marketing,56
4,Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .,Marketing,56
4,"I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me ,",Project Manager,57
4,You didn't read it ?,Marketing,58
4,I didn't get it uh anyway .,Project Manager,59
4,"No , I didn don't thing we got it .",User Interface,60
4,It's only for you .,Project Manager,61
4,"Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it .",Marketing,62
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,63
4,Yes .,User Interface,64
4,Okay it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users .,Marketing,65
4,And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .,Marketing,65
4,So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings .,Marketing,65
4,So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control .,Marketing,65
4,Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .,Marketing,65
4,"Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control .",Marketing,65
4,Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .,Marketing,65
4,I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people .,Marketing,65
4,Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good .,Marketing,65
4,Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .,Marketing,65
4,Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .,Marketing,65
4,"Well okay , that's uh normal .",Marketing,65
4,I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons .,Marketing,65
4,But that's one of our requirements .,Marketing,65
4,The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,66
4,"Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .",Marketing,67
4,So,Project Manager,68
4,Um Martijn alr already said it .,Marketing,69
4,if we {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,70
4,"And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but {disfmarker} I don't think it's uh",Marketing,71
4,"Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,",Project Manager,72
4,reachable .,Marketing,73
4,then you're you're {disfmarker},Project Manager,74
4,"Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .",Marketing,75
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,76
4,That that's a good one .,Marketing,77
4,Um uh page two .,Marketing,77
4,Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .,Marketing,77
4,That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something .,Marketing,77
4,"Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something .",Marketing,77
4,Uh you must find it uh quickly .,Marketing,77
4,Uh .,User Interface,78
4,Maybe just a button on the home station .,User Interface,78
4,So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .,User Interface,78
4,"Okay , yeah .",Marketing,79
4,"Yeah , we can uh combine that .",Marketing,79
4,Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control .,Marketing,79
4,Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this .,Marketing,79
4,It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent .,Marketing,79
4,But it's uh a tough one .,Marketing,79
4,"Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think .",Marketing,79
4,"Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .",Marketing,79
4,"Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something .",Marketing,79
4,I don't {disfmarker} We we haven't {disfmarker} Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point .,Marketing,79
4,"Okay , last page .",Marketing,79
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,80
4,"Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition .",Marketing,81
4,We didn't uh think about that already .,Marketing,81
4,And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control .,Marketing,81
4,We already thought about that .,Marketing,81
4,Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features .,Marketing,81
4,And but they're more critical .,Marketing,81
4,And older people uh want to spend uh more money .,Marketing,81
4,"{vocalsound} But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way .",Marketing,81
4,And they want to keep the old uh things the old things .,Marketing,81
4,{gap},Marketing,81
4,So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .,Project Manager,82
4,But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?,Marketing,83
4,People .,Project Manager,84
4,"So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,",Project Manager,84
4,"I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,",Marketing,85
4,Yeah .,User Interface,86
4,because {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,87
4,because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .,Marketing,88
4,It's too {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,89
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,90
4,Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference .,Marketing,91
4,"Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ .",Marketing,91
4,I had a question about .,Marketing,91
4,"But it's already out of the question , this .",Marketing,91
4,"Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros .",Marketing,91
4,But it's the exercise .,Marketing,91
4,Because it's too expensive .,Project Manager,92
4,"Yeah , probably .",Project Manager,92
4,"Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything .",Marketing,93
4,"And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .",Marketing,93
4,"Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .",User Interface,94
4,"Okay , I told about the home station .",Marketing,95
4,"Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it .",Marketing,95
4,And I I found a motto .,Marketing,95
4,And we put the fashion in electronics .,Marketing,95
4,And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style .,Marketing,95
4,We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product .,Marketing,95
4,We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,95
4,"One of a kind , I think .",Marketing,95
4,"So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,",Project Manager,96
4,Unique .,User Interface,97
4,"{vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .",Marketing,98
4,but {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,99
4,"Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker}",User Interface,100
4,But old people are not looking for that .,Project Manager,101
4,Uh I think mm {disfmarker},User Interface,102
4,Not really .,Project Manager,103
4,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,104
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,105
4,"I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .",Industrial Designer,105
4,Yeah .,User Interface,106
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing,107
4,Okay .,Project Manager,108
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,108
4,to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker},Marketing,109
4,"But uh we also have to stand out ,",User Interface,110
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,111
4,"Sorry I thought about it , yes .",Marketing,112
4,"'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff .",User Interface,113
4,"But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it .",User Interface,113
4,"So make it just a different colour or different shape ,",User Interface,113
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,114
4,Okay .,Project Manager,114
4,so {disfmarker},User Interface,115
4,"Okay , this was uh my presentation .",Marketing,116
4,Thanks .,Project Manager,117
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,118
4,I don't {disfmarker},Marketing,119
4,So,Project Manager,120
4,Yeah .,Marketing,121
4,"Paul , you can do the next one if you want .",Project Manager,122
4,You can ask some questions or something .,Marketing,123
4,Okay .,User Interface,124
4,Yeah well {disfmarker} Uh .,User Interface,124
4,"It's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,",Project Manager,125
4,There it is .,User Interface,126
4,isn't it ?,Project Manager,127
4,Okay .,User Interface,128
4,Technical functions design .,User Interface,128
4,"Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience .",User Interface,128
4,Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore .,User Interface,128
4,"But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple .",User Interface,128
4,Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard .,User Interface,128
4,So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls .,User Interface,128
4,"Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .",User Interface,128
4,So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker},Project Manager,129
4,"Yeah , I have it on the next page .",User Interface,130
4,Okay .,Project Manager,131
4,But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .,User Interface,132
4,"Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons .",User Interface,132
4,"Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does .",User Interface,132
4,So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it .,User Interface,132
4,"Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control",User Interface,132
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,133
4,to find out .,User Interface,134
4,But there is already in a one done .,User Interface,134
4,Of functions I could think of .,User Interface,134
4,"Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} .",User Interface,134
4,Just one two three etcetera .,User Interface,134
4,Uh text service options .,User Interface,134
4,Um basic on-off .,User Interface,134
4,And I found an uh {disfmarker} Could I think of favourites ?,User Interface,134
4,I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .,User Interface,134
4,Okay .,Project Manager,135
4,"But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker}",User Interface,136
4,"Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel .",Industrial Designer,137
4,So you might as well remember the number .,Industrial Designer,137
4,Or not ?,Industrial Designer,137
4,"Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,",Project Manager,138
4,No y,User Interface,139
4,but not sure {gap} .,Project Manager,140
4,Well,User Interface,141
4,"It's a good idea , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,142
4,it's {disfmarker} It was just a thought .,User Interface,143
4,"So I'm , I u {disfmarker} I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .",User Interface,143
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,144
4,But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?,Industrial Designer,144
4,Well uh,User Interface,145
4,Uh {gap} {disfmarker},Project Manager,146
4,what I was reading on the page .,User Interface,147
4,"Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television .",User Interface,147
4,So switch to channel six .,User Interface,147
4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,148
4,So uh button six says says six .,User Interface,149
4,"And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row .",User Interface,149
4,Just numbers .,User Interface,149
4,That can be in the in the {disfmarker},User Interface,149
4,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,150
4,"But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .",Industrial Designer,150
4,Well if you said a favourite {disfmarker},User Interface,151
4,"Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ?",Industrial Designer,152
4,Like favourite one and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,152
4,Uh mayb for me it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,153
4,Well i,User Interface,154
4,"If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never .",Project Manager,155
4,Never ?,User Interface,156
4,Oh .,User Interface,156
4,"No , neither do I .",Industrial Designer,157
4,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,158
4,Oh are you ?,User Interface,159
4,And {disfmarker},Project Manager,160
4,"Okay now , m maybe not .",User Interface,161
4,"If I don't do it , maybe old people {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager,162
4,"No , maybe elderly people uh .",User Interface,163
4,Right .,User Interface,163
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,164
4,They don't like new features .,User Interface,165
4,So maybe not .,User Interface,165
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,166
4,"Um well play , pause .",User Interface,167
4,I dunno if that's usable,User Interface,167
4,"It's not , it's still not {disfmarker} It's not anymore n uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,168
4,when {disfmarker} Not anymore for T_V_ .,User Interface,169
4,{gap},Project Manager,170
4,"Right , on off .",User Interface,171
4,"{vocalsound} I dunno , miss {disfmarker} Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ?",User Interface,171
4,"I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ .",User Interface,171
4,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,172
4,Just on the front as well .,Project Manager,173
4,"No , that's the only th the only thing you need .",Project Manager,173
4,Is {disfmarker},User Interface,174
4,Uh uh the p uh next and previous .,Industrial Designer,175
4,"Previous I know , but next channel ?",Industrial Designer,175
4,Just the channel um uh {disfmarker} What I mean is uh {disfmarker},User Interface,176
4,I don't thi,Industrial Designer,177
4,Forward .,Marketing,178
4,"Li like a web browser ,",Industrial Designer,179
4,Six seven eight or five .,User Interface,180
4,"so {disfmarker} Oh , okay .",Industrial Designer,181
4,Just very simple .,Project Manager,182
4,But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before .,Industrial Designer,183
4,Like a web browser back button .,Industrial Designer,183
4,Um I dunno .,User Interface,184
4,"Uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,",Project Manager,185
4,I don't have {disfmarker} Uh I did {disfmarker},User Interface,186
4,"I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people .",Project Manager,187
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,187
4,"Yeah ,",User Interface,188
4,No .,Marketing,189
4,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,189
4,I don't think you use that .,User Interface,190
4,Y only when you want to go to {disfmarker},User Interface,190
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,191
4,"Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .",User Interface,192
4,"And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ?",Project Manager,193
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,194
4,"Normally you can press one , zero or {disfmarker}",Project Manager,195
4,"Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons .",User Interface,196
4,So you have that uh {disfmarker},User Interface,196
4,A ten plus or {disfmarker},Project Manager,197
4,"Yeah , the ten plus button .",User Interface,198
4,"Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .",User Interface,198
4,Okay .,Project Manager,199
4,To just keep it simple and standard uh features .,User Interface,200
4,"Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough .",Industrial Designer,201
4,Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,201
4,Uh yeah mayb,User Interface,202
4,It gets some seconds .,Marketing,203
4,But I think that's in the T_V_ as well .,User Interface,204
4,That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it .,User Interface,204
4,But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .,User Interface,204
4,Oh okay .,Industrial Designer,205
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,205
4,"Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}",Marketing,206
4,So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .,User Interface,207
4,"Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,208
4,It's what Paul says .,Marketing,209
4,It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two .,Marketing,209
4,It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .,Marketing,209
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,210
4,"So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .",User Interface,211
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,212
4,"So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that {disfmarker} And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and {disfmarker}",User Interface,213
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,214
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,214
4,But do we still need a two level remote control ?,Project Manager,215
4,Because if we only have that l only f,Project Manager,215
4,It's only for television now .,Marketing,216
4,So I I don't think so .,User Interface,217
4,No .,Project Manager,218
4,Uh I just thought of another one .,User Interface,219
4,No .,Marketing,220
4,Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .,User Interface,221
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,222
4,So you also need a menu button .,User Interface,223
4,"And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker} But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,",User Interface,223
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,224
4,so you have,User Interface,225
4,"I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .",Industrial Designer,226
4,four arrows .,User Interface,227
4,Because you n almost never use menu button .,Industrial Designer,228
4,"Yeah , okay ,",User Interface,229
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,230
4,but um {disfmarker},User Interface,231
4,"Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure .",Project Manager,232
4,You'll also have to use a mute button to to {disfmarker},Project Manager,232
4,"Yeah , a mute button .",User Interface,233
4,Yes .,User Interface,233
4,"Maybe , not {disfmarker}",Project Manager,234
4,Don't think so .,User Interface,235
4,I don't know where where you have to put it .,Project Manager,236
4,"Yeah well ,",User Interface,237
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,238
4,that's that's {disfmarker} I think that's the layers that produce .,User Interface,239
4,Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on .,User Interface,239
4,What we're gonna use .,User Interface,239
4,Okay .,Project Manager,240
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,240
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,240
4,That's right .,Project Manager,240
4,And later we can d uh do the design .,User Interface,241
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,242
4,"Okay , uh now my personal preferences .",User Interface,243
4,"Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design .",User Interface,243
4,"So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual .",User Interface,243
4,"So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out .",User Interface,243
4,Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .,User Interface,243
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,244
4,Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours,Project Manager,244
4,Um {disfmarker} I dunno .,User Interface,245
4,Different colours um {disfmarker},User Interface,245
4,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,246
4,Maybe we can give it out in different colours .,Marketing,247
4,You can choose blue or yellow,Marketing,247
4,It's like a iMac or something .,Project Manager,248
4,or {disfmarker},Marketing,249
4,{vocalsound} Just to make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,250
4,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,251
4,Yeah .,User Interface,252
4,Well why not ?,User Interface,252
4,Or {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface,252
4,That's fa That's fancy .,Marketing,253
4,That's uh fashion .,Marketing,253
4,"But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing .",Project Manager,254
4,It's only twenty five Euros .,Project Manager,254
4,It looks very cheap if you make it {disfmarker},Project Manager,254
4,"Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .",User Interface,255
4,"Oh , you just {disfmarker} I dunno what happened .",Project Manager,256
4,Oh .,User Interface,257
4,{gap},Marketing,258
4,Who ?,User Interface,259
4,"Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right .",Project Manager,260
4,Just {disfmarker},Project Manager,260
4,They they're uh designed very well .,User Interface,261
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,262
4,"And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller .",User Interface,263
4,"You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .",User Interface,263
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,264
4,"But uh well , I think that's a good example .",User Interface,265
4,"Okay , {gap}",Project Manager,266
4,Okay .,Marketing,267
4,"we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it .",Project Manager,268
4,"Okay , sorry .",User Interface,269
4,Is it fin Are you finished ?,Project Manager,270
4,Well uh {disfmarker},User Interface,271
4,Okay .,Project Manager,272
4,"Yeah , I I'm finished .",User Interface,273
4,I think we discussed everything .,User Interface,273
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,274
4,"Well , the working design .",Industrial Designer,274
4,The method I used is uh search the web .,Industrial Designer,274
4,Just the web page provided .,Industrial Designer,274
4,"Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out .",Industrial Designer,274
4,"Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch .",Industrial Designer,274
4,"And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed .",Industrial Designer,274
4,"So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern .",Industrial Designer,274
4,Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ .,Industrial Designer,274
4,"That's the uh light emitting diode , I think .",Industrial Designer,274
4,Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light .,Industrial Designer,274
4,That's un uh invisible to the human eye .,Industrial Designer,274
4,And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ .,Industrial Designer,274
4,However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it .,Industrial Designer,274
4,"And that's uh another diode , I believe .",Industrial Designer,274
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,275
4,Because infrared is not visible .,Industrial Designer,276
4,So that's er uh do two different things,Industrial Designer,276
4,So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?,Project Manager,277
4,but {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,278
4,I I think so .,Industrial Designer,278
4,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,278
4,Uh j Is {disfmarker},User Interface,279
4,I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .,Industrial Designer,280
4,"Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable .",Project Manager,281
4,Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?,User Interface,282
4,"Yeah , that's active .",Marketing,283
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,284
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,285
4,"Or just a green one ,",Project Manager,286
4,So {disfmarker},User Interface,287
4,"because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .",Project Manager,288
4,Yeah .,User Interface,289
4,Maybe uh {disfmarker},User Interface,289
4,I I think it's in the case that it's active .,Marketing,290
4,It's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing,290
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,291
4,"Yeah , when you press it .",Industrial Designer,292
4,But if you {disfmarker},Project Manager,293
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,294
4,I it's it's just uh the the {disfmarker},Marketing,295
4,"Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,",Project Manager,296
4,Two ?,Industrial Designer,297
4,"and green is like it's okay , you press the button .",Project Manager,298
4,Mm .,Marketing,299
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,300
4,Maybe depends on uh {disfmarker},User Interface,301
4,Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .,Industrial Designer,302
4,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,303
4,Yes .,User Interface,304
4,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,305
4,Yeah .,Marketing,306
4,"Okay , we make it red .",Project Manager,307
4,But maybe {disfmarker},User Interface,308
4,So,Industrial Designer,309
4,Well,User Interface,310
4,I know .,Industrial Designer,311
4,we don't have to make it red .,User Interface,312
4,Maybe integrate it in the design as well .,User Interface,312
4,You have to {disfmarker} The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons .,Project Manager,313
4,Uh that's cool .,Project Manager,313
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,313
4,{vocalsound} I I think uh the batteries will be uh {vocalsound} a little {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,314
4,"Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Oh ,",User Interface,315
4,{vocalsound} Empty .,Marketing,316
4,maybe it's it is would an e No .,User Interface,317
4,Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,317
4,"No , we have a recharger in it , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,318
4,Oh .,User Interface,319
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,320
4,If we can still make that then {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,321
4,Uh maybe .,Industrial Designer,322
4,"Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red .",User Interface,323
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,324
4,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,325
4,It's just to indicate something's on .,User Interface,326
4,Yeah .,Marketing,327
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,328
4,That it's working .,Industrial Designer,328
4,That it's not not the batteries are low .,Industrial Designer,328
4,But it's cool if it was green .,Project Manager,329
4,Yeah .,User Interface,330
4,"It's it's not very important ,",User Interface,330
4,"Green or red or whatever , it is cool .",Project Manager,331
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,331
4,so yeah .,User Interface,332
4,"Yeah , I know .",Industrial Designer,333
4,Just to indicate it's working .,Industrial Designer,333
4,So mm {disfmarker},User Interface,334
4,And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern .,Industrial Designer,335
4,"So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal .",Industrial Designer,335
4,So that it can be used with all the T_V_s .,Industrial Designer,335
4,"We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work .",Industrial Designer,335
4,"So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,336
4,No .,Industrial Designer,337
4,I I uh {disfmarker} The chip um uh is producing the pattern .,Industrial Designer,337
4,"So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,337
4,Okay .,User Interface,338
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,339
4,"An automatically search function for each television , or something .",Marketing,340
4,That are working .,Industrial Designer,341
4,"Yeah , or {disfmarker} I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works .",Industrial Designer,341
4,It wasn't explained there .,Industrial Designer,341
4,"Well , I I use a universal uh remote control ,",User Interface,342
4,Uh I kno,Marketing,343
4,"and {gap} list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera .",User Interface,344
4,"And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ .",User Interface,344
4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,345
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,345
4,"Oh , I have a modern one .",Marketing,346
4,{vocalsound},User Interface,347
4,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,348
4,"And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink .",Marketing,349
4,And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off .,Marketing,349
4,"And then you know , oh it it's the right one .",Marketing,349
4,"And you can stop it ,",Marketing,349
4,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer,350
4,and then it's okay .,Marketing,351
4,So you don't have to search for your television or your code .,Marketing,351
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,352
4,It uh search uh the pattern for itself .,Marketing,353
4,"Okay ,",User Interface,354
4,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,355
4,so we use that .,User Interface,356
4,So it uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one .,Industrial Designer,357
4,Because you have to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,357
4,Yes .,Marketing,358
4,Yep .,User Interface,359
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,360
4,"I just say {disfmarker} Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking {disfmarker} There's just a short {disfmarker}",Project Manager,361
4,Uh okay .,Industrial Designer,362
4,Well uh y you have this chip .,Industrial Designer,362
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,363
4,"That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .",Industrial Designer,364
4,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,365
4,But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different .,Industrial Designer,366
4,So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one .,Industrial Designer,366
4,"And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically .",Industrial Designer,366
4,So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .,Industrial Designer,366
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,367
4,"And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .",Industrial Designer,368
4,Changing the signal .,Marketing,369
4,"And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television .",Industrial Designer,370
4,"And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting",Industrial Designer,370
4,Okay .,Project Manager,371
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,371
4,and then um it's working .,Industrial Designer,372
4,"Yeah , that's the right uh option .",Marketing,373
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,374
4,Well uh the components .,Industrial Designer,374
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,375
4,"Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time .",Industrial Designer,376
4,Um but I think I understand it .,Industrial Designer,376
4,"Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .",Industrial Designer,376
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,377
4,Um that's connecting to all the components .,Industrial Designer,378
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,379
4,Because it has to be fed with energy .,Industrial Designer,380
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,380
4,Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed .,Industrial Designer,380
4,"So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed .",Industrial Designer,380
4,Um that's connecting to a chip .,Industrial Designer,380
4,So the chip knows what button you pressed .,Industrial Designer,380
4,And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb .,Industrial Designer,380
4,I didn didn't put the description by this one .,Industrial Designer,380
4,Th this is a normal bulb .,Industrial Designer,380
4,So the normal flashing light .,Industrial Designer,380
4,Okay .,Project Manager,381
4,"So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .",Project Manager,381
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,382
4,"Yeah , and this is a LED too .",Industrial Designer,382
4,{gap},Marketing,383
4,But this one is producing infrared light,Industrial Designer,384
4,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,385
4,that's invisible .,Industrial Designer,386
4,And this one is producing normal light .,Industrial Designer,386
4,So we can make the normal one also a normal light .,Project Manager,387
4,"Not a LED light , but as a normal one .",Project Manager,387
4,To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,387
4,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,388
4,"Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works .",Marketing,389
4,But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .,Marketing,389
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,390
4,"Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah .",Industrial Designer,391
4,"Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .",Industrial Designer,391
4,Yeah .,Marketing,392
4,"Yeah , and {disfmarker}",Marketing,392
4,Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push .,Project Manager,393
4,So you see green if you push that button .,Project Manager,393
4,"Huh , that's a good idea .",Industrial Designer,394
4,Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .,Marketing,395
4,"Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .",Project Manager,396
4,"No , y Yeah .",User Interface,397
4,Okay .,Marketing,398
4,And it's {disfmarker} you also know which button you p,Project Manager,399
4,But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .,Marketing,400
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,401
4,But it {disfmarker},Project Manager,401
4,Everywhere in the r,Marketing,402
4,But does it make any difference for the energy you use ?,Project Manager,403
4,You got still one LED .,Project Manager,403
4,"No I don't think so , but {disfmarker} Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else .",User Interface,404
4,"That looks different , yeah .",Project Manager,405
4,Yeah .,User Interface,406
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,407
4,"'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is {disfmarker}",User Interface,408
4,Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?,Marketing,409
4,"Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .",User Interface,410
4,"Yeah , okay .",Marketing,411
4,"Yeah , but mm like when you push it",Industrial Designer,412
4,"{gap} Yeah , then then won't {disfmarker} Then you won't see it .",User Interface,413
4,n n Yeah .,Industrial Designer,414
4,You have your finger over the button .,Industrial Designer,414
4,So you can see {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,414
4,It must be around it then .,Marketing,415
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,416
4,Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing,Industrial Designer,416
4,"Yeah , then {disfmarker}",Marketing,417
4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,418
4,Yeah .,Marketing,419
4,"Not not not not here , but here .",Marketing,419
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,420
4,There .,Industrial Designer,420
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,420
4,Maybe uh {disfmarker},Marketing,421
4,"The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?",Project Manager,422
4,"{gap} Yeah , we're thinking about it .",User Interface,423
4,If you push {disfmarker},Project Manager,424
4,"Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh",User Interface,425
4,It lights up .,Project Manager,426
4,Everything lights up .,Project Manager,426
4,That's a good idea .,Project Manager,426
4,everything lights up .,User Interface,427
4,Why ain't that on a remote control ?,User Interface,427
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,428
4,It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .,Project Manager,429
4,"Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's {disfmarker}",User Interface,430
4,Okay .,Marketing,431
4,It's f Yeah .,Project Manager,432
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,433
4,Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .,Project Manager,434
4,"Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote .",User Interface,435
4,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,436
4,It's only few LEDs .,Project Manager,437
4,Only four or something .,Project Manager,437
4,Four LED .,Project Manager,437
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,438
4,"No , I dunno .",User Interface,439
4,"But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use {disfmarker}",User Interface,439
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing,440
4,"Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .",Project Manager,441
4,I uh {disfmarker},Marketing,442
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,443
4,We'll have enough power,Industrial Designer,443
4,Everything agre,Project Manager,444
4,to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,445
4,"Everyone agrees with that , or {disfmarker} Okay .",Project Manager,446
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,447
4,Yeah .,Marketing,448
4,Yep .,User Interface,449
4,"Maybe what Paul said , uh under the {disfmarker} on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .",Marketing,450
4,"Yeah , and then you {disfmarker} Okay , yeah .",Project Manager,451
4,But you have to make a sound device in it then .,Project Manager,451
4,And also it's {disfmarker},User Interface,452
4,"Yeah , there must be sound in it .",Marketing,453
4,But {disfmarker},Project Manager,454
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,455
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,456
4,"Okay , it shouldn't take much {disfmarker}",User Interface,457
4,I dunno .,Marketing,458
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,459
4,B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make .,Industrial Designer,459
4,Especially for that kind of money .,Industrial Designer,459
4,Because it's i it has to be {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,459
4,"Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .",Marketing,460
4,Uh I th,User Interface,461
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,462
4,Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .,Industrial Designer,462
4,"Bec Twelve and a half , okay .",Marketing,463
4,"But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .",Marketing,463
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,464
4,I think uh you also have uh {vocalsound} remote controls with a lot of options .,User Interface,465
4,So {disfmarker},Marketing,466
4,But we lose about ninety percent of those options .,User Interface,467
4,So I think you can uh {disfmarker},User Interface,467
4,Uh .,Marketing,468
4,We have to give our customers some extras .,Marketing,468
4,Yeah .,User Interface,469
4,I think we will save money with that .,User Interface,469
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,470
4,Okay .,Project Manager,471
4,Are you almost finished or just {disfmarker},Project Manager,471
4,"Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .",Industrial Designer,472
4,Okay .,Project Manager,473
4,Okay .,Project Manager,473
4,Because I was short on time .,Industrial Designer,474
4,No worry .,Project Manager,475
4,But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .,Industrial Designer,476
4,"Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more .",Project Manager,477
4,So maybe you have to {disfmarker} Yeah ?,Project Manager,477
4,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,478
4,Okay .,Project Manager,479
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,480
4,"So this {disfmarker} Oh , sorry .",Project Manager,481
4,Wh what's that ?,Project Manager,481
4,"So uh {disfmarker} Oh , sorry .",Project Manager,481
4,We have some new uh project requirements .,Project Manager,481
4,We have to have a look what they are .,Project Manager,481
4,They're still in um {disfmarker} Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet .,Project Manager,481
4,"So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one .",Project Manager,481
4,I'm not sure .,Project Manager,481
4,"I don't think so ,",Project Manager,481
4,"No ,",Industrial Designer,482
4,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,483
4,"and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .",Industrial Designer,484
4,No .,Marketing,485
4,"Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television .",Project Manager,486
4,It's only one button .,Project Manager,486
4,So I don't think it is {disfmarker},Project Manager,486
4,Yeah .,User Interface,487
4,Uh .,Marketing,488
4,We definitely should use it .,Project Manager,489
4,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,489
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,490
4,"Yeah , that's uh what I told you .",Project Manager,491
4,The remote control should only be used for a television .,Project Manager,491
4,So that's maybe easier .,Project Manager,491
4,"And um the the forty plus people , I already told you .",Project Manager,491
4,"Oh no , sorry .",Project Manager,491
4,"Oh , this is a problem .",Project Manager,491
4,Oh sorry about that .,Project Manager,491
4,The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .,Project Manager,491
4,So it should be flashy or just more interesting .,Project Manager,491
4,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing,492
4,Oh .,Industrial Designer,493
4,Mm .,Industrial Designer,493
4,"Okay , that's {disfmarker} It changes things .",User Interface,494
4,I'm sorry about that .,Project Manager,495
4,I just I just didn't read it well .,Project Manager,495
4,{vocalsound},Marketing,496
4,So does it make some decision about that ?,Project Manager,497
4,{vocalsound},Project Manager,497
4,Changes .,Marketing,498
4,{vocalsound},User Interface,499
4,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,500
4,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,501
4,That kinda changes the whole situation .,Industrial Designer,502
4,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,503
4,"Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features .",User Interface,504
4,"I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,",User Interface,504
4,That still stays .,Project Manager,505
4,to make it more like a mobile phone .,User Interface,506
4,More modern .,User Interface,506
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,507
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,508
4,That's important I think and {disfmarker},User Interface,509
4,L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .,Marketing,510
4,"And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it .",User Interface,511
4,Oh .,Marketing,512
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,513
4,So {disfmarker},User Interface,514
4,"Mm ah {disfmarker} I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,515
4,"Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one .",Marketing,516
4,Okay .,Marketing,516
4,"{vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker}",Marketing,516
4,"{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .",User Interface,517
4,{vocalsound} No .,Industrial Designer,518
4,"So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface,519
4,What other features can we put in ?,User Interface,519
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,520
4,I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular .,Industrial Designer,520
4,"And uh then the usability is not that required , because the {disfmarker} Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .",Industrial Designer,520
4,But uh some of you had uh something to read about um {vocalsound} uh speech uh recognition .,Marketing,521
4,About you said one and the television turns on one .,Marketing,521
4,Is that reachable maybe ?,Marketing,521
4,I didn't read {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,522
4,That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy .,Marketing,523
4,That's cool .,Marketing,523
4,It's very fashion .,User Interface,524
4,I didn't read any,Industrial Designer,525
4,Twelve and you've got twelve .,Marketing,526
4,b Yeah .,Industrial Designer,527
4,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,527
4,Mm .,User Interface,528
4,I I know .,Industrial Designer,529
4,"Only the numbers , only numbers .",Marketing,530
4,Uh furthermore nothing .,Marketing,530
4,"But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .",Marketing,530
4,Mm .,Industrial Designer,531
4,That should be cool .,Marketing,532
4,"Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well .",Project Manager,533
4,If it's possible .,Project Manager,533
4,But {disfmarker},Project Manager,533
4,"If it's possible ,",Marketing,534
4,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,535
4,I don't think it's very expensive actually .,Project Manager,536
4,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,537
4,I dunno .,Marketing,538
4,I didn't read it .,Marketing,538
4,Mm .,User Interface,539
4,Why should it ?,Project Manager,540
4,"Yeah , I think it's {disfmarker}",User Interface,541
4,Uh if i if i,Marketing,542
4,You only have a microphone in it .,Project Manager,543
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,544
4,I didn't have information about that .,Marketing,545
4,But it has to work .,Industrial Designer,546
4,"And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,546
4,"Nah , maybe {disfmarker}",Project Manager,547
4,"Ah that's a problem , but {disfmarker}",Marketing,548
4,And and uh w Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,549
4,Uh only in English .,Marketing,550
4,Only in English I think .,Marketing,550
4,What {disfmarker} But uh I dunno how that works then .,User Interface,551
4,Uh does your uh {disfmarker} Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever,User Interface,551
4,"Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,552
4,uh one to have in channel one ?,User Interface,553
4,"No , that {disfmarker} Yeah , then th we have to think about that .",Marketing,554
4,But do {vocalsound} do we do it ?,Marketing,554
4,"Yeah ,",User Interface,555
4,It's more if we if we do it .,Marketing,556
4,I dunno .,User Interface,557
4,"So , is it very usable ?",User Interface,557
4,That's what I'm looking at .,User Interface,557
4,And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing,Industrial Designer,558
4,Yeah .,Marketing,559
4,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,560
4,Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .,Project Manager,561
4,Is {disfmarker},User Interface,562
4,"It {disfmarker} We have short time to to put it on the market ,",Project Manager,563
4,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,564
4,so that {disfmarker} We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .,Project Manager,565
4,Mm {disfmarker} Yeah well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,566
4,Okay .,Marketing,567
4,"Yeah , I think so .",Industrial Designer,568
4,{gap},Industrial Designer,568
4,"We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .",Project Manager,569
4,{gap},Project Manager,569
4,"Yeah , and uh and uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,570
4,It's {disfmarker},User Interface,571
4,In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing .,Marketing,572
4,Uh because we we have a lot of languages .,Marketing,572
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,573
4,I d Yeah .,User Interface,574
4,I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .,User Interface,574
4,And and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,575
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,576
4,I think so .,Project Manager,576
4,"Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,577
4,Yeah .,Marketing,578
4,"A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .",Marketing,578
4,the remote away .,Industrial Designer,579
4,Mm .,Industrial Designer,579
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,579
4,Mm .,Industrial Designer,579
4,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,579
4,"Yeah ,",Marketing,580
4,Yeah .,User Interface,581
4,"Well yeah ,",User Interface,581
4,it's not uh {disfmarker},Marketing,582
4,that's the right command .,User Interface,583
4,"And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something .",User Interface,583
4,"Not just one ,",User Interface,583
4,"But {disfmarker} Hmm yeah , T_V_ one .",Industrial Designer,584
4,but {disfmarker},User Interface,585
4,"Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .",Marketing,586
4,Well I dunno .,User Interface,587
4,"But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .",User Interface,587
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,588
4,So,Project Manager,589
4,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,590
4,we have to make some decisions .,Project Manager,591
4,So,Project Manager,591
4,"Okay , no speech recognition .",Marketing,592
4,you can see on the uh {disfmarker} So we have to know what we're going to put on .,Project Manager,593
4,"Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ?",Project Manager,593
4,Do {disfmarker},Project Manager,593
4,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,594
4,"If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?",Project Manager,595
4,"Yeah , that's good .",Industrial Designer,596
4,"Okay , we just take that one .",Project Manager,597
4,Yep .,User Interface,598
4,"And what else , we have {disfmarker}",Project Manager,599
4,Also the one in the dark .,User Interface,600
4,So uh {disfmarker} It lights up when it's dark ?,User Interface,600
4,"Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .",Project Manager,601
4,I didn't {disfmarker},User Interface,602
4,"If you push something , it it all lights up .",Project Manager,603
4,Okay .,User Interface,604
4,Yeah .,Marketing,605
4,"Yeah yeah ,",Marketing,605
4,"Yeah , but um {disfmarker}",User Interface,606
4,it it mustn't work all the time .,Marketing,607
4,"Yes , that's what I mean .",User Interface,608
4,It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .,Marketing,609
4,Or you can switch it on or something .,Project Manager,610
4,So if you {disfmarker},Marketing,611
4,Or maybe when you {disfmarker},User Interface,612
4,"No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .",Marketing,613
4,yeah .,User Interface,614
4,It lights up all .,User Interface,614
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,615
4,"You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,615
4,That's what I said .,Project Manager,615
4,It's the same as the telephone .,Project Manager,615
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,615
4,Okay yeah .,User Interface,616
4,"D Yeah , alright .",User Interface,616
4,Yeah .,User Interface,616
4,And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ?,Project Manager,617
4,"Like a iMac , {gap} if you can look through it .",Project Manager,617
4,Or just a normal remote control .,Project Manager,617
4,"Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .",User Interface,618
4,"Mm , maybe it's a good idea .",Industrial Designer,619
4,"Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .",User Interface,620
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,621
4,Like uh phones .,User Interface,622
4,Oh yeah .,Marketing,623
4,Different colours .,Project Manager,624
4,"Okay ,",Project Manager,624
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,625
4,so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ?,Project Manager,626
4,A see-through .,Marketing,627
4,"Mm , that's cool .",Marketing,627
4,Yeah .,User Interface,628
4,Uh as an option maybe .,User Interface,628
4,Okay .,Project Manager,629
4,"And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal .",Project Manager,629
4,"We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,",Project Manager,629
4,It's the standard {disfmarker},User Interface,630
4,and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .,Project Manager,631
4,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,",User Interface,632
4,But you have {disfmarker} You had a lot of different buttons .,Marketing,633
4,we but we don't {disfmarker} We don't really have any complicated buttons .,User Interface,634
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,635
4,"Yeah , maybe you have you have to {disfmarker} Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .",Project Manager,636
4,"Yeah okay , but {disfmarker} Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy .",User Interface,637
4,With just uh standard buttons we just have so little {disfmarker},User Interface,637
4,O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control .,Project Manager,638
4,Because you ne almost never use it .,Project Manager,638
4,"No , I don't need don't need {disfmarker} Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .",User Interface,639
4,"Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .",Industrial Designer,640
4,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,641
4,I use teletext as well .,User Interface,642
4,So uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,643
4,"No , I use te teletext every day , I think .",Marketing,644
4,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,645
4,Okay .,Industrial Designer,645
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,646
4,"For me too , it is .",Project Manager,646
4,So we just keep it one level then ?,Project Manager,646
4,Okay .,Project Manager,646
4,"Yeah yeah , one level .",User Interface,647
4,"And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,",User Interface,647
4,Mm .,Marketing,648
4,I think the design is most important .,User Interface,649
4,You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .,User Interface,649
4,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,650
4,Yeah .,Project Manager,651
4,'Cause {gap} simple buttons .,User Interface,652
4,Okay .,Project Manager,653
4,"If you put one above it , it's clear .",User Interface,654
4,Okay .,Project Manager,655
4,So that's it for toda for {disfmarker} We're going to have a lunch lunch break .,Project Manager,655

5,{vocalsound},Marketing,21
5,I see some interesting {disfmarker},Project Manager,22
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,23
5,okay .,Project Manager,24
5,You wish .,User Interface,25
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,25
5,"Possibilities , yeah ?",Industrial Designer,26
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,26
5,"{vocalsound} People , welcome back .",Project Manager,27
5,Welcome .,User Interface,28
5,Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,28
5,The third meeting .,Project Manager,29
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,29
5,Oop .,Marketing,30
5,Um I have some points I would like to {disfmarker} uh some some issues I would like to point out .,Project Manager,31
5,"Um {vocalsound} first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?",Project Manager,31
5,"If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,",Project Manager,31
5,Yeah .,User Interface,32
5,so I could {disfmarker} uh can uh um use that in the in the report .,Project Manager,33
5,"{vocalsound} Um the second thing , um {vocalsound} I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared .",Project Manager,33
5,That's quite strange .,Project Manager,33
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,34
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,35
5,Okay .,Project Manager,36
5,"We'll come to that later , I g I think .",Project Manager,36
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,37
5,Um {vocalsound} the agenda for now {disfmarker} uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?,Project Manager,38
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,39
5,No .,User Interface,40
5,Not at all .,Industrial Designer,41
5,Okay .,Project Manager,42
5,Um,Project Manager,42
5,No .,Marketing,43
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,44
5,"we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing .",Project Manager,45
5,Forty minutes in total for this .,Project Manager,45
5,"So um {vocalsound} I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .",Project Manager,45
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,46
5,"Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .",Project Manager,47
5,'Kay .,Marketing,48
5,Hmm ?,Marketing,48
5,Alright .,User Interface,49
5,Oh .,Marketing,50
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,51
5,{gap} .,Marketing,52
5,"Just press the okay button , it works .",Industrial Designer,53
5,"Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} Okay .",Marketing,54
5,Um yeah .,Project Manager,55
5,Yeah .,Marketing,56
5,Yeah .,Marketing,56
5,My method ?,Marketing,56
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,56
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,57
5,{vocalsound} How surprising .,Industrial Designer,58
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,58
5,"Well , findings .",Marketing,59
5,"Uh {disfmarker} Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important .",Marketing,59
5,"And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,",Marketing,59
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,60
5,and that they want spongy material .,Marketing,61
5,Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .,Marketing,61
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,62
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,63
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,64
5,Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours .,Marketing,65
5,Simple shapes {gap} uh m material .,Marketing,65
5,But we {disfmarker} since we are concentrating on uh the younger group {disfmarker},Marketing,65
5,Uh w wait a sec wait a se,Project Manager,66
5,Oh wait uh wait up .,Industrial Designer,67
5,uh could you go to the previous slide ?,Project Manager,68
5,Um because I'm taking minutes,Project Manager,68
5,'Kay .,Marketing,69
5,Um were the important themes enclose .,Project Manager,70
5,Yeah {gap} okay .,Project Manager,70
5,The feel of {gap} to be spongy {disfmarker},Project Manager,70
5,Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?,Industrial Designer,71
5,"Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful .",Marketing,72
5,Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .,Marketing,72
5,Not something dull .,Industrial Designer,73
5,"But they like dark colours ,",User Interface,74
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,75
5,you said in the p,User Interface,76
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,77
5,"No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .",Marketing,78
5,Okay .,User Interface,79
5,Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .,User Interface,79
5,But {disfmarker},Marketing,80
5,I had {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface,81
5,But can you can you go back to that slide ?,Industrial Designer,82
5,The {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer,82
5,Which one ?,Marketing,83
5,"just one slide back ,",Industrial Designer,84
5,This ?,Marketing,85
5,no no no .,Industrial Designer,86
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,86
5,"Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .",Industrial Designer,86
5,Yes .,Marketing,87
5,"Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?",Industrial Designer,88
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,88
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,89
5,"{vocalsound} Uh well , it might .",Marketing,90
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,91
5,But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control .,Marketing,92
5,But {disfmarker} Maybe soft material or something .,Marketing,92
5,But not a real sponge .,Marketing,92
5,"Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard .",Project Manager,93
5,It it {disfmarker} maybe it rubber or or {disfmarker},Project Manager,93
5,"Yeah , exactly .",Marketing,94
5,yeah .,Project Manager,95
5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,95
5,"Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,",Marketing,96
5,Or we could make {disfmarker} oh .,User Interface,97
5,"but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So {disfmarker}",Marketing,98
5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,99
5,"Well , this this is an example of what they would like .",Marketing,100
5,"But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .",Marketing,100
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,101
5,So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .,Marketing,102
5,"Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager,103
5,It's quite interesting .,Industrial Designer,104
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,104
5,"You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .",Project Manager,105
5,"Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh {vocalsound} telephone from uh Siemens .",User Interface,106
5,The yellow uh rubber telephone .,User Interface,106
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,107
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,107
5,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,108
5,It's the it's the rubber uh cover .,User Interface,109
5,"Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .",Project Manager,110
5,And it's uh colourful .,User Interface,111
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,112
5,It looks likes a banana .,User Interface,113
5,"{vocalsound} We have the fruit , we have the colours .",User Interface,113
5,{vocalsound} We have the simple design .,User Interface,113
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,114
5,Do you know the phone ?,Project Manager,115
5,"I don't know the phone ,",Industrial Designer,116
5,"It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,",Project Manager,117
5,but I can imagine it .,Industrial Designer,118
5,"I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,",Project Manager,119
5,Um thirty five .,User Interface,120
5,"Oh , that one , yes .",Industrial Designer,121
5,the very {disfmarker},Project Manager,122
5,And the b the light blue and {vocalsound} it's also in yellow .,User Interface,123
5,"Now I kn uh {disfmarker} oh , I know , I know .",Industrial Designer,124
5,"Yes , I I've seen it .",Industrial Designer,124
5,I've seen it .,Industrial Designer,124
5,"You kn you know , Ruud , as well ?",Project Manager,125
5,About th,Project Manager,125
5,"I've seen it ,",Marketing,126
5,Okay .,Project Manager,127
5,Okay .,Project Manager,127
5,Um uh,Project Manager,127
5,but {disfmarker},Marketing,128
5,okay .,Project Manager,129
5,Do you have {gap} {disfmarker} uh thit {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker},Project Manager,129
5,'Kay .,Marketing,130
5,Uh that's about it .,Marketing,130
5,Okay .,Project Manager,131
5,"{vocalsound} Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the {disfmarker} our target group .",Project Manager,131
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,132
5,Yes .,Marketing,133
5,And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .,Project Manager,134
5,Uh soft material .,Marketing,135
5,Okay .,Project Manager,136
5,"So {disfmarker} So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important .",Industrial Designer,137
5,And what was even more important ?,Industrial Designer,137
5,Uh the fancy look and feel .,Marketing,138
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,139
5,So that's the most important thing for our customers .,Industrial Designer,139
5,Yes .,Marketing,140
5,Apparently .,Marketing,140
5,"Okay , Roo ,",Project Manager,141
5,Yeah .,User Interface,142
5,could you do your presentation ?,Project Manager,143
5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,144
5,"Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion .",User Interface,144
5,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,144
5,"Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .",Project Manager,145
5,{vocalsound} Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume .,User Interface,146
5,"Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these .",User Interface,146
5,"These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .",User Interface,146
5,Shape .,Project Manager,147
5,So I suggest {disfmarker} I couldn't uh {disfmarker} I had a small uh mock-up uh {vocalsound} sign on the {vocalsound} on {gap} paper .,User Interface,148
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,149
5,{vocalsound} But it didn't work .,User Interface,150
5,My pen didn't load um the information .,User Interface,150
5,So I made a really simple {vocalsound} f uh a shape on uh {disfmarker} in um PowerPoint .,User Interface,150
5,But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control .,User Interface,150
5,Uh yellow .,User Interface,150
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,151
5,"But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .",Industrial Designer,151
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,152
5,Yeah .,Marketing,153
5,"And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .",Project Manager,154
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,155
5,"Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,",Project Manager,156
5,Slippery .,Industrial Designer,157
5,s because um {disfmarker},Project Manager,158
5,"But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .",User Interface,159
5,You have to grab it .,Industrial Designer,160
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,161
5,"Yeah , exactly .",Project Manager,161
5,So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .,User Interface,162
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,163
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,164
5,"There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,",Industrial Designer,164
5,"Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .",Project Manager,165
5,Yeah .,User Interface,166
5,so you can get a really good grip on it .,Industrial Designer,167
5,So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it .,Industrial Designer,167
5,It's it's a lot easier .,Industrial Designer,167
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,168
5,It grips automatically .,Project Manager,168
5,"Yeah , {vocalsound}",Project Manager,168
5,So m Yes .,Industrial Designer,169
5,okay .,Project Manager,170
5,But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .,Industrial Designer,171
5,"Okay , good .",Project Manager,172
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,173
5,Great .,User Interface,174
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,174
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,175
5,"Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .",User Interface,176
5,And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .,User Interface,176
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,177
5,"Way too much I think for our goal ,",Project Manager,177
5,Yeah .,User Interface,178
5,yeah .,Project Manager,179
5,"So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .",User Interface,180
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,181
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,182
5,"Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}",Project Manager,183
5,"Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,",Industrial Designer,184
5,yeah .,Project Manager,185
5,because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .,Industrial Designer,186
5,"Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design .",Industrial Designer,186
5,Uh these are the things we've looked at .,Industrial Designer,186
5,And of course I used the web to uh find my information .,Industrial Designer,186
5,"About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities .",Industrial Designer,186
5,We have the uncurved or flat case .,Industrial Designer,186
5,Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box .,Industrial Designer,186
5,I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .,Industrial Designer,186
5,{vocalsound} We have uh a curved one .,Industrial Designer,186
5,It's uh curved in two dimensions .,Industrial Designer,186
5,You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form .,Industrial Designer,186
5,So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .,Industrial Designer,186
5,Okay .,Project Manager,187
5,"Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension .",Industrial Designer,188
5,I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation .,Industrial Designer,188
5,"The the big remote control , something like that .",Industrial Designer,188
5,Yeah .,User Interface,189
5,Right .,User Interface,189
5,But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think .,Industrial Designer,190
5,Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing .,Industrial Designer,190
5,"We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery .",Industrial Designer,190
5,We can use wood and titanium .,Industrial Designer,190
5,"Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .",Industrial Designer,190
5,"And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source .",Industrial Designer,190
5,Which brings me to the different energy sources .,Industrial Designer,190
5,"{vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .",Industrial Designer,190
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,191
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,192
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,193
5,You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh,Industrial Designer,194
5,{vocalsound} Great .,User Interface,195
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,195
5,"Well , it would be very new to the market ,",Project Manager,196
5,I d,Industrial Designer,197
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,198
5,but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,199
5,"It would be very new ,",Industrial Designer,200
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,201
5,"but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .",Industrial Designer,202
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,203
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,203
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,204
5,"Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well ,",Industrial Designer,205
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,206
5,this is quite interesting .,Industrial Designer,207
5,Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply .,Industrial Designer,207
5,"So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're {disfmarker} you you have to um make some kind of energy {disfmarker} kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .",Industrial Designer,207
5,Like the watch .,User Interface,208
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,209
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,210
5,"{vocalsound} It have {disfmarker} it it has to move , that's the the sense of it .",Industrial Designer,211
5,And you can store the energy in the in the thing .,Industrial Designer,211
5,"I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .",Project Manager,212
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,213
5,It's very funny indeed .,Industrial Designer,213
5,"I mean solar is {disfmarker} of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .",Project Manager,214
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,215
5,Indeed .,Industrial Designer,215
5,Um hand dynamo {disfmarker},Project Manager,216
5,"But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}",User Interface,217
5,"Well , maybe m",Project Manager,218
5,"if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .",User Interface,219
5,"Yeah , I know .",Project Manager,220
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,221
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,221
5,You you walk,User Interface,222
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,223
5,and uh {disfmarker} but uh you {disfmarker} you're sitting on a couch .,User Interface,224
5,But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .,Industrial Designer,225
5,"{gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it .",Industrial Designer,225
5,But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .,Industrial Designer,225
5,"So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,",Industrial Designer,225
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,226
5,And wha,Project Manager,226
5,"well , m it might not work .",Industrial Designer,227
5,So that's something you have to keep in mind .,Industrial Designer,227
5,Okay .,Project Manager,228
5,"So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries",Industrial Designer,229
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,230
5,"and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .",Industrial Designer,231
5,"Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .",Project Manager,232
5,"Uh yes , it does .",Industrial Designer,233
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,234
5,I'll come to that later .,Industrial Designer,235
5,Okay .,Project Manager,236
5,"And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .",Industrial Designer,237
5,"{vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels .",Industrial Designer,237
5,And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .,Industrial Designer,237
5,So it's just like a mouse .,Industrial Designer,237
5,"You can scroll 'em , you can also push it .",Industrial Designer,237
5,"Um {vocalsound} uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,237
5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,238
5,"uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things .",Industrial Designer,239
5,"So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,239
5,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,240
5,"Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .",User Interface,240
5,{vocalsound} Yes .,Industrial Designer,241
5,That is possible too .,Industrial Designer,241
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,241
5,{gap} {disfmarker} But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels {disfmarker} I had some {disfmarker} I had some information about it too .,User Interface,242
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,243
5,I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .,User Interface,244
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,245
5,I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .,User Interface,246
5,"Well , mayb uh well , m me neither .",Industrial Designer,247
5,Maybe when you integrate some functions .,Industrial Designer,247
5,"This will be the remote , right ?",Project Manager,248
5,Yeah .,User Interface,249
5,Um with uh maybe a channel selector .,Project Manager,250
5,What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?,Project Manager,250
5,"Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,",User Interface,251
5,Uh it's do it's done before .,Industrial Designer,252
5,Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker},Project Manager,253
5,but {disfmarker},User Interface,254
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,255
5,"It's quite quite good , yes .",Industrial Designer,255
5,"But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for {disfmarker}",User Interface,256
5,Volume ?,Project Manager,257
5,"Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .",Industrial Designer,258
5,"A volume , okay .",User Interface,259
5,There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel .,Industrial Designer,260
5,You just use the wheel .,Industrial Designer,260
5,"Well , what about mute ?",Project Manager,261
5,About mute .,Industrial Designer,262
5,Thi i i m I guess uh th,Project Manager,263
5,"Well , yes .",Industrial Designer,264
5,this is my volume button .,Project Manager,265
5,And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker},Project Manager,265
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,266
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,266
5,"Well , okay .",Industrial Designer,266
5,"Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .",Industrial Designer,266
5,And click it to muten the device .,Project Manager,267
5,"Well , okay .",Industrial Designer,268
5,It's quite goods .,Industrial Designer,268
5,And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market .,Project Manager,269
5,So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .,Project Manager,269
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,270
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,270
5,So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .,Project Manager,271
5,Yeah .,User Interface,272
5,"Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ?",Project Manager,273
5,Uh scroll-wheel .,Project Manager,273
5,"Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,",Marketing,274
5,Wheel .,User Interface,275
5,it's obvious obviously new .,Marketing,276
5,So it might attract uh the young customers .,Marketing,276
5,Okay .,Project Manager,277
5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,278
5,"{vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios .",Industrial Designer,278
5,We use this .,Industrial Designer,278
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,279
5,"And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .",Industrial Designer,280
5,"Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .",Project Manager,281
5,So maybe it's not no {gap} .,Industrial Designer,282
5,"Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .",Project Manager,283
5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,284
5,"Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .",Industrial Designer,284
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,285
5,"I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel .",Project Manager,285
5,No .,Project Manager,285
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,285
5,It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} .,Industrial Designer,286
5,Well .,Industrial Designer,286
5,Uh something for uh Roo here .,Industrial Designer,286
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,286
5,"For you too , yeah .",Project Manager,287
5,"Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control .",User Interface,288
5,"You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .",User Interface,288
5,Wi within reach .,Industrial Designer,289
5,"Yes , you have to .",Industrial Designer,289
5,So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .,User Interface,290
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,291
5,{gap} yes .,Industrial Designer,291
5,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,291
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,291
5,Okay .,Project Manager,292
5,Sebastian .,Project Manager,292
5,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,292
5,"Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons .",Industrial Designer,293
5,There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays .,Industrial Designer,293
5,"There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .",Industrial Designer,293
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,294
5,There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things .,Industrial Designer,295
5,So that's a limitation .,Industrial Designer,295
5,"{vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware .",Industrial Designer,295
5,We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal .,Industrial Designer,295
5,"Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .",Industrial Designer,295
5,"And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me .",Industrial Designer,295
5,But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .,Industrial Designer,295
5,"{vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it .",User Interface,296
5,Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up .,User Interface,296
5,"Of mute , let's say mute .",User Interface,296
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,297
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,297
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,297
5,So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,297
5,"Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function",User Interface,298
5,okay .,Industrial Designer,299
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,300
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,301
5,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,301
5,"and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying .",User Interface,302
5,that's the sample sensor .,User Interface,302
5,"So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,",User Interface,302
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,303
5,"and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,304
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,305
5,It performs the action .,Project Manager,306
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,306
5,"Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .",User Interface,307
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,308
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,309
5,"So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .",User Interface,310
5,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,311
5,"Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for .",Industrial Designer,311
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,311
5,"This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought .",Industrial Designer,311
5,Um no op I'm not very sure .,Industrial Designer,311
5,"No , it's not in here .",Industrial Designer,311
5,"If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly .",Industrial Designer,311
5,If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version .,Industrial Designer,311
5,"And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .",Industrial Designer,311
5,Okay .,Project Manager,312
5,Uh well {disfmarker} uh,Project Manager,312
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,313
5,d did we already decide on the display ?,Project Manager,314
5,To {disfmarker},Project Manager,314
5,"Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .",Industrial Designer,315
5,Yeah .,User Interface,316
5,"Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display .",User Interface,316
5,No .,Project Manager,317
5,"Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,318
5,I I don't think either .,Industrial Designer,319
5,"'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,",User Interface,320
5,No .,Industrial Designer,321
5,I don't think you need it .,Industrial Designer,321
5,On screen display .,Project Manager,322
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,322
5,yeah .,User Interface,323
5,Okay,Project Manager,324
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,325
5,"Okay , well",Industrial Designer,325
5,th,Project Manager,326
5,"my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought .",Industrial Designer,327
5,"I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff .",Industrial Designer,327
5,So maybe we should think about uh wood finish .,Industrial Designer,327
5,Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy .,Industrial Designer,327
5,"It's more reliable , it's cheaper .",Industrial Designer,327
5,Okay .,Project Manager,328
5,Good .,Project Manager,328
5,So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing .,Industrial Designer,329
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,329
5,Kineti okay .,Project Manager,330
5,The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility .,Industrial Designer,331
5,"It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .",Industrial Designer,331
5,"Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,",Project Manager,332
5,"Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,",Industrial Designer,333
5,too {disfmarker},Project Manager,334
5,uh well .,Industrial Designer,335
5,yeah .,Project Manager,336
5,"It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .",Industrial Designer,337
5,"Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell .",Project Manager,338
5,That's no different .,Project Manager,338
5,But {disfmarker} Yes .,Industrial Designer,339
5,And I think it's more robust .,Industrial Designer,339
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,340
5,Okay .,Project Manager,340
5,It's more uh Uh it's more functional .,Industrial Designer,341
5,But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ?,User Interface,342
5,So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,342
5,"No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said .",Project Manager,343
5,The titanium thing uh we have to skip it .,Industrial Designer,344
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,344
5,He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference .,Project Manager,345
5,"But but yet , I understood that the market is different .",Project Manager,345
5,Okay .,User Interface,346
5,"Oh ,",User Interface,346
5,So um {disfmarker},Project Manager,347
5,sorry .,User Interface,348
5,Yeah .,User Interface,348
5,"So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,",Industrial Designer,349
5,Yeah .,User Interface,350
5,and we should uh use wood or something like that .,Industrial Designer,351
5,"No ,",Project Manager,352
5,And I would think {disfmarker},User Interface,353
5,And,Marketing,354
5,r,Project Manager,355
5,"yeah ,",Marketing,356
5,rubber with colours .,Project Manager,357
5,"the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood .",Marketing,358
5,"Oh okay , sorry .",Industrial Designer,359
5,So it it needs to be rubber .,Industrial Designer,359
5,No the {disfmarker},Marketing,360
5,Colourful and {disfmarker},Project Manager,361
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,362
5,"Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .",Marketing,363
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,364
5,"Okay , spongy materials .",Industrial Designer,365
5,Yeah .,Marketing,366
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,366
5,"Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .",Industrial Designer,367
5,And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?,User Interface,368
5,"So {disfmarker} Yes , they can .",Industrial Designer,369
5,"But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,369
5,"Okay , but we also {disfmarker} uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker {disfmarker}",User Interface,370
5,"Well , I'm not very sure .",Industrial Designer,371
5,Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,371
5,"oh ,",User Interface,372
5,"But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,",Project Manager,373
5,evalu,User Interface,374
5,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,375
5,"{gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .",Industrial Designer,376
5,I it's too dull .,Project Manager,377
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,377
5,I don't think c our customers will like it .,Industrial Designer,378
5,Yeah .,Marketing,379
5,"And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .",Industrial Designer,380
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,381
5,Okay .,Project Manager,381
5,Okay .,Project Manager,381
5,So I think this is the best of two worlds .,Industrial Designer,382
5,"Okay , what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ?",Project Manager,383
5,Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue .,Project Manager,383
5,Because it it's of cour,Project Manager,383
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,384
5,It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .,Industrial Designer,384
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,385
5,It's very unlogical .,Industrial Designer,386
5,{vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .,User Interface,387
5,Well {disfmarker},Project Manager,388
5,Well the there has to be some pointing at .,Industrial Designer,389
5,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,389
5,It depends also on your on your {disfmarker},Project Manager,390
5,"Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just {vocalsound} to the other wall .",User Interface,391
5,"Well , it depends on your walls actually .",Project Manager,392
5,"If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably {disfmarker} you're probably right .",Project Manager,392
5,Yeah .,User Interface,393
5,"But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um {disfmarker} yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .",Project Manager,394
5,"All lights get absorbed , yeah .",Industrial Designer,395
5,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,395
5,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,396
5,"Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .",Industrial Designer,397
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,398
5,So {vocalsound} it has an {disfmarker} it's easier .,Industrial Designer,399
5,Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample .,Industrial Designer,399
5,Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker .,Industrial Designer,399
5,Um with a with a regular chip .,Industrial Designer,399
5,And the regular chip .,User Interface,400
5,I think uh it gives us the advantage of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,401
5,And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels .,User Interface,402
5,Yeah .,User Interface,402
5,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,403
5,{vocalsound} I like the scroll wheels uh idea .,Project Manager,404
5,And uh skip {disfmarker} and skip the L_C_D_ part .,Industrial Designer,405
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,406
5,I don't think it it's any uh value added thing .,Industrial Designer,407
5,No .,User Interface,408
5,Think so too .,User Interface,408
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,409
5,"Well , it looks {disfmarker} uh yeah , well um",Project Manager,410
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,411
5,"according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,",Project Manager,412
5,Technology .,Industrial Designer,413
5,and I mean L_C_D_ is {disfmarker},Project Manager,414
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,415
5,It's not very flashy and new .,Industrial Designer,415
5,"well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard",Project Manager,416
5,Standard ?,Marketing,417
5,"than than {disfmarker} Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part .",Project Manager,418
5,That's the problem .,Project Manager,418
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,419
5,"Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,",Project Manager,420
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,421
5,because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .,Project Manager,422
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,423
5,"But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .",User Interface,424
5,Mm yeah .,Project Manager,425
5,Uh I think our customers will go insane .,Industrial Designer,426
5,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager,427
5,{vocalsound} It's it's too much .,Industrial Designer,428
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,429
5,"Okay , I I agree .",Project Manager,429
5,"I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or {disfmarker}",Project Manager,429
5,"Nah , um n no , I don't think so .",Marketing,430
5,M,Marketing,430
5,No ?,Project Manager,431
5,"Sebast uh nee , Roo ?",Project Manager,431
5,"{gap} Roo , do you have any other {disfmarker}",Project Manager,431
5,Um no .,User Interface,432
5,Nothing more .,User Interface,432
5,Nothing more .,Project Manager,433
5,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,433
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing,434
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,435
5,Uh the n the next phase will be um the um {disfmarker} not the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,435
5,Sebas,Project Manager,436
5,what is the next phase {gap} f Flores ?,Industrial Designer,437
5,"{vocalsound} Well , we we {vocalsound} need to describe uh decisions now .",Project Manager,438
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,439
5,So um,Project Manager,440
5,So i,Industrial Designer,441
5,"on the energy , well , we decided .",Project Manager,442
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,443
5,Chip .,Project Manager,444
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,445
5,The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve .,Project Manager,446
5,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer,447
5,User interface um,Project Manager,448
5,Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ?,User Interface,449
5,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,449
5,"Yes , they can work .",Industrial Designer,450
5,"Sorry , yeah .",User Interface,451
5,They cannot work with double-curved .,Industrial Designer,452
5,"Oh , sorry .",User Interface,453
5,Yeah .,User Interface,453
5,That's that's problem .,Industrial Designer,454
5,I'll check it for you .,Industrial Designer,454
5,Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product .,Project Manager,455
5,I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian .,Project Manager,455
5,"Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .",Project Manager,455
5,Yeah .,User Interface,456
5,{vocalsound} Keep it in mind .,Project Manager,457
5,"And um the buttons , well we talked about it now .",Project Manager,457
5,"The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel .",Project Manager,457
5,The user interface design .,Project Manager,457
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,458
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,458
5,"And for you , the product evaluation .",Project Manager,459
5,Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .,Project Manager,459
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,460
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,461
5,Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .,Project Manager,462
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,463
5,And I'm going uh to plan my holidays .,Project Manager,464
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,464
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,465
5,{vocalsound} The project drawing is for the next {disfmarker},User Interface,466
5,So you will be on the Bahamas .,Industrial Designer,467
5,Uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,467
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,468
5,"Yeah , it's it's uh {disfmarker} when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .",Project Manager,469
5,"Yeah , right .",User Interface,470
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,471
5,So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?,Industrial Designer,471
5,Yeah ?,Project Manager,472
5,I can .,Project Manager,472
5,Um maybe one of you could write it down .,Project Manager,472
5,I'll do .,Industrial Designer,473
5,Great .,Project Manager,474
5,Um {disfmarker} Uh you you need to help me .,Project Manager,474
5,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,474
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,475
5,W start with the casing .,Industrial Designer,475
5,"The casing is curved , single-curved .",Project Manager,476
5,Single-curved .,User Interface,477
5,"Okay , single-curved case .",Industrial Designer,478
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,478
5,What about the energy source ?,Industrial Designer,478
5,Traditional batteries uh and solar .,Project Manager,479
5,But can there be uh wor can they work together ?,User Interface,480
5,Or do we have to choose between them ?,User Interface,480
5,"No ,",Project Manager,481
5,'Cause if we have to choose {disfmarker},User Interface,482
5,they can be complementary .,Project Manager,483
5,Uh al al I uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,483
5,yeah ?,User Interface,484
5,I I think they can .,Industrial Designer,485
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,485
5,Okay .,User Interface,486
5,"Well , uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,487
5,Every device {disfmarker},Project Manager,488
5,What if not ?,User Interface,489
5,It it should be .,Industrial Designer,490
5,There should be really no problem .,Industrial Designer,490
5,Okay .,User Interface,491
5,They can be supplementary .,Industrial Designer,492
5,That's no problem .,Industrial Designer,492
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,493
5,"Okay , um",Project Manager,493
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,494
5,th,Project Manager,495
5,So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .,Industrial Designer,496
5,"Battery and solar , yeah .",Project Manager,497
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,498
5,What about uh the finishing of the case ?,Industrial Designer,498
5,We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?,Industrial Designer,498
5,"Yeah , with colourful rubber .",Project Manager,499
5,Yeah .,User Interface,500
5,"Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .",Project Manager,501
5,"Okay , and I think we should use the company colours .",Industrial Designer,502
5,Something like black and red .,Industrial Designer,502
5,{gap} uh black and yellow .,Industrial Designer,502
5,Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow .,Project Manager,503
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,503
5,Grey and yellow .,User Interface,504
5,"Grey yellow , okay .",Industrial Designer,505
5,"Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .",User Interface,506
5,"Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful .",Project Manager,507
5,"Except for the yellow of course ,",Project Manager,507
5,Hmm .,Marketing,508
5,but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .,Project Manager,509
5,"Oh , I think it's uh {disfmarker} it's not very dull .",Industrial Designer,510
5,It's quite modern actually .,Industrial Designer,510
5,Don't you think ?,Industrial Designer,510
5,"Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .",Project Manager,511
5,I believe the {disfmarker} But you have already um {disfmarker} you must have a red uh on and off button .,User Interface,512
5,And um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface,512
5,"Well , it it doesn't have to be red .",Project Manager,513
5,Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for .,Project Manager,513
5,"Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image",Project Manager,513
5,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,514
5,"or or {disfmarker} I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .",Project Manager,515
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,516
5,Or black and yellow .,Marketing,517
5,"Black and yellow , yeah .",Project Manager,518
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,519
5,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",Industrial Designer,520
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,521
5,but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device .,Industrial Designer,522
5,Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself .,Industrial Designer,522
5,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,522
5,"Well , there is .",User Interface,523
5,"{vocalsound} Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,",User Interface,523
5,"Oh , I've read .",Industrial Designer,524
5,Yeah .,Marketing,525
5,with {gap} and uh {disfmarker},User Interface,526
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,527
5,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer,527
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} No .,User Interface,528
5,but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques .,Industrial Designer,529
5,They're actually very slow in its techniques .,Industrial Designer,529
5,"Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .",Project Manager,530
5,So {disfmarker} So I'm afraid it's not possible .,Industrial Designer,531
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,532
5,Okay .,Project Manager,532
5,Um more f more more decisions we made .,Project Manager,532
5,Um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,532
5,A scroll-wheel .,User Interface,533
5,The scroll-heel .,Project Manager,534
5,"Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .",Project Manager,534
5,"Voice recognition , of course .",User Interface,535
5,"Okay , so scroll-wheel .",Industrial Designer,536
5,"But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .",Industrial Designer,536
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,537
5,"And th the {disfmarker} they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .",Industrial Designer,538
5,Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two .,Project Manager,539
5,{vocalsound},Project Manager,539
5,{vocalsound},Marketing,540
5,What what did you say ?,User Interface,541
5,"Well uh you can use {disfmarker} well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .",Industrial Designer,542
5,Yeah .,User Interface,543
5,So it has th the spongy uh feel also .,Industrial Designer,544
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,545
5,"Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons .",User Interface,546
5,In the rubber .,User Interface,546
5,{vocalsound} I think rubber is nice .,Project Manager,547
5,"Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i",Project Manager,547
5,"Yeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .",User Interface,548
5,{gap} .,Project Manager,549
5,"What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .",User Interface,550
5,Uh is that {disfmarker} uh does our our supplier say so ?,Project Manager,551
5,"It is not uh something uh {disfmarker} it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from {disfmarker}",User Interface,552
5,Uh didn't {disfmarker} did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?,Marketing,553
5,"No , but but uh it {disfmarker}",User Interface,554
5,'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .,Marketing,555
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,556
5,You could place a {disfmarker} um uh this this would be the button .,Project Manager,556
5,There {disfmarker} the icons .,Marketing,557
5,"The scroll-wheel , I mean .",Project Manager,558
5,And you could place the indica th th the signals the {disfmarker},Project Manager,558
5,"Yeah , b yeah .",User Interface,559
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,560
5,"Yeah , that's possible ,",User Interface,561
5,That's okay .,Industrial Designer,562
5,So you don't touch the icons that much .,Marketing,563
5,but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .,User Interface,564
5,"So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .",User Interface,564
5,"No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or {disfmarker} But it's into the rubber .",Project Manager,565
5,Yeah .,User Interface,566
5,"Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .",User Interface,566
5,"Yeah , but this is on the pla",Project Manager,567
5,You have to draw the {disfmarker},User Interface,568
5,"Yes , the signs .",Industrial Designer,569
5,"yeah , I know .",Project Manager,570
5,Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .,Project Manager,570
5,"Yeah , it's on the cover .",User Interface,571
5,So if you uh {disfmarker} You just move the problem .,User Interface,571
5,What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?,Project Manager,572
5,Uh I see what you mean .,Industrial Designer,573
5,"Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing .",Industrial Designer,573
5,So maybe they can combine these two .,Industrial Designer,573
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,574
5,"Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess .",Project Manager,574
5,A plastic cover with rubber finishing .,Project Manager,574
5,"I mean , this is this is the finishing .",Project Manager,574
5,This is um what's on the edge .,Project Manager,574
5,What you feel .,Project Manager,574
5,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,575
5,"But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber .",Project Manager,576
5,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,577
5,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager,578
5,"Well , I'm I'm not so sure ,",Industrial Designer,579
5,Y uh can you separate these uh these {disfmarker},User Interface,580
5,"I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber .",Industrial Designer,581
5,"So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .",Industrial Designer,581
5,"{vocalsound} I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?",Project Manager,582
5,{vocalsound} I think both .,Industrial Designer,583
5,"I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .",Project Manager,584
5,I do .,User Interface,585
5,{vocalsound},User Interface,585
5,I do .,Industrial Designer,586
5,Or the s uh the sideways .,User Interface,587
5,I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,588
5,Or the the back .,User Interface,589
5,Or the back .,User Interface,589
5,"Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways .",Project Manager,590
5,"The side , but do you touch between the the {disfmarker} these buttons ?",Project Manager,590
5,"I think {disfmarker} Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch .",User Interface,591
5,So you just have it in your hand completely or or {disfmarker} i you play with it .,User Interface,591
5,Okay .,Project Manager,592
5,"Well , we do not have very much time uh left .",Project Manager,592
5,Um I guess you two have to figure that out .,Project Manager,592
5,"I'm going to leave the decision to you ,",Project Manager,592
5,Yeah .,User Interface,593
5,"um because you have to make its prototype , and um {disfmarker} yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,594
5,Yeah .,User Interface,595
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,596
5,so I'm going to leave it {disfmarker} the decision with you .,Project Manager,597
5,"Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?",Project Manager,597
5,Um not quite .,Industrial Designer,598
5,Um what about uh the chips ?,Industrial Designer,598
5,We use the regular chip ?,Industrial Designer,598
5,Regular .,User Interface,599
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,600
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,601
5,And {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,602
5,Use with {gap} .,User Interface,603
5,"Well {disfmarker} no , I think that's about it .",Industrial Designer,604
5,Yes .,Industrial Designer,604
5,Okay .,Project Manager,605
5,With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions .,Project Manager,605
5,The chip is is not really {disfmarker},Project Manager,605
5,The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ .,Industrial Designer,606
5,That's all .,Industrial Designer,606
5,"Okay , well .",Project Manager,607
5,And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ .,Industrial Designer,608
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,609
5,Okay .,Project Manager,609
5,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,610
5,"Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished .",Project Manager,611
5,Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um {disfmarker},Project Manager,611
5,{gap} .,User Interface,612
5,For the finishing touch .,User Interface,612
5,Yeah ?,Project Manager,613
5,"Yeah , um if you write {disfmarker} wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?",Project Manager,613
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,614
5,Okay .,Industrial Designer,614
5,Uh yeah .,User Interface,615
5,Yeah .,Project Manager,616
5,But um Sebastian has everything .,User Interface,617
5,"I know , but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker}",Project Manager,618
5,I'll put it online .,Industrial Designer,619
5,Great .,Project Manager,620
5,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager,620

6,"Alright , okay .",Project Manager,4
6,"Okay , that's fine .",Project Manager,4
6,{vocalsound} Oh God .,Marketing,5
6,Are we done ?,Project Manager,6
6,"Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place .",Project Manager,6
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,7
6,"Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?",Project Manager,8
6,"Uh , no that's okay ,",Marketing,9
6,"Okay , um {vocalsound}",Project Manager,10
6,sorry .,Marketing,11
6,"I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,",Project Manager,12
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,13
6,"um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .",Project Manager,14
6,Sorry .,User Interface,15
6,"Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone .",Project Manager,16
6,"We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .",Project Manager,16
6,"Um , our budget would have to affect um {disfmarker} try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of {disfmarker} oh oh you can see it , okay {vocalsound} .",Project Manager,16
6,Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .,Project Manager,16
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,17
6,"Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer .",Project Manager,18
6,"We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that .",Project Manager,18
6,Okay .,Project Manager,18
6,"Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ?",Project Manager,18
6,"Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information ,",Marketing,19
6,"No that's fine , that's fine .",Project Manager,20
6,{gap},Project Manager,20
6,is that okay ?,Marketing,21
6,"Okay , yeah I'll go first .",Industrial Designer,22
6,Can I grab the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,22
6,Unplug me .,Project Manager,23
6,Thanks .,Industrial Designer,24
6,What do I have to press ?,Industrial Designer,24
6,"Oh , F_ eight ?",Industrial Designer,24
6,"Um , F_N_ function F_ eight .",Project Manager,25
6,"Oh right , yeah .",Industrial Designer,26
6,Okay .,Industrial Designer,26
6,Maybe {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,26
6,Yep .,User Interface,27
6,Yep there we go .,Industrial Designer,28
6,"Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .",Industrial Designer,28
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,29
6,"'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so .",Industrial Designer,30
6,What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ?,Industrial Designer,30
6,"Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .",Industrial Designer,30
6,"Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that .",Industrial Designer,30
6,"But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really .",Industrial Designer,30
6,"So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,30
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,31
6,"Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information .",Industrial Designer,32
6,"Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .",Industrial Designer,32
6,"Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .",Industrial Designer,32
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,33
6,"Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,",Marketing,33
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,34
6,Yeah sure .,Industrial Designer,35
6,is that appropriate ?,Marketing,36
6,You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?,Marketing,36
6,"Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,",Industrial Designer,37
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,38
6,they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .,Industrial Designer,39
6,"Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?",Marketing,40
6,Yeah the the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,41
6,Okay .,User Interface,42
6,They are .,Project Manager,43
6,well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption,Industrial Designer,44
6,Oh I see .,Marketing,45
6,and how much you need to send the data across .,Industrial Designer,46
6,Okay .,Marketing,47
6,"Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .",Industrial Designer,48
6,"Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .",Industrial Designer,48
6,"{vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine .",Industrial Designer,48
6,And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer .,Industrial Designer,48
6,And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .,Industrial Designer,48
6,{gap},User Interface,49
6,"It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment .",Industrial Designer,50
6,"And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good .",Industrial Designer,50
6,"Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,",Industrial Designer,50
6,Mm .,Marketing,51
6,Mm .,Marketing,51
6,I {disfmarker} th that was just sort of a general point there .,Industrial Designer,52
6,Mm .,Marketing,53
6,{vocalsound} And that's uh {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer,54
6,"That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .",Marketing,55
6,"Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,",Industrial Designer,56
6,"Okay , thank you very much .",Project Manager,57
6,so if you wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,58
6,"Um , would you like to continue on from that ?",Project Manager,59
6,Yep .,User Interface,60
6,Ooh .,Industrial Designer,61
6,'Kay .,User Interface,62
6,It can be {disfmarker},User Interface,62
6,"Or , maybe move the laptop over .",Project Manager,63
6,"okay , that's okay with me .",User Interface,64
6,{gap} further .,User Interface,64
6,{gap},User Interface,64
6,{gap},Project Manager,65
6,Oops .,User Interface,66
6,Why's it not working ?,User Interface,66
6,"F_ eight , right ?",User Interface,66
6,F_ function .,Project Manager,67
6,Function F_ eight yeah .,Industrial Designer,68
6,Okay .,User Interface,69
6,Mm why's it in the right ?,User Interface,69
6,No .,Marketing,70
6,"The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ?",Marketing,70
6,No .,Marketing,70
6,"Yeah , it's connecting {gap} .",User Interface,71
6,"No , no yeah it's just {gap} .",Industrial Designer,72
6,Meter adjusting .,Marketing,73
6,{gap} okay .,User Interface,74
6,"Oh , there {gap} .",Project Manager,75
6,Yeah .,User Interface,76
6,"Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,",User Interface,76
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,77
6,"but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .",User Interface,78
6,"So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible .",User Interface,78
6,"And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .",User Interface,78
6,"But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together .",User Interface,78
6,So what the concept is to have a flip-top model .,User Interface,78
6,"The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .",User Interface,78
6,So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people .,User Interface,78
6,Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user .,User Interface,78
6,As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ?,User Interface,78
6,"Yeah ,",User Interface,78
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,79
6,"with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly .",User Interface,80
6,"Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that .",User Interface,80
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,81
6,So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .,User Interface,82
6,Mm .,Marketing,83
6,"Uh any comments like , if you want ?",User Interface,84
6,'Kay .,Project Manager,85
6,"Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,",Project Manager,85
6,Okay .,User Interface,86
6,"okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,87
6,Yeah sure .,Industrial Designer,88
6,'Kay .,Marketing,89
6,"Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange .",Project Manager,90
6,"Oh , God .",Project Manager,90
6,"Right , okay .",Project Manager,90
6,I think you'll have to {disfmarker},User Interface,91
6,Have I got to keep this here ?,Marketing,92
6,You can't {disfmarker},User Interface,93
6,Does it matter ?,Marketing,94
6,It'll have to {disfmarker} this can't be pulled .,User Interface,95
6,I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ?,Marketing,96
6,We just do the best we can .,Project Manager,97
6,"Uh , whoops .",Marketing,98
6,You'll have to push it a bit more .,User Interface,99
6,Will it manage ?,Marketing,100
6,"Bit more ,",Marketing,100
6,Yep .,User Interface,101
6,oh dear .,Marketing,102
6,{vocalsound},Marketing,102
6,Yeah this is more than enough .,User Interface,103
6,Okay .,User Interface,103
6,"There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,104
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,105
6,Oh .,Marketing,106
6,{vocalsound},Marketing,106
6,There we go .,Industrial Designer,107
6,Is that okay ?,Marketing,108
6,Yeah I think you can pull it out now .,User Interface,109
6,"Thank you ,",Marketing,110
6,{gap},User Interface,111
6,just pull it closer a little bit .,Marketing,112
6,Uh you should be able to {gap} and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,113
6,"Yeah , you might .",Project Manager,114
6,"yeah , there you go .",Industrial Designer,115
6,"Get it right over , okay , thank you .",Marketing,116
6,Ah .,Project Manager,117
6,Look at that .,Project Manager,117
6,"Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .",Marketing,118
6,"{vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .",Marketing,118
6,"{vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here .",Marketing,118
6,"The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there .",Marketing,118
6,"Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .",Marketing,118
6,"Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .",Marketing,118
6,"Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .",Marketing,118
6,"For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,",Marketing,118
6,Yeah .,User Interface,119
6,so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .,Marketing,120
6,So again there's power implications there .,Marketing,120
6,"{vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .",Marketing,120
6,Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control .,Marketing,120
6,"Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .",Marketing,120
6,"Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions .",Marketing,120
6,"Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .",Marketing,120
6,You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .,Marketing,120
6,"Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .",Marketing,120
6,"Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly .",Marketing,120
6,"Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups .",Marketing,120
6,"So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .",Marketing,120
6,"{vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,",Marketing,120
6,'Kay .,User Interface,121
6,"but I think I'll just keep it simple ,",Marketing,122
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,123
6,"if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,",Marketing,124
6,{gap} That's fine .,User Interface,125
6,Okay .,Project Manager,126
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,126
6,Okay .,Industrial Designer,127
6,is that okay ?,Marketing,128
6,"Right , um",Project Manager,129
6,Huh .,Industrial Designer,130
6,"we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,",Project Manager,131
6,Okay .,User Interface,132
6,um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now .,Project Manager,133
6,"Um {vocalsound} our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it limits the cost for us ,",Project Manager,133
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,134
6,but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .,Project Manager,135
6,"Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?",Marketing,136
6,"It says for T_V_ only , so {vocalsound} looks like it's just {disfmarker}",Project Manager,137
6,Just channel-hopping .,Marketing,138
6,"yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but {vocalsound} I don't know , what do you think ?",Project Manager,139
6,"It just said , for T_V_ only .",Project Manager,139
6,"But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .",Project Manager,139
6,Would that imply video use ?,Marketing,140
6,T yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer,141
6,I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g,Industrial Designer,141
6,I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?,Project Manager,142
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,143
6,If yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,143
6,"Mm-hmm , yes .",Marketing,144
6,"and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .",Industrial Designer,145
6,Mm .,Project Manager,146
6,I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming .,Project Manager,146
6,{vocalsound} Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?,User Interface,147
6,Yes .,Marketing,148
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,149
6,"Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,",Marketing,150
6,Ten perc,User Interface,151
6,Mm .,Project Manager,152
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,153
6,"I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on",Marketing,154
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,155
6,and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound},Marketing,156
6,Okay .,User Interface,157
6,Hmm .,Project Manager,158
6,Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing,Industrial Designer,159
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,160
6,Pens,User Interface,161
6,and they're not that great anyway .,Industrial Designer,162
6,"In fact I've just called up that table there ,",Marketing,163
6,"Alright , okay .",Industrial Designer,164
6,"we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate .",Marketing,165
6,"Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?",Marketing,165
6,"Alright , okay .",Industrial Designer,166
6,"So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there ,",Marketing,167
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,168
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,169
6,"and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .",Marketing,170
6,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,171
6,Yeah but um on on that again I just thought {disfmarker} 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is,Industrial Designer,172
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,173
6,bu,Project Manager,174
6,Oh yeah .,Marketing,175
6,so I thought that could be quite a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,176
6,Right .,Marketing,177
6,"We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing",Project Manager,178
6,Mm .,Marketing,179
6,"um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,",Project Manager,180
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,181
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,181
6,"maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps",Project Manager,182
6,Okay .,User Interface,183
6,"and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,",Project Manager,184
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,185
6,Yes .,Marketing,186
6,That's a super idea .,Marketing,186
6,but that's {disfmarker} that sounds a lot cheaper to me .,Project Manager,187
6,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,188
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,188
6,Yeah .,Marketing,189
6,Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .,Project Manager,190
6,"Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing .",Project Manager,190
6,"Um , people paying more for it to look good .",Project Manager,190
6,"Um , we need to focus on that as well .",Project Manager,190
6,"Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty",Marketing,191
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,192
6,and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market .,Marketing,193
6,"What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,",Marketing,193
6,Mm .,Project Manager,194
6,you get the idea .,Marketing,195
6,It's it's gonna vary around the world .,Marketing,195
6,"At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .",Marketing,195
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,196
6,"So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs {gap} ?",User Interface,197
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,198
6,Sure .,User Interface,199
6,Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs,Industrial Designer,200
6,Alright .,User Interface,201
6,I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .,Industrial Designer,202
6,Right .,User Interface,203
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,204
6,The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .,User Interface,205
6,Just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,206
6,Yeah .,Marketing,207
6,"yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,208
6,Mm .,Marketing,209
6,So {disfmarker},User Interface,210
6,"What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons ,",Project Manager,211
6,Yeah .,User Interface,212
6,"um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers",Project Manager,213
6,'Kay .,Industrial Designer,214
6,"Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer,214
6,yeah ?,Project Manager,215
6,"Um so you {disfmarker} it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,215
6,{gap},User Interface,216
6,"No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to {disfmarker} you don't actually have to press them you just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,217
6,"You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .",Project Manager,218
6,{gap},User Interface,219
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,220
6,"Um , think that might appeal {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,",Project Manager,221
6,Mm .,Marketing,222
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,222
6,trendy kind of a thing .,Project Manager,223
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,224
6,Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def,Marketing,225
6,"Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for",Project Manager,226
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,227
6,"and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,228
6,"Mm-hmm , mm .",Marketing,229
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,230
6,"But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big",Industrial Designer,230
6,Were too big .,Project Manager,231
6,because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands,Industrial Designer,232
6,Mm .,Project Manager,233
6,so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .,Industrial Designer,234
6,"Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .",User Interface,235
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,236
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,236
6,"So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .",User Interface,237
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,238
6,Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control,User Interface,239
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,240
6,"and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .",User Interface,241
6,I think we have to design one product,Project Manager,242
6,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,243
6,Huh .,Industrial Designer,243
6,and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh,Project Manager,244
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,245
6,"in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .",Project Manager,246
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,247
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,248
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,249
6,"Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .",Marketing,250
6,"It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .",Project Manager,251
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,252
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,253
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,253
6,"I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that .",Marketing,253
6,"Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .",Marketing,253
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,254
6,"I'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,",Marketing,255
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,256
6,this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .,Marketing,257
6,I {disfmarker} yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause {disfmarker} without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel,Industrial Designer,258
6,Mm .,Marketing,259
6,"I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .",Marketing,259
6,and it becomes {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,260
6,"Or a speech recognition ,",Project Manager,261
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,262
6,"Yeah , speech recognition ,",Industrial Designer,262
6,Yeah .,Marketing,263
6,"which is extremely expensive ,",Project Manager,264
6,but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,265
6,I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .,Project Manager,266
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,267
6,Yes .,Marketing,268
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,268
6,"Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later .",Marketing,268
6,Do we really have to go for everyone right away ?,Marketing,268
6,Um .,Marketing,268
6,We could focus on the biggest market .,User Interface,269
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,270
6,Mm .,Marketing,271
6,If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?,User Interface,272
6,Ge uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,273
6,"And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .",Marketing,274
6,We are {disfmarker} we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well .,Project Manager,275
6,"That they want um it to be fashionable ,",Project Manager,275
6,{vocalsound},Marketing,276
6,they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume {disfmarker} associate that with the older generations .,Project Manager,277
6,Mm .,Marketing,278
6,"Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,",Project Manager,279
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,280
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,281
6,Mm-hmm {vocalsound} .,Marketing,282
6,"but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .",Project Manager,283
6,Mm .,Marketing,284
6,Mm .,Marketing,284
6,"I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate",Marketing,284
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,285
6,"and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first {disfmarker} it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .",Marketing,286
6,"Okay , so the remote control functions .",Project Manager,287
6,"Um we've got the T_V_ ,",Project Manager,287
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,288
6,"we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,",Project Manager,289
6,Video plus .,Industrial Designer,290
6,yes .,Project Manager,291
6,"We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that {disfmarker}",Project Manager,291
6,Yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer,292
6,"I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um",Project Manager,293
6,Mm .,Marketing,294
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,295
6,"because you've got your general record anyway so if you {disfmarker} there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in",Project Manager,296
6,Just whack in the number .,Industrial Designer,297
6,"and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,",Project Manager,298
6,And you w {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,299
6,it's just a number .,Project Manager,300
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,301
6,"And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,",Industrial Designer,301
6,No .,Project Manager,302
6,"you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,",Industrial Designer,303
6,You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .,Project Manager,304
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,305
6,"Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful {vocalsound} .",Marketing,306
6,It is,Project Manager,307
6,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,308
6,"after um {disfmarker} if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards",Project Manager,309
6,It's not {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,310
6,and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth,Project Manager,311
6,"Ah , hmm .",Marketing,312
6,"so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,",Project Manager,313
6,Right .,Marketing,314
6,um and it has been around for quite a long time .,Project Manager,315
6,It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .,Industrial Designer,316
6,No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that {disfmarker},Project Manager,317
6,Superb .,Marketing,318
6,Mm .,Marketing,318
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,319
6,Yes .,Marketing,320
6,Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it {disfmarker} you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on,Industrial Designer,321
6,Mm .,Project Manager,322
6,Right .,Marketing,323
6,and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .,Industrial Designer,324
6,"Excellent , mm-hmm .",Marketing,325
6,So that {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer,326
6,Mm .,Marketing,327
6,But just to have that function would be would be really good .,Industrial Designer,328
6,Right .,Marketing,329
6,Okay so {disfmarker},Project Manager,330
6,"Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , {gap} to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,",Marketing,331
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,332
6,"they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .",Marketing,333
6,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,334
6,"Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ?",Marketing,335
6,"Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?",Marketing,335
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,336
6,{vocalsound},Project Manager,337
6,But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um {disfmarker} the companies who uh who you deal with have actually {disfmarker} they've they've got an obligation to to help you out,Industrial Designer,338
6,Mm .,Marketing,339
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,339
6,and also {disfmarker} I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,340
6,Right .,Marketing,341
6,"The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it .",Project Manager,342
6,"Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?",Project Manager,342
6,Alright .,Marketing,343
6,{vocalsound} Yes,Marketing,343
6,{vocalsound},User Interface,344
6,"{vocalsound} If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel ,",Marketing,345
6,{gap},Industrial Designer,346
6,"but I mean for {disfmarker} if there were any more {disfmarker} or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video ,",Marketing,347
6,I think so .,Project Manager,348
6,"Yeah , I mean {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,349
6,"we're not gonna put any {disfmarker} {vocalsound} okay , just a thought .",Marketing,350
6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,351
6,I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .,Industrial Designer,352
6,Instruction manuals .,Project Manager,353
6,"But I mean they're {disfmarker} there's customer service ,",Project Manager,353
6,Okay .,Marketing,354
6,there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to,Project Manager,355
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,356
6,"Department , yeah .",Industrial Designer,356
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,357
6,Sure .,Marketing,357
6,"and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um .",Project Manager,358
6,Mm .,Marketing,359
6,Right .,User Interface,360
6,Yeah .,Marketing,361
6,"I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to {disfmarker} for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,",User Interface,362
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,363
6,but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .,User Interface,364
6,And they're {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,365
6,Not for such simple functions,Marketing,366
6,"yeah , they should be f yeah .",Industrial Designer,367
6,"because we're focusing on that ,",Marketing,368
6,Mm .,Project Manager,369
6,But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible,Project Manager,369
6,yes okay .,Marketing,370
6,Simple .,User Interface,371
6,because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .,Project Manager,372
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,373
6,Mm .,Marketing,374
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,375
6,"Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .",Marketing,376
6,"It does ,",Project Manager,377
6,It's the uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,378
6,you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong,Project Manager,379
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,380
6,"and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about .",Project Manager,381
6,"Sure , okay .",Marketing,382
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,383
6,"Um , what other functions ?",Project Manager,384
6,"We need {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about {disfmarker} c 'cause you've got the dilemma between {disfmarker} oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about .",Project Manager,384
6,"Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?",Project Manager,384
6,"Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,385
6,"Well they la they they last quite a long time ,",Project Manager,386
6,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,387
6,"and if you had uh {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,",Project Manager,388
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,389
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,390
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,391
6,but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .,Project Manager,392
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,393
6,"Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .",Project Manager,394
6,Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,395
6,"Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay .",Project Manager,396
6,Yeah on that as well so .,Industrial Designer,397
6,So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?,User Interface,398
6,S,Project Manager,399
6,Yeah,Industrial Designer,400
6,Yes .,Project Manager,401
6,some sort of docking station or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,402
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,403
6,Rechargeable with a docking station .,Project Manager,404
6,yeah .,Industrial Designer,405
6,So the rechargeable which would be your field .,Project Manager,406
6,"Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,",Industrial Designer,407
6,Okay .,Project Manager,408
6,and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .,Industrial Designer,409
6,Right .,User Interface,410
6,"Yes ,",Project Manager,411
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,412
6,which it is cheaper in the long run as well .,Project Manager,413
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,414
6,"Um , th the shape you got trendy .",Project Manager,415
6,"I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either ,",Project Manager,415
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,416
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,417
6,"because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how much you try and make it simple ,",Project Manager,418
6,Mm .,Marketing,419
6,um {disfmarker},Project Manager,420
6,"And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,",Marketing,421
6,They do .,Project Manager,422
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,423
6,"these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface .",Marketing,424
6,"We definitely {disfmarker} an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .",Marketing,424
6,Okay so we've got a flip-screen .,Project Manager,425
6,Okay .,User Interface,426
6,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,427
6,What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back .,User Interface,428
6,"Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate .",User Interface,428
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,429
6,"That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,",User Interface,430
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,431
6,"and you don't have to {disfmarker} you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .",User Interface,432
6,"Slightly curved , curved .",Marketing,433
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,434
6,Okay .,Project Manager,435
6,G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like .,User Interface,436
6,So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't,User Interface,436
6,Mm .,Marketing,437
6,'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .,Project Manager,438
6,y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your {disfmarker},User Interface,439
6,Mm .,Marketing,440
6,"the way you h hold of {disfmarker} it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .",User Interface,441
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,442
6,Okay .,Project Manager,443
6,I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .,User Interface,444
6,Can you look into the company logo ?,Project Manager,445
6,"Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .",Project Manager,445
6,Current .,User Interface,446
6,"I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,",Project Manager,447
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,448
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,448
6,"um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design ,",Project Manager,449
6,{gap},Marketing,450
6,while also making it quite different from anything else that's there .,Project Manager,451
6,We could look in at that but {disfmarker} Mm .,User Interface,452
6,"What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells ,",User Interface,452
6,I mean look at the mobile .,Marketing,453
6,"logo could become as {disfmarker} you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .",User Interface,454
6,Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different .,Project Manager,455
6,"I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that sounds a really attractive idea ,",Marketing,456
6,A sea shell ?,User Interface,457
6,"I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of {disfmarker} yeah and that opens out into your flip-top .",Marketing,458
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,459
6,"Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think .",Marketing,460
6,I think it's a really nice idea,Marketing,460
6,Yeah we could look in at that .,User Interface,461
6,"and plus you can get {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know even though we're using plastic , you can still {disfmarker} I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .",Marketing,462
6,"Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias .",Project Manager,463
6,You could have different kind of casings .,Project Manager,463
6,Mm .,Industrial Designer,464
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,465
6,So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and {disfmarker},Project Manager,466
6,Yeah .,Marketing,467
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,467
6,"Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa",Marketing,467
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,468
6,and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't {disfmarker} not gonna lose it so much {vocalsound} either .,Marketing,469
6,It's easier to {disfmarker} bit nice to handle .,Marketing,469
6,Mm .,Project Manager,470
6,"Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are {disfmarker} whichever appeals the most like ,",User Interface,471
6,Okay .,Project Manager,472
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,473
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,474
6,that could be the most common design .,User Interface,475
6,Okay .,Project Manager,476
6,Okay .,Marketing,477
6,"But we can like think of five , six designs .",User Interface,478
6,Okay .,Project Manager,479
6,"Right , I think we have to round it up , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,479
6,Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .,Marketing,480
6,Sure .,Project Manager,481
6,"So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video ,",Marketing,482
6,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,483
6,"our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .",Marketing,484
6,"That was um in cutting down the number {disfmarker} that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date {disfmarker}",Project Manager,485
6,Right .,Marketing,486
6,Right .,Marketing,486
6,"Right , so when they press for programming you {disfmarker} it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ?",Marketing,486
6,"So that they have a look at the guide and {disfmarker} Or was {disfmarker} is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just {disfmarker} that was an add-on feature ?",Marketing,486
6,"{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .",Project Manager,487
6,Uh-huh .,Marketing,488
6,Right .,Marketing,488
6,"Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?",Marketing,488
6,"Um it could be it c It {disfmarker} yes ,",Project Manager,489
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,490
6,"it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,",Project Manager,491
6,Right .,Marketing,492
6,"you know , drawing attention to that .",Project Manager,493
6,"And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .",Project Manager,493
6,"Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .",Marketing,494
6,Yeah .,Project Manager,495
6,Was there anything else there that we {disfmarker} in the new new project requirements ?,Marketing,496
6,{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,497
6,Yeah .,User Interface,498
6,{gap},User Interface,498
6,"We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .",Project Manager,499
6,Yeah .,User Interface,500
6,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,501
6,"That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at ,",Marketing,501
6,Yes .,Project Manager,502
6,Yes .,Project Manager,502
6,what preference {disfmarker} so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .,Marketing,503
6,"And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .",Project Manager,504
6,"For detection , right .",User Interface,505
6,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,506
6,Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible .,Project Manager,507
6,"But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um .",Project Manager,507
6,I think {disfmarker},Project Manager,507
6,"Yep ,",User Interface,508
6,"Yep ,",Project Manager,509
6,I think {disfmarker},User Interface,510
6,and different from what's out there .,Project Manager,511
6,"Yep , I think that's us .",Project Manager,511
6,Okay .,Marketing,512
6,True .,User Interface,513
6,What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?,Marketing,514
6,Okay .,Industrial Designer,515
6,Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ?,Marketing,516
6,"I think you might get guidance , but um I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing ,",Project Manager,517
6,Okay .,Marketing,518
6,"u um , they're {disfmarker} everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .",Project Manager,519
6,Okay .,Marketing,520
6,Um .,Project Manager,521
6,Oops .,User Interface,522
6,"Whoops , questionnaire four .",Marketing,523
6,We should f,User Interface,524
6,"Yes , right .",Project Manager,525
6,Okay .,Project Manager,525
6,I think it's time for us to get back to {disfmarker},User Interface,526
6,'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .,Marketing,527
6,"Right , okay .",Project Manager,528
6,"I think you can email me , if there's any more questions .",Project Manager,528
6,Um and I'll be able to not answer them .,Project Manager,528
7,"Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch .",Project Manager,1
7,Um {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,1
7,{vocalsound},User Interface,2
7,Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .,Project Manager,3
7,{vocalsound} 'Scuse me .,User Interface,4
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,4
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,5
7,Bless you .,Marketing,6
7,"Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting .",Project Manager,7
7,"Um , {vocalsound} under marketing we targeted our audience , and {disfmarker} Um , yeah .",Project Manager,7
7,That was {vocalsound} generally {vocalsound} {disfmarker} how helpful that was .,Project Manager,7
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,8
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,9
7,"Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're {disfmarker} Right , um {disfmarker} So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what {disfmarker} where you've come from our last time .",Project Manager,10
7,Does everyone have presentations ?,Project Manager,10
7,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,11
7,Yeah .,Marketing,12
7,Okay .,Project Manager,13
7,Yes .,Industrial Designer,14
7,Yes .,User Interface,15
7,Would anybody like to go first ?,Project Manager,16
7,Sure .,Industrial Designer,17
7,Okay .,Project Manager,18
7,So I've been looking at the components design .,Industrial Designer,19
7,Um .,Industrial Designer,19
7,Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .,Industrial Designer,19
7,"Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard .",Industrial Designer,19
7,"Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .",Industrial Designer,19
7,"And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .",Industrial Designer,19
7,But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out .,Industrial Designer,19
7,"Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel .",Industrial Designer,19
7,The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it .,Industrial Designer,19
7,"Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard .",Industrial Designer,19
7,And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .,Industrial Designer,19
7,So we have some material options .,Industrial Designer,19
7,"Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .",Industrial Designer,19
7,"Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .",Industrial Designer,19
7,"Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .",Industrial Designer,19
7,And why not wood ?,Project Manager,20
7,"And ,",Industrial Designer,21
7,And why not wood ?,Project Manager,22
7,{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Project Manager,22
7,hmm ?,Industrial Designer,23
7,"{vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood .",Industrial Designer,23
7,{vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to .,Industrial Designer,23
7,"Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .",Industrial Designer,23
7,"We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .",Industrial Designer,23
7,"I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .",Industrial Designer,23
7,So that's what I've got on design .,Industrial Designer,23
7,'S good .,Project Manager,24
7,"Um , can I do next ?",Marketing,25
7,'Cause I have to say something about the material,Marketing,25
7,Hmm .,Project Manager,26
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,27
7,Yeah .,User Interface,28
7,which is quite shocking .,Marketing,29
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,30
7,Ha .,Marketing,31
7,Mm .,Marketing,31
7,"Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel .",Marketing,31
7,Um .,Marketing,31
7,Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that .,Marketing,31
7,And th last thing is the easy to use um factor .,Marketing,31
7,"Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use .",Marketing,31
7,"Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the {vocalsound} is the current trend",Marketing,31
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,32
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,33
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,34
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,35
7,"and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is .",Marketing,36
7,Um .,Marketing,36
7,"For fashion , we go for fashion .",Marketing,36
7,Mm .,Project Manager,37
7,The fashion in electronics .,Marketing,38
7,"So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables .",Marketing,38
7,"And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer .",Marketing,38
7,"As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go .",Marketing,38
7,Um .,Marketing,38
7,"I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,",Marketing,38
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,39
7,but that's just a personal opinion .,Marketing,40
7,{vocalsound},User Interface,41
7,I think,Marketing,42
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,43
7,I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .,Marketing,44
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,45
7,"{vocalsound} Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?",Marketing,46
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,47
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,48
7,"Um , and finally again with the spongy .",Marketing,49
7,It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine .,Marketing,49
7,"Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .",Marketing,49
7,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,50
7,Thank you for your attention .,Marketing,51
7,So .,User Interface,52
7,"I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah .",Project Manager,53
7,"Oh , uh , there we go .",User Interface,54
7,{vocalsound} Uh .,User Interface,54
7,Okay .,User Interface,54
7,Um .,User Interface,54
7,Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .,User Interface,54
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,55
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,56
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,57
7,{vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics,User Interface,58
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,59
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,60
7,and and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,61
7,Neither was I .,Marketing,62
7,"Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um {vocalsound} fabrics .",Marketing,62
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,62
7,Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control .,Project Manager,63
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,63
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,64
7,"So so okay , let me get this right .",User Interface,65
7,"Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway .",User Interface,65
7,Um {vocalsound} here we go .,User Interface,65
7,Conceptual User Interface .,User Interface,65
7,"Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .",User Interface,65
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,66
7,"And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system .",User Interface,67
7,"{vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen .",User Interface,67
7,"Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?",User Interface,67
7,Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .,Project Manager,68
7,'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel,User Interface,69
7,You need a screen for it ?,Project Manager,70
7,you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen .,User Interface,71
7,"You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever .",Industrial Designer,72
7,"With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three .",Industrial Designer,72
7,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,72
7,But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay .,User Interface,73
7,"So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?",User Interface,73
7,"We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,",Project Manager,74
7,Are we {disfmarker},User Interface,75
7,that was one of th I I was {disfmarker},Project Manager,76
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,77
7,Okay .,User Interface,78
7,"sorry ,",Project Manager,79
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,80
7,I I meant to update you on that .,Project Manager,81
7,Um .,Project Manager,81
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,82
7,{vocalsound} Alright .,User Interface,83
7,Okay .,User Interface,83
7,"But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said .",Marketing,84
7,Okay .,User Interface,85
7,Okay .,User Interface,85
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,86
7,That correct ?,Marketing,87
7,So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay .,User Interface,88
7,So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ?,User Interface,88
7,And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right .,User Interface,88
7,Graphical interface ?,Marketing,89
7,Yeah like you're g,User Interface,90
7,Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though .,Marketing,91
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,92
7,"yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can {disfmarker} okay we're not choosing that , I guess .",User Interface,93
7,"But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .",User Interface,93
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,94
7,So that {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} people seems to be {disfmarker} well {disfmarker},User Interface,95
7,"You've {disfmarker} Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to {disfmarker}",Project Manager,96
7,You know .,User Interface,97
7,But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels .,User Interface,97
7,So um {vocalsound} I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because {disfmarker} So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if {disfmarker} or or {disfmarker} then again if you just {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .,User Interface,97
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,98
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,99
7,You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or {disfmarker},User Interface,100
7,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing,101
7,But but imagine someone with s,Project Manager,102
7,"My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,103
7,I oh yeah ?,User Interface,104
7,But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels .,Project Manager,105
7,Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager,105
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,106
7,'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker},User Interface,107
7,Yeah .,Marketing,108
7,They have to r wheel really fast .,Industrial Designer,109
7,but you can quickly s you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,110
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,111
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,111
7,"But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,",Industrial Designer,112
7,Yeah .,User Interface,113
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,114
7,at least on theirs .,Industrial Designer,115
7,"Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different",User Interface,116
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,117
7,"uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels .",User Interface,118
7,Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth,User Interface,118
7,Right .,Project Manager,119
7,"And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,",User Interface,120
7,"Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better ,",Project Manager,121
7,like {disfmarker},User Interface,122
7,"because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,123
7,"I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker}",User Interface,124
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,125
7,"but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker}",User Interface,126
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,127
7,It's more expensive according to the design people .,Industrial Designer,128
7,m yeah .,User Interface,129
7,Uh .,Project Manager,130
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,130
7,"Yeah , that's the only thing though .",User Interface,131
7,"You have to get a {disfmarker} an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .",Industrial Designer,132
7,Yeah .,User Interface,133
7,"So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um {disfmarker}",User Interface,133
7,Mm .,Project Manager,134
7,"{vocalsound} You can get to {disfmarker} you know , you can {disfmarker} Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can {disfmarker} it brings up like the menu on the T_V_",User Interface,135
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,136
7,Mm .,Project Manager,137
7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,138
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,139
7,"and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the {disfmarker}",User Interface,140
7,Yeah .,Marketing,141
7,"So the T_V_ is the screen , that {disfmarker} yeah",Project Manager,142
7,"yeah , yeah .",User Interface,143
7,So it would have all these different options of changing,Project Manager,144
7,Yeah .,User Interface,145
7,But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .,User Interface,145
7,to {disfmarker},Project Manager,146
7,Look it even has settings .,Marketing,147
7,Okay .,Project Manager,148
7,Hmm ?,User Interface,149
7,On the {disfmarker},Marketing,150
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,151
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,152
7,{vocalsound} you can just take theirs and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing,153
7,"Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,",User Interface,154
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,155
7,"but um {disfmarker} 'cause that just {disfmarker} it does seem like , it {disfmarker} that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but {disfmarker} I dunno , and then {disfmarker} so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .",User Interface,156
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,157
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface,158
7,"Um , right .",Project Manager,159
7,"What if {disfmarker} I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes ,",Project Manager,159
7,Yeah .,User Interface,160
7,"um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing ,",Project Manager,161
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,162
7,or whatever we're thinking .,Project Manager,163
7,I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ?,Project Manager,163
7,Or {disfmarker},Project Manager,163
7,It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .,User Interface,164
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,165
7,So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before .,Project Manager,165
7,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager,165
7,Yeah .,User Interface,166
7,Yeah definitely .,User Interface,166
7,okay .,Project Manager,167
7,"Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .",User Interface,168
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,169
7,I mean it it needs to be easy to {disfmarker},User Interface,170
7,Yeah but should be comfortable .,Marketing,171
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,172
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,173
7,somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your {disfmarker},User Interface,174
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,175
7,"I mean how do how do {disfmarker} I'm not really {disfmarker} Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it .",User Interface,176
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface,176
7,"Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .",Project Manager,177
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,178
7,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,179
7,Or your thumb or something .,User Interface,179
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface,179
7,Yeah I use it like that .,Marketing,180
7,"W when we had the wheely remote control , we {disfmarker} it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .",Industrial Designer,181
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,182
7,Yeah .,User Interface,183
7,Yeah .,Marketing,184
7,"But , were there buttons on there as well ?",Project Manager,185
7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,186
7,Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .,Industrial Designer,187
7,Mm .,Project Manager,188
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,188
7,So we just used the top part .,Industrial Designer,189
7,Mm yeah .,User Interface,190
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,191
7,"Yeah , so {disfmarker} but I mean I think it could be pretty small .",User Interface,192
7,Uh .,Marketing,193
7,"Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can {disfmarker}",User Interface,194
7,"What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ?",Project Manager,195
7,Like you {disfmarker} so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ?,Project Manager,195
7,So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .,Project Manager,195
7,But can't you just get {disfmarker},User Interface,196
7,Do {disfmarker} do you know what I'm talking about though ?,Project Manager,197
7,"Like , uh , yeah just something {disfmarker}",Project Manager,197
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,198
7,Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,198
7,K,User Interface,199
7,"Well you can have it on the settings ,",Marketing,200
7,"Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,201
7,no ?,Marketing,202
7,"Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ?",User Interface,203
7,"If if you can get to , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen .",User Interface,203
7,Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing,Project Manager,204
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,205
7,is is {disfmarker} if w I {disfmarker},Project Manager,206
7,That keeps it,User Interface,207
7,"if we can do this , that'd probably be {disfmarker}",Project Manager,208
7,really {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface,209
7,Uh you wouldn't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I just don't think you would even need it .,User Interface,209
7,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,210
7,So {disfmarker},User Interface,211
7,"So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this {disfmarker} how they actually programme these things , and if that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,212
7,Mean {disfmarker},User Interface,213
7,Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?,Industrial Designer,214
7,yeah .,Project Manager,215
7,I mean it {disfmarker} would y would {disfmarker} that would be {disfmarker},Project Manager,215
7,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,216
7,"I mean you can do it ,",User Interface,217
7,They already do it .,Marketing,218
7,"I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .",Industrial Designer,219
7,you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it doesn't seem that hard .,User Interface,220
7,I mean I've never bought a remote .,User Interface,220
7,I'm not sure .,Industrial Designer,221
7,"It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,",User Interface,222
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,223
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,224
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,225
7,Well they usually are .,Industrial Designer,226
7,which is a little {disfmarker},User Interface,227
7,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,228
7,"My {disfmarker} I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .",User Interface,229
7,No .,Marketing,230
7,Huh .,Project Manager,231
7,But um {disfmarker},User Interface,232
7,I guess that's right .,Industrial Designer,233
7,It always comes with the T_V_ .,Industrial Designer,233
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,233
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,234
7,"So , um {disfmarker} but I mean it's {disfmarker} I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know .",User Interface,235
7,And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .,User Interface,235
7,"Yeah , it {disfmarker} most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something .",Industrial Designer,236
7,'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .,Industrial Designer,236
7,Yeah .,User Interface,237
7,Yeah .,User Interface,237
7,"Well so {disfmarker} So , do we need {disfmarker} I dunno .",User Interface,237
7,Well I guess we have to you know think about {disfmarker} But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .,User Interface,237
7,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,238
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,239
7,Okay .,Project Manager,239
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,240
7,That's what it does anyway .,User Interface,241
7,"But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you {disfmarker} like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,",Marketing,242
7,Yeah .,User Interface,243
7,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,244
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,245
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,245
7,"you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like {disfmarker}",Project Manager,246
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,247
7,and I never get it .,Marketing,248
7,yeah .,Project Manager,249
7,Yeah .,User Interface,250
7,Never ever .,Marketing,251
7,"So , but {disfmarker}",User Interface,252
7,So {disfmarker},Marketing,253
7,"oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?",User Interface,254
7,Well on the telly .,Marketing,255
7,Or on the T_V_ too .,Industrial Designer,256
7,"On the telly , okay , yeah .",User Interface,257
7,"So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea",User Interface,257
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,258
7,"because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .",User Interface,259
7,Mm .,Project Manager,260
7,"And it is technologically innovative in a way ,",Project Manager,260
7,Mm .,Marketing,261
7,so that fits with the {disfmarker},Project Manager,262
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,263
7,Yeah .,User Interface,264
7,I guess .,User Interface,264
7,"And it is trendy , the iPods are {vocalsound} really hot right now , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,264
7,B Yeah .,Project Manager,265
7,Did you did you get that pc picture on {disfmarker} did they provide you with that picture on the web ?,Marketing,266
7,"Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,267
7,That's quite interesting .,Marketing,268
7,What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ?,Marketing,268
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,268
7,Oh god .,Project Manager,269
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,269
7,"{vocalsound} Oh , I was gonna say .",Industrial Designer,270
7,Oh .,User Interface,271
7,You said uh people want spongy .,Industrial Designer,272
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,273
7,"{vocalsound} Um , one of your {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,274
7,Yeah .,User Interface,275
7,Yeah .,Marketing,276
7,one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's {gap} in like those stress ball things .,Industrial Designer,277
7,"So , that would be spongy .",Industrial Designer,277
7,"Oh , okay , that would be cool .",User Interface,278
7,Ah .,Project Manager,279
7,Yeah .,Marketing,280
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,281
7,Yeah .,Marketing,282
7,Mm .,User Interface,283
7,{vocalsound},User Interface,283
7,"Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .",Marketing,284
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,285
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,286
7,"Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of {disfmarker} oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing .",User Interface,287
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,288
7,I mean definitely the area round it .,Project Manager,288
7,But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda {disfmarker},User Interface,289
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,290
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager,291
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,292
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,293
7,so you're like {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,294
7,Yeah I think it could work .,Industrial Designer,295
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,296
7,Or what if we integrated the {vocalsound} the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables,User Interface,297
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,298
7,"we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like",User Interface,299
7,{vocalsound} Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .,Industrial Designer,300
7,a vegetable .,User Interface,301
7,{vocalsound},User Interface,301
7,Well it could be like mobiles that just {disfmarker} you just put a cover .,Marketing,302
7,An orange .,Project Manager,303
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager,303
7,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,304
7,"If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana ,",Marketing,305
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,306
7,"which frankly I'm not particularly fond of ,",Marketing,307
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,308
7,{vocalsound},User Interface,309
7,um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing .,Marketing,310
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,311
7,Yeah .,User Interface,312
7,You know you had {disfmarker} there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .,Marketing,313
7,"You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .",Industrial Designer,314
7,Yeah .,User Interface,315
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,316
7,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,317
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,318
7,Yeah .,User Interface,319
7,"You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or {disfmarker}",User Interface,319
7,Yeah .,Marketing,320
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,321
7,"And it could {disfmarker} the colour can fit your sitting room ,",Marketing,322
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,323
7,"so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have {disfmarker} well I don't know .",Marketing,324
7,Um .,Marketing,324
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,325
7,Yeah .,User Interface,326
7,So what if {disfmarker} what,Project Manager,327
7,So I think {disfmarker},User Interface,328
7,{disfmarker} this is {disfmarker},Project Manager,329
7,"yeah , colours .",User Interface,330
7,I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking .,Project Manager,331
7,"If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .",Project Manager,331
7,Yeah .,Marketing,332
7,Yeah .,User Interface,333
7,And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .,Project Manager,334
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,335
7,Is that kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,336
7,Yeah .,User Interface,337
7,I {disfmarker} 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours .,Project Manager,338
7,Yeah .,User Interface,339
7,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,340
7,Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables .,User Interface,341
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,342
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,343
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,344
7,I do I dunno .,User Interface,345
7,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,345
7,I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just {disfmarker} the feedback we've just got about the {disfmarker},Project Manager,346
7,Maybe a ball .,Marketing,347
7,A ball ?,Project Manager,348
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,349
7,"Know , a squashy ball .",Marketing,350
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,351
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,352
7,{vocalsound} A relaxing squashy ball .,Marketing,353
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} That you can p,Marketing,353
7,"That's in the shape of a fruit , like a {disfmarker}",User Interface,354
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,355
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,356
7,"well I {disfmarker} see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit",Marketing,357
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,358
7,and I'm thinking how do you change the hard {disfmarker} would you put a um sticker sort of ?,Marketing,359
7,"Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a {disfmarker}",Marketing,359
7,This is just {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,360
7,Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit .,Project Manager,360
7,Squashy .,Project Manager,360
7,"Oh , okay , yeah .",Marketing,361
7,Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing,361
7,That {disfmarker} see I was thinking this s,Project Manager,362
7,Which is cheaper .,Marketing,363
7,sorry {disfmarker},Project Manager,364
7,Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .,Marketing,365
7,I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .,Project Manager,366
7,Oh .,Industrial Designer,367
7,Mm .,Industrial Designer,367
7,Yeah .,User Interface,368
7,And like this {disfmarker} you could have like you could have like cherries and {vocalsound} things around there .,Project Manager,369
7,Oh I like that shape .,User Interface,370
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,371
7,Yeah .,User Interface,372
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,373
7,Um but {disfmarker},Project Manager,374
7,I was thinking sort of a single ball shape .,Industrial Designer,375
7,I was thinking if it was like this {disfmarker},Project Manager,376
7,{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface,377
7,So you're holding a squishy ball,Industrial Designer,378
7,'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy {disfmarker},Project Manager,379
7,and then it has a {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,380
7,It's like it has to be s,User Interface,381
7,"It's almost like your thumb is farther up ,",Project Manager,382
7,yeah {vocalsound} .,User Interface,383
7,so if if you could squish it lower then {disfmarker},Project Manager,384
7,Yeah I guess so .,Industrial Designer,385
7,Yeah .,User Interface,386
7,Yeah .,Marketing,387
7,So it wouldn't be very big in either {disfmarker} like how big ?,Marketing,387
7,"This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .",Marketing,387
7,"Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .",Project Manager,388
7,"What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can {disfmarker} so so maybe one you know {disfmarker} you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing {vocalsound}",User Interface,389
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,390
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,391
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,392
7,"and you could get {disfmarker} you could have your choice , you know ?",User Interface,393
7,"Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover .",Marketing,394
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,395
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,396
7,"But {disfmarker} well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that ,",Marketing,397
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,398
7,Yeah .,User Interface,399
7,"and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that ,",Marketing,400
7,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,401
7,Mm .,Project Manager,402
7,"and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is ,",Marketing,403
7,Yeah .,User Interface,404
7,Okay .,Project Manager,405
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,406
7,and {disfmarker},Marketing,407
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,408
7,Yeah .,User Interface,409
7,Okay .,Project Manager,410
7,No .,Marketing,411
7,Oh .,User Interface,412
7,Um .,Marketing,413
7,That's nicer .,Marketing,413
7,I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .,Marketing,413
7,Yeah .,User Interface,414
7,Hmm .,Project Manager,415
7,"Well that's not very neat , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}",Project Manager,415
7,Um .,Marketing,416
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,417
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,418
7,Yeah .,User Interface,419
7,I mean I think uh {disfmarker} and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely {disfmarker} So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .,User Interface,419
7,"If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your {disfmarker} to the way you hold it .",Marketing,420
7,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,421
7,Yeah you could squish it .,Industrial Designer,422
7,"If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you {disfmarker} it it just moulds to your hand .",Marketing,423
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,424
7,Yeah .,User Interface,425
7,So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?,User Interface,425
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,426
7,"I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .",Industrial Designer,427
7,Fruits and veg .,User Interface,428
7,We we don't know .,Marketing,429
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,429
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,430
7,Yeah .,User Interface,431
7,Yeah .,Marketing,432
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,433
7,Yeah .,User Interface,434
7,And the rest is the company {disfmarker} the company colour's silver ?,Marketing,435
7,"It was , yeah , silver and yellow .",Project Manager,436
7,It l it looks like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker},Project Manager,436
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,437
7,We could promote the banana one .,User Interface,438
7,Okay .,Marketing,439
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,440
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,440
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,441
7,{vocalsound} Like {disfmarker} mm .,User Interface,442
7,"I mean that's another question , where are we gonna {disfmarker} we we should have the logo somewhere on it .",Project Manager,443
7,Mm .,User Interface,444
7,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,445
7,"Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't {disfmarker}",Marketing,445
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,446
7,I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .,Industrial Designer,447
7,Oh yeah .,User Interface,448
7,"Yeah , th and that would {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}",Project Manager,449
7,Yeah .,User Interface,450
7,Okay .,Marketing,451
7,Especially if you're switching out the squishy part .,Industrial Designer,452
7,Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .,Industrial Designer,452
7,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,453
7,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,454
7,"Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit .",User Interface,455
7,"The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .",User Interface,455
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,456
7,But uh it {disfmarker},User Interface,457
7,Well I dunno .,Industrial Designer,458
7,You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand .,Industrial Designer,458
7,Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .,Industrial Designer,458
7,Yeah .,User Interface,459
7,No but it does it automatically .,Marketing,460
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,461
7,{vocalsound},User Interface,462
7,{vocalsound} Does it automatically ?,Marketing,463
7,Yeah .,User Interface,464
7,I don't know .,Marketing,465
7,I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .,Project Manager,466
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,467
7,{vocalsound} But if someone {disfmarker},Project Manager,468
7,Okay .,Marketing,469
7,components concept .,Project Manager,470
7,Question mark .,Project Manager,470
7,Energy .,Project Manager,470
7,Question mark .,Project Manager,470
7,That was me .,Industrial Designer,471
7,Was that you ?,Project Manager,472
7,Yes .,Industrial Designer,473
7,Okay .,Project Manager,474
7,Oh right right .,Project Manager,474
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,474
7,"Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ?",Project Manager,474
7,I mean we're gonna use batteries right ?,Project Manager,474
7,And {disfmarker},Project Manager,474
7,"Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,",Industrial Designer,475
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,476
7,which is something I don't know what it is .,Industrial Designer,477
7,Something to do with torches .,Industrial Designer,477
7,"Oh , a dynamo is {disfmarker} ah , {vocalsound} it's a bicycle .",Marketing,478
7,It's a bicycle mechanism .,Marketing,478
7,"It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .",Marketing,478
7,Oh okay .,Industrial Designer,479
7,"Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself .",Industrial Designer,479
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,480
7,So I sort of picked battery .,Industrial Designer,481
7,{vocalsound},User Interface,482
7,It's quite sweet .,Marketing,483
7,We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power .,Industrial Designer,484
7,Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .,Industrial Designer,484
7,I think batteries sound good .,Project Manager,485
7,It {vocalsound} it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .,Industrial Designer,486
7,What does everyone else think ?,Project Manager,487
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,487
7,{vocalsound} The dynamo would be interesting {vocalsound} .,User Interface,488
7,No .,Marketing,489
7,"But dynamo {disfmarker} the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it {vocalsound} creates energy on its own .",Marketing,489
7,What about Kryptonite ?,Project Manager,490
7,{vocalsound},Project Manager,490
7,Oh .,User Interface,491
7,Which is quite cool .,Marketing,492
7,"So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying .",Marketing,492
7,But we need to find cost .,Marketing,492
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,493
7,Don't know the cost .,Marketing,494
7,Didn't have enough data to actually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,495
7,Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?,Marketing,496
7,"All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things .",Industrial Designer,497
7,It didn't give me any actual cost .,Industrial Designer,497
7,Okay .,Marketing,498
7,Right .,Marketing,498
7,Hmm .,User Interface,499
7,Mm .,Marketing,500
7,Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk .,Industrial Designer,501
7,So I don't think it's that much of a problem .,Industrial Designer,501
7,Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .,Industrial Designer,501
7,What does chip on print mean ?,Project Manager,502
7,"Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,",Industrial Designer,503
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,504
7,Uh-huh .,Project Manager,505
7,calculators too I think .,Industrial Designer,506
7,"Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .",Industrial Designer,506
7,Okay .,Project Manager,507
7,"But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .",Industrial Designer,508
7,Right .,Project Manager,509
7,"So , chip on print is just {disfmarker} means like that they're mass-produced .",Project Manager,509
7,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,510
7,Okay .,Project Manager,511
7,And case ?,Project Manager,511
7,"Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about ,",Project Manager,511
7,Case is what we were discussing yeah .,Industrial Designer,512
7,yeah .,Project Manager,513
7,Casing .,Project Manager,513
7,Yeah .,Project Manager,513
7,{gap} thinking of like syntactic case and thi,Project Manager,513
7,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,514
7,um {vocalsound} let's see .,Project Manager,515
7,Is there anything else we need to,Project Manager,515
7,Hmm .,User Interface,516
7,talk about ?,Project Manager,517
7,"Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .",Project Manager,517
7,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,518
7,"Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design .",Project Manager,519
7,And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation .,Project Manager,519
7,So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .,Project Manager,519
7,"Oh , thank you .",Marketing,520
7,{vocalsound},Marketing,520
7,Mm .,Project Manager,521
7,Cool .,User Interface,522
7,See you soon .,Project Manager,523
7,Does it matter that I end early ?,Project Manager,523
7,I {disfmarker} it's strange because {disfmarker},Marketing,524
7,How how early is it ?,Project Manager,525
7,I didn't get a pop-up thing that said {disfmarker},Project Manager,525
8,Oh .,Project Manager,1
8,It's not saved yet .,User Interface,2
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,3
8,So {disfmarker},User Interface,4
8,Okay .,Project Manager,5
8,Our beautiful drawing .,User Interface,6
8,So just f um {disfmarker} So this is our agenda .,Project Manager,7
8,You're {disfmarker} F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .,Project Manager,7
8,Oops .,Marketing,8
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,9
8,Uh I didn't {disfmarker} Oh yeah .,Project Manager,10
8,So these are the {disfmarker},Project Manager,10
8,"Oh , okay .",Industrial Designer,11
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,11
8,So these are the um last notes we I made .,Project Manager,12
8,"If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then .",Project Manager,12
8,I don't have to put it in the report .,Project Manager,12
8,Are we doing the the speech recognition ?,User Interface,13
8,Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .,User Interface,13
8,"Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially .",Project Manager,14
8,"So if you want to , it's okay .",Project Manager,14
8,Okay yeah .,User Interface,15
8,Well then then we're gonna put it in .,User Interface,15
8,"Okay , just {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker}",Project Manager,16
8,"Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,17
8,"Yeah , and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ?",Industrial Designer,18
8,Or fold open ?,Industrial Designer,18
8,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,18
8,Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .,Project Manager,19
8,It's probably better .,Industrial Designer,20
8,"Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you {gap} other functions .",Industrial Designer,20
8,{vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .,User Interface,21
8,Maybe that's better .,Project Manager,22
8,"Yeah , that's that's a very good point .",Project Manager,22
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,23
8,"Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside .",User Interface,24
8,Think that's better .,Industrial Designer,25
8,So you can make it very easy to use .,User Interface,26
8,'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .,User Interface,26
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,27
8,Okay .,Project Manager,27
8,So this is okay ?,Project Manager,27
8,{gap},Project Manager,27
8,{gap} No .,User Interface,28
8,"Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .",User Interface,28
8,"Okay , so that's {disfmarker} Uh I'll just have a look how much that is .",Project Manager,29
8,{vocalsound} The {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,30
8,"But um {disfmarker} Okay , for the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,31
8,Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .,User Interface,32
8,Okay .,Project Manager,33
8,"Yeah , I I think so .",Industrial Designer,34
8,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,34
8,"No , you have a different chip for speech recognition .",Project Manager,35
8,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,35
8,Okay .,User Interface,36
8,Ah okay .,Industrial Designer,37
8,So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget .,Project Manager,38
8,So it's okay .,Project Manager,38
8,Good .,User Interface,39
8,So you can show your prototype if you want to .,Project Manager,40
8,Together ?,User Interface,41
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,42
8,"Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Let's do it together .",Industrial Designer,42
8,I'll give comments .,User Interface,43
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,44
8,"Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements .",Industrial Designer,44
8,Uh the look-and-feel model .,Industrial Designer,44
8,"Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there .",Industrial Designer,44
8,Simply a square with uh round corners .,Industrial Designer,44
8,So that's basically it .,Industrial Designer,44
8,{vocalsound} Uh the material should be hard plastic .,Industrial Designer,44
8,"Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .",Industrial Designer,44
8,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,45
8,"And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,46
8,Um then the elements .,Industrial Designer,46
8,Uh we have {disfmarker} The functions are just basic .,Industrial Designer,46
8,Like uh I've pointed them here .,Industrial Designer,46
8,"Mute function , on-off function , text functions .",Industrial Designer,46
8,This uh switch channel .,Industrial Designer,46
8,"Okay , cool .",Project Manager,47
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,47
8,And this is the the num-pad .,Industrial Designer,48
8,"And the logo is over here , and the mic .",Industrial Designer,48
8,Okay .,Project Manager,49
8,"And the scrollwheel , no ?",Industrial Designer,50
8,You operate that with your pointing finger .,Industrial Designer,50
8,Means {disfmarker},Marketing,51
8,So you hold it like this in your right hand and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,52
8,Mm .,Project Manager,53
8,So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?,Project Manager,53
8,{vocalsound},Marketing,54
8,Speech recognition .,User Interface,55
8,"Yeah , speech recognition .",Project Manager,56
8,Just {disfmarker} Only one button to say it's on or off .,Project Manager,56
8,Um I didn't have a specification of that .,User Interface,57
8,But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .,User Interface,57
8,Uh I dunno .,Industrial Designer,58
8,Um so I've {disfmarker},User Interface,59
8,"Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .",Industrial Designer,60
8,"Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .",User Interface,61
8,So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .,Project Manager,62
8,"Yeah , you can {gap} put 'em all on the back .",User Interface,63
8,That's for sure .,User Interface,63
8,"Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,64
8,Okay .,Project Manager,65
8,That's uh {disfmarker},User Interface,66
8,"Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .",Industrial Designer,67
8,Okay .,Marketing,68
8,"We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons .",User Interface,69
8,But {disfmarker} You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .,User Interface,69
8,"Yeah , you can put it separate .",Project Manager,70
8,You {disfmarker} Yeah I know .,User Interface,71
8,I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something .,User Interface,71
8,So {disfmarker} But it's enough room .,User Interface,71
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,72
8,Um the position ?,Industrial Designer,72
8,"Yeah , you write uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,72
8,Uh well {disfmarker},User Interface,73
8,"You wrote this , so .",Industrial Designer,74
8,"Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central .",User Interface,75
8,That was the the most important thing .,User Interface,75
8,{gap},Marketing,76
8,"So uh the best {gap} place , the best reach place {disfmarker} Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .",User Interface,77
8,"Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out .",User Interface,77
8,"That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up .",User Interface,77
8,Uh scrollwheel is on the left side .,User Interface,77
8,"It's {vocalsound} basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .",User Interface,77
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,78
8,"But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed .",Industrial Designer,78
8,So y Because you can use your thumb then .,Industrial Designer,78
8,Yeah .,User Interface,79
8,Just just one thing now .,Marketing,80
8,Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine .,Marketing,80
8,"Okay yeah , they {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface,81
8,But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .,Marketing,82
8,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer,83
8,Yeah okay .,User Interface,84
8,That's that's below that then .,User Interface,84
8,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,85
8,It's uh twelve buttons .,User Interface,86
8,{gap} just so you get that .,Industrial Designer,87
8,"Okay , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's rather important .",Marketing,88
8,{vocalsound},Marketing,88
8,"Yeah okay , just we just missed that .",User Interface,89
8,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,90
8,But um I'll just uh {disfmarker} I'll get back to later .,User Interface,91
8,"F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device .",User Interface,91
8,So um should be popular .,User Interface,91
8,Um {disfmarker} The f uh the buttons creating ?,User Interface,91
8,"Uh if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .",User Interface,91
8,Okay .,Project Manager,92
8,"So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling .",User Interface,93
8,Um we'll use hard plastic .,User Interface,93
8,"Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .",User Interface,93
8,Colour changeable .,User Interface,93
8,"Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up .",User Interface,93
8,"We have decided uh {vocalsound} in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .",User Interface,93
8,Okay .,Marketing,94
8,"And also in the num-pads , there's also colour {gap} light behind it .",User Interface,95
8,"And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?",Project Manager,96
8,So when you pre Yeah .,User Interface,97
8,How do you want to implement that ?,Project Manager,98
8,Just on the {disfmarker} Maybe on the second level as well ?,Project Manager,98
8,We're going to implement .,User Interface,99
8,Yeah .,User Interface,99
8,Mm just a little {disfmarker},User Interface,99
8,"Yeah , these are just basic functions , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,100
8,Ah .,Marketing,101
8,All the non-basic are in {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,102
8,"Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .",Project Manager,103
8,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,104
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,105
8,Um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,105
8,"Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions .",Marketing,106
8,It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart .,Marketing,106
8,Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player .,Marketing,106
8,"Okay , maybe we use this button for the {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,107
8,"That function must be {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .",Marketing,108
8,"Yeah ,",User Interface,109
8,"Yeah , as well .",Project Manager,110
8,I um {disfmarker},User Interface,111
8,Just make make a {gap} {disfmarker},Project Manager,112
8,To your video device .,User Interface,113
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,114
8,Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .,Project Manager,115
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,115
8,Yeah .,User Interface,116
8,{vocalsound},User Interface,116
8,{vocalsound} A second level ?,Industrial Designer,117
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,118
8,Like a a new blank one or {disfmarker} Or just here ?,Industrial Designer,119
8,"No no , just on {disfmarker} Down there .",Project Manager,120
8,Is i Ah okay .,User Interface,121
8,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,122
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,123
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,123
8,And h how does the second level come out ?,Marketing,124
8,Just uh if you s,Project Manager,125
8,Uh it slides uh along ?,Marketing,126
8,Um slides I think .,User Interface,127
8,"Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .",Project Manager,128
8,It's,User Interface,129
8,From from the uh beneath ?,Marketing,130
8,For the bottom .,Project Manager,131
8,"You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .",User Interface,132
8,"No , you gotta slide it .",Project Manager,133
8,If that breaks then you're screwed .,User Interface,134
8,"Yeah , it's right .",Project Manager,135
8,So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open .,User Interface,136
8,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,136
8,So what do we need ?,Industrial Designer,137
8,Uh i the the speech functions buttons .,User Interface,138
8,"Yeah , just {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,139
8,Menu ?,Marketing,140
8,Menu button .,User Interface,141
8,With uh maybe uh arrows .,User Interface,141
8,So you can uh,User Interface,141
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,142
8,"scroll in the , navigate the menu .",User Interface,143
8,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,143
8,God damn it .,Industrial Designer,144
8,Scart ?,Marketing,145
8,{gap} I think we can even put a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels .,User Interface,146
8,Uh yeah .,Marketing,147
8,"And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left .",Marketing,147
8,Yes .,Marketing,147
8,{vocalsound},Marketing,147
8,"So you have one left for the {disfmarker} Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera .",User Interface,148
8,That's used pretty often .,User Interface,148
8,So this is the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,149
8,Yeah .,Marketing,150
8,"If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .",User Interface,151
8,{gap},Industrial Designer,152
8,{vocalsound} It's a f {vocalsound} basic uh {disfmarker},Marketing,153
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,154
8,Extern or something .,Industrial Designer,155
8,{gap},User Interface,156
8,You want to save that file as well ?,Project Manager,157
8,The drawing ?,Project Manager,157
8,That was it .,User Interface,158
8,"So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .",Industrial Designer,159
8,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,160
8,Doesn't really matter .,Project Manager,161
8,Just just uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,161
8,It doesn't really matter .,User Interface,162
8,I don't know the functions .,Industrial Designer,163
8,That's {disfmarker} Yeah well we don't have any uh {disfmarker},User Interface,164
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,165
8,What else ?,Industrial Designer,165
8,Hmm ?,User Interface,166
8,What else ?,Industrial Designer,167
8,What else ?,User Interface,168
8,Uh menu buttons with arrows .,User Interface,168
8,Uh menu .,Industrial Designer,169
8,"Yeah , to navigate .",Marketing,170
8,S Just uh like {disfmarker},User Interface,171
8,Uh {gap} With arrows .,Industrial Designer,172
8,Um I think it's best if we do .,User Interface,173
8,Mm where do we have {disfmarker} Or there .,User Interface,173
8,Like a normal um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,174
8,Like on the normal uh {disfmarker} Like this .,User Interface,175
8,"Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button .",Industrial Designer,176
8,"The menu button , yes .",User Interface,177
8,{vocalsound},Marketing,178
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,179
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,180
8,"Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires .",User Interface,181
8,So you can't redesign it .,User Interface,181
8,{vocalsound} Mm okay .,Marketing,182
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,183
8,Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?,Marketing,184
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,185
8,Yep .,User Interface,186
8,"Uh and and you can hold it ,",Marketing,187
8,{gap},Project Manager,188
8,"you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .",Marketing,189
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,190
8,"Just press it once , the colour should uh switch .",User Interface,191
8,"Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?",User Interface,191
8,{gap} okay .,Marketing,192
8,"Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it .",Project Manager,193
8,"Just red , yel uh red , green and {disfmarker}",Project Manager,193
8,"Okay , yeah .",Marketing,194
8,Th Yeah .,Marketing,194

8,"If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .",Marketing,196
8,"That's that's very easy , yeah .",Project Manager,197
8,We can put those here .,Industrial Designer,198
8,Colour buttons .,Marketing,199
8,"And then we choose green , uh blue and red or",Marketing,199
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,200

8,Just make it {disfmarker},Project Manager,217
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,218
8,"Yeah , or th or the {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,218
8,There's one text button I prefer .,Marketing,219
8,"That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .",Marketing,219
8,"Yeah , we have that on the the text button .",User Interface,220
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,221
8,Do you do you {disfmarker},Marketing,222
8,Yep .,Industrial Designer,223
8,Did you think of that ?,Marketing,224
8,"Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext .",Industrial Designer,225
8,You just switch it off and then {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,225
8,Uh why not ?,User Interface,226
8,"Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .",Project Manager,227
8,Ex Yeah .,Marketing,228
8,Yeah .,Marketing,228
8,No {disfmarker} Whoa {disfmarker},User Interface,229
8,Well w we thought of a text button .,Industrial Designer,230
8,"And if you press it again , you get the the the",Industrial Designer,230
8,I think um {disfmarker},User Interface,231
8,The sta the state you {disfmarker},Marketing,232
8,"Oh just three stages , you {disfmarker}",Project Manager,233
8,through view .,Industrial Designer,234
8,"Yeah , that's okay .",Project Manager,235
8,"Yeah , the three stages .",User Interface,236
8,Yes .,User Interface,236
8,"Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off .",Industrial Designer,237
8,Yeah .,Marketing,238
8,So you can switch back from second to w first .,Industrial Designer,239
8,"No , it doesn't have to turn it off .",User Interface,240
8,Just don't {gap} {disfmarker},User Interface,240
8,No .,Marketing,241
8,Just remember where it was .,Marketing,241
8,Yeah .,User Interface,242
8,It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page .,Marketing,243
8,"If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?",Marketing,243
8,"Yes , that's to remember .",Project Manager,244
8,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer,245
8,"Yeah , but that's that's uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,246
8,But maybe it's not the way {disfmarker},Marketing,247
8,I dunno if {gap} {disfmarker},User Interface,248
8,That's a functionality for the television .,Project Manager,249
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,249
8,"Yeah , I think as well , but {disfmarker} Uh yeah .",User Interface,250
8,Mm .,Marketing,251
8,That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .,Marketing,251
8,"Yeah mm nee uh {disfmarker} No , if i {vocalsound} uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television .",Industrial Designer,252
8,Th th th if you switch it on .,Industrial Designer,252
8,"Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the",User Interface,253
8,Okay .,Project Manager,254
8,"Yeah , but you have to search every time again .",Project Manager,254
8,the chip .,User Interface,255
8,Th i,Industrial Designer,256
8,That's what what happening if you do it like that .,Project Manager,257
8,But it's still the television that has to do that .,Project Manager,257
8,"Yeah , that's true .",User Interface,258
8,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,259
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,259
8,So yeah .,User Interface,260
8,Um do we need to fix that or {disfmarker},User Interface,260
8,"No , that's what the television does .",Project Manager,261
8,Mm {vocalsound} most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .,Marketing,262
8,"Yeah , those memory functions .",Industrial Designer,263
8,"But uh not not every every television , so {disfmarker}",Marketing,264
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,265
8,"Okay , it's cool .",Project Manager,266
8,Was uh this logo for uh volume ?,Industrial Designer,267
8,"Yeah , that's fine .",Project Manager,268
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,269
8,So that's it ?,Industrial Designer,269
8,"Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?",Project Manager,270
8,"Yeah , I I thought about one thing .",Marketing,271
8,Uh the buttons ?,Marketing,271
8,Uh from which material are they now ?,Marketing,271
8,Mm .,Industrial Designer,272
8,No no,Industrial Designer,272
8,"Just like your telephone , hard plastic .",User Interface,273
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,274
8,Just hard plastic .,Industrial Designer,274
8,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,274
8,Okay .,Marketing,275
8,It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .,Project Manager,276
8,"Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh {disfmarker} And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ?",Marketing,277
8,Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?,Marketing,277
8,I think just on the buttons .,User Interface,278
8,Uh I think just um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,279
8,"If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .",User Interface,280
8,Well yeah .,Marketing,281
8,That's too much place .,Marketing,281
8,I don't think the space is worth it .,User Interface,282
8,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,283
8,"Okay , just leave it .",Marketing,284
8,Just leave it .,Marketing,284
8,I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .,Industrial Designer,285

8,"Oh okay , you made some criteria .",Project Manager,289
8,"Okay , cool .",Project Manager,289
8,Okay .,Project Manager,289
8,I d d d I don't think if it's right .,Marketing,290

8,"We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our",Marketing,300
8,Okay .,Project Manager,301
8,um {vocalsound} model .,Marketing,302
8,Okay .,Project Manager,303
8,"And this {disfmarker} These are all I I I found , or I wrote down .",Marketing,304
8,"And um {vocalsound} we have to discuss about {vocalsound} , if we give it a one or a seven .",Marketing,304
8,Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea .,Project Manager,305
8,It quite beautiful .,Project Manager,305
8,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,306
8,It's {disfmarker},Project Manager,307
8,Yes .,Marketing,308
8,We are actu We are the {disfmarker},Project Manager,309
8,Mm .,User Interface,310
8,"Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something .",Marketing,311
8,And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and {vocalsound} and that kind of stuff .,Marketing,311
8,Flashy .,Project Manager,312
8,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface,313
8,Well I think we do {disfmarker},User Interface,313
8,The LEDs .,Marketing,314
8,"If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .",User Interface,315

8,But uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,317
8,And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ?,Marketing,318
8,Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .,Industrial Designer,319
8,Hmm ?,User Interface,320
8,The basic colours are black or green or yellow ?,Marketing,321
8,"Um basic colours ,",User Interface,322
8,Or you haven't thought about {disfmarker},Marketing,323
8,um yeah .,User Interface,324
8,Well you didn't say .,User Interface,324
8,Ho how do we make uh {disfmarker},Marketing,325
8,Maybe um company colours ?,User Interface,326
8,It's black .,Project Manager,327
8,Black .,User Interface,328
8,Black and yellow .,Marketing,329
8,"Yeah , yellow light .",Project Manager,330
8,A bit a bit of yellow .,User Interface,331
8,Can {disfmarker},Marketing,332
8,Do we have yellow light ?,Project Manager,333
8,"No , not really , but it's possible .",Project Manager,333
8,"Not not not yellow {gap} , but just a bit of light yellow .",User Interface,334
8,It's {disfmarker},Project Manager,335
8,"Black white , maybe ?",Marketing,336
8,"Like white , also ni or uh always nice .",User Interface,337
8,And what colours should the buttons be ?,Industrial Designer,338
8,Uh {disfmarker} Because um {disfmarker},Marketing,339
8,"Yeah , different colours .",Project Manager,340
8,This is {disfmarker},Project Manager,340
8,Just um {disfmarker},User Interface,341
8,"Oh , the same as th th the cover .",Project Manager,342
8,But also th the light behind it .,Project Manager,342
8,Yes .,User Interface,343
8,"But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?",Industrial Designer,344
8,"No , no .",Project Manager,345
8,"Make them {disfmarker} No , just make them black or grey or something .",Project Manager,345
8,"Yeah , grey .",User Interface,346
8,Just dark grey I think .,User Interface,346
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,347
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,348
8,"Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ?",Marketing,349
8,"Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .",Marketing,349
8,"Well we have changeable fronts , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,350
8,"Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .",Marketing,351
8,So {disfmarker},User Interface,352
8,"Yeah , just give it a one .",Project Manager,353
8,It's okay .,Project Manager,353
8,Yeah .,User Interface,354
8,It's perfect .,Project Manager,355
8,I think it's just what you want .,Project Manager,355
8,Or not ?,Project Manager,355
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,355
8,"It's hard to decide for us , but yeah .",User Interface,356
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,357
8,It's ju so subjective .,Industrial Designer,357
8,It it's {disfmarker} At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .,User Interface,358
8,"Okay , just give it a two .",Project Manager,359
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,359
8,Yeah .,Marketing,360
8,A two .,Marketing,360
8,Okay .,Marketing,360
8,The fancy look-and-feel .,Marketing,360
8,That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons .,Marketing,360
8,Yeah .,User Interface,361
8,Okay .,Marketing,362
8,"And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think .",Marketing,362
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,363
8,One more thing .,Industrial Designer,364
8,So {disfmarker},Marketing,365
8,Are w are we changing uh {disfmarker} Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ?,Industrial Designer,366
8,Or n no back light ?,Industrial Designer,366
8,Slide panel ?,Marketing,367
8,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,368
8,No .,Project Manager,369
8,"No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers",Project Manager,369
8,Mm .,User Interface,370
8,Not needed {gap} .,User Interface,370
8,and uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,371
8,"Yeah , not needed I think .",User Interface,372
8,And and the switch channel is uh {disfmarker} There is a back light too ?,Industrial Designer,373
8,"That as well , yeah .",Project Manager,374
8,"Oh , you mean th this here ?",Marketing,375
8,Yeah .,User Interface,376
8,"Yeah , but that's unnecessary .",Project Manager,377
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,378
8,What do I think is necessary necessary item ?,User Interface,379
8,It's pretty cool .,Marketing,380
8,"If you slide it open , {vocalsound} it lights up .",Marketing,380
8,"That's that's really fancy , but {vocalsound} I don't know if it's reachable .",Marketing,380
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,381
8,{vocalsound} Of course it's reachable .,User Interface,382
8,It doesn't make {disfmarker},Project Manager,383
8,Then we do it .,Marketing,384
8,{vocalsound},Marketing,384
8,"{vocalsound} Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up .",User Interface,385
8,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,386
8,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,386
8,So you can see what's really there .,User Interface,387
8,Not just not re on the buttons or something .,User Interface,387
8,No .,Project Manager,388
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,388
8,Just a green light or some blue light .,User Interface,389
8,To light it all up .,User Interface,389
8,"Yeah ,",Marketing,390
8,But {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,391
8,Mayb Okay .,Project Manager,391
8,but {disfmarker},Marketing,392
8,"Yeah , just backlight .",Industrial Designer,393
8,Not not the buttons .,Industrial Designer,393
8,Yeah .,User Interface,394
8,"And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons .",Industrial Designer,395
8,So the buttons are just grey .,Industrial Designer,395
8,Well yeah .,User Interface,396
8,Uh semi-transparent .,User Interface,396
8,Okay .,Marketing,397
8,"Yeah , just only {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,398
8,Okay .,Industrial Designer,399
8,"Okay , fine .",Marketing,400
8,So I I think it's very fancy .,Marketing,400
8,"So {disfmarker} Yeah , that's how I think .",Project Manager,401
8,"Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,402
8,So I'll give it a {disfmarker},Marketing,403
8,Ye,Project Manager,404
8,"Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so {disfmarker}",Marketing,405
8,"Yeah , this {disfmarker} It is a one .",Project Manager,406
8,Yeah .,User Interface,407
8,It's okay .,Project Manager,408
8,It's cool .,Project Manager,408
8,I think it's one .,Marketing,409
8,"Okay , next .",Marketing,409
8,"This is a difficult one , because we we don't {disfmarker} Yeah , we don't know it about the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,410
8,{vocalsound} Learnable ?,Marketing,411
8,Easy to use ?,Marketing,411
8,"Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,411
8,"Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .",Project Manager,412
8,Yeah .,User Interface,413
8,It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker},Project Manager,414
8,"No , but you don't have to use that .",Industrial Designer,415
8,Yeah .,Marketing,416
8,And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .,Industrial Designer,417
8,No .,Project Manager,418
8,That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .,Industrial Designer,419
8,"So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker}",User Interface,420
8,Learnable ?,Marketing,421
8,It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .,Marketing,421
8,"Well , I think it is .",Industrial Designer,422
8,"Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .",Marketing,423
8,Well y just uh f,User Interface,424
8,"I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or",Marketing,425
8,"But the rest of it is very easy ,",Project Manager,426
8,{disfmarker} Uh then the re,Marketing,427
8,because there are so so n,Project Manager,428
8,"Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .",User Interface,429
8,So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .,Industrial Designer,430
8,Yes .,User Interface,431
8,Yeah .,Marketing,432
8,"But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .",User Interface,433
8,Okay .,Marketing,434
8,So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .,Project Manager,435
8,Okay .,Marketing,436
8,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker},User Interface,437
8,But {disfmarker},Marketing,438
8,"And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .",Project Manager,439
8,Yeah .,Marketing,440
8,"But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?",Marketing,440
8,Device .,User Interface,441
8,And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls .,Marketing,442
8,"So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide .",Marketing,442
8,You must slide it .,Marketing,442
8,And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .,Marketing,442
8,But {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,443
8,'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use .,Marketing,444
8,Okay .,User Interface,445
8,Because easy to use comes after learnable .,Marketing,446
8,"Okay , just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool ,",Project Manager,447
8,I I think it a three or something .,Marketing,448
8,so just give it a two .,Project Manager,449
8,Maybe three then .,User Interface,450
8,Learnable's {disfmarker},User Interface,450
8,"No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .",Project Manager,451
8,Mm uh .,Industrial Designer,452
8,The normal .,Industrial Designer,452
8,Yeah okay .,User Interface,453
8,Yeah .,User Interface,453
8,{vocalsound} And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,454
8,"Yep , true .",User Interface,455
8,Then a two .,User Interface,455
8,Oh .,Marketing,456
8,Okay .,Marketing,456
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,457
8,Okay .,Project Manager,458
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,458
8,New features .,Marketing,459

8,"And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .",User Interface,462
8,The scrollwheel and the slide .,Marketing,463
8,Uh I think the slide is pretty new .,Marketing,463
8,Slide is not n is is not new .,Project Manager,464
8,No .,Project Manager,464
8,I already have a {disfmarker},Project Manager,464
8,"Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .",Marketing,465
8,Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight .,Project Manager,466
8,And they all have a slide in it .,Project Manager,466
8,Okay .,Marketing,467
8,So that's not new .,Project Manager,468
8,"But also slide that buttons come out , as well ?",User Interface,469
8,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,470
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,471
8,Okay .,User Interface,472
8,"Okay , and the the the lightning ?",Marketing,473
8,That's cool .,Project Manager,474
8,Is that new ?,Marketing,475
8,Yeah for a {disfmarker} Uh for a f,Project Manager,476

8,"Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .",Marketing,483
8,Yeah .,User Interface,484
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,485
8,So we have a pretty new uh {disfmarker},Marketing,486
8,"There are no games on it , that's that's {disfmarker} It's not a one , it's a two again .",Project Manager,487
8,That would {disfmarker} And we didn't uh {disfmarker},User Interface,488
8,It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .,Marketing,489
8,But then we also have the the home station .,User Interface,490

8,"Yeah , just draw it afterwards .",Project Manager,500
8,{gap},Project Manager,500
8,"Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .",Industrial Designer,501
8,I don't know .,User Interface,502
8,"If you {disfmarker} Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ?",Project Manager,503

8,So,Industrial Designer,541
8,Yeah .,Marketing,542
8,Yeah .,Marketing,542
8,think that's a two or a one .,Industrial Designer,543
8,Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh {disfmarker} {gap} That's {gap} that's {gap} {vocalsound} That's this question .,Marketing,544
8,"Yeah , but s it {disfmarker} That's basically not not handy .",Industrial Designer,545

8,Oh yeah .,Marketing,559
8,But spongy will never be .,Marketing,559
8,{vocalsound},Marketing,559

8,Yeah .,Project Manager,648
8,Or a different style .,Marketing,649
8,then there {vocalsound} we probably have been creative .,Industrial Designer,650
8,I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it .,User Interface,651
8,So {disfmarker},User Interface,651
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,652
8,Yeah .,Marketing,653
8,We could make a lot of different uh remote controls .,Marketing,653
8,Yeah .,Project Manager,654
8,{vocalsound},Project Manager,654
8,So it's creativity .,Marketing,655
8,Huh .,Industrial Designer,656

8,"If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .",User Interface,683
8,"Yeah , th that's weird .",Industrial Designer,684
8,"Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now .",Marketing,685
8,"Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would {gap} it .",User Interface,686
8,And then {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing,687

8,Hmm hmm yeah .,Industrial Designer,689
8,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,690
8,"Yeah , finance .",Project Manager,691
8,So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .,Industrial Designer,692

8,Yeah .,Project Manager,714
8,Not just pointing out on it .,User Interface,715
8,It's the same for the presenta for the presentations .,Project Manager,716
8,You can do it from here .,Project Manager,716
8,That's much easier than standing there .,Project Manager,716
8,Yeah .,User Interface,717
8,And so you've {disfmarker},Project Manager,718
8,"Yeah , and p just point with a mouse .",Industrial Designer,719
8,No use to draw on the board itself .,User Interface,720

8,"Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .",User Interface,729
8,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,730

8,No .,Industrial Designer,734
8,"{gap} I think {disfmarker} Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,735
8,Digital pen .,Marketing,736

8,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,738
8,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing,739
8,{vocalsound} We did it .,User Interface,740

8,Yeah .,Project Manager,761
8,But it's for the next team .,Project Manager,761
8,We don't have to do that .,Project Manager,761
8,"Yeah , but it {disfmarker} You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think .",Industrial Designer,762
8,That's for {gap} .,User Interface,763

9,Any ideas ?,Project Manager,132
9,It's about {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,133
9,One point four or something like that .,User Interface,134
9,"mm , mm yeah .",Industrial Designer,135

9,Seventeen .,Project Manager,143
9,Seventeen Pounds .,Marketing,144

9,Should we be making notes of this ?,Marketing,146
9,We can just refer to this later can't we ?,Marketing,146
9,"I think so , I think so ,",Project Manager,147
9,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,148
9,"I'll be able to um pull it up ,",Project Manager,149
9,"Yeah , okay .",Marketing,150
9,or I could put it in the shared folder or something .,Project Manager,151
9,"Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those {disfmarker} the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway .",Industrial Designer,152
9,Okay .,Marketing,153
9,"So , it'd still be {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,154
9,Really ?,Project Manager,155
9,Right .,Marketing,156
9,"yeah , we had to buy one {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,157
9,So,Marketing,158
9,Mm .,Project Manager,159
9,I think {disfmarker},Project Manager,159
9,"so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?",Marketing,160
9,"Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so",Project Manager,161
9,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,162
9,"Okay , pretty huge margin .",User Interface,163
9,half of the selling price is taken up by building it .,Project Manager,164
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,165
9,Mm .,Marketing,166
9,"Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros ,",Project Manager,167
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,168
9,which is uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,169
9,In our first year ?,Marketing,170
9,"Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so .",Project Manager,171
9,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,171
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,172
9,So then {disfmarker},User Interface,173
9,You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups,Marketing,174
9,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,175
9,"just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone",Marketing,176
9,"No , yeah .",Project Manager,177
9,{disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone .,Marketing,178
9,Okay .,Marketing,178
9,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,179
9,Big target group {vocalsound} .,Marketing,180
9,"yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point ,",Project Manager,181
9,No .,Marketing,182
9,"just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .",Project Manager,183
9,Mm .,Marketing,184
9,Okay .,Project Manager,185
9,What are your experiences with remote controls ?,Project Manager,185
9,"I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up",Project Manager,185
9,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,186
9,"so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into ,",Project Manager,187
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,188
9,"Yeah ,",User Interface,189
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,190
9,Alright .,Marketing,191
9,that c,User Interface,192
9,but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again .,Project Manager,193
9,"I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,",Project Manager,193
9,Yeah uh .,Industrial Designer,194
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,195
9,"but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .",Project Manager,196
9,Use all the ones at the same time .,Industrial Designer,197
9,Right .,Marketing,198
9,"Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}",User Interface,199
9,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,200
9,Okay .,User Interface,201
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,202
9,'cause you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,203
9,"My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things .",Marketing,204
9,"But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,",Marketing,204
9,Mm .,Project Manager,205
9,"I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .",Marketing,206
9,"Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean",Project Manager,207
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,208
9,{disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do,Project Manager,209
9,Mm .,Marketing,210
9,and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .,Project Manager,211
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,212
9,Mm .,Marketing,213
9,"And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,",Marketing,213
9,Yeah .,Project Manager,214
9,symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .,Marketing,215
9,So simplification of symbols you could think of .,User Interface,216
9,{vocalsound} Um .,Project Manager,217
9,"When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .",Project Manager,217
9,Oh yeah .,Marketing,218
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,218
9,"'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,",Project Manager,219
9,Mm .,Marketing,220
9,"it's obvious what you're doing , um .",Project Manager,221
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,222
9,Mm .,Industrial Designer,223
9,"Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,",Marketing,224
9,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,225
9,"Menu , alright .",User Interface,225
9,"I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,",Marketing,226
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,227
9,Uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface,228
9,so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .,Marketing,229
9,"Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .",User Interface,230
9,"With menus , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,231
9,"And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .",User Interface,232
9,Yeah .,Marketing,233
9,What about the older generation ?,Project Manager,234
9,What about granny and grandads ?,Project Manager,234
9,{vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number .,User Interface,235
9,"Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .",Project Manager,236
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,237
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,238
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,238
9,Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?,Marketing,238
9,Right .,User Interface,239
9,"I don't think they tape things ,",Project Manager,240
9,"Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,241
9,I don't think they use {disfmarker},Project Manager,242
9,Right .,Marketing,243
9,Right .,Marketing,243
9,"So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,",Marketing,243
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,244
9,"that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,",Marketing,245
9,"Mm , yeah , the age gap .",Project Manager,246
9,"Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .",Industrial Designer,247
9,Mm .,Project Manager,248
9,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,249
9,"I don't know , I d",Project Manager,250
9,But I don't know how {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,251
9,"I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .",Project Manager,252
9,Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer,253
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,254
9,"I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one",Project Manager,255
9,Right .,Marketing,256
9,"and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .",Project Manager,257
9,"Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,",Industrial Designer,258
9,{vocalsound},Marketing,259
9,Yeah .,Project Manager,260
9,"you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .",Industrial Designer,261
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,262
9,Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?,Marketing,262
9,Okay .,User Interface,263
9,Teletext has got that option as well .,Project Manager,264
9,"Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .",Marketing,265
9,Yeah .,Project Manager,266
9,Or what about kind of a dual function ?,Project Manager,266
9,"In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things",Project Manager,266
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,267
9,"and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .",Project Manager,268
9,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,269
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,269
9,Mm .,Marketing,269
9,"The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .",Marketing,269
9,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,270
9,"Mm , okay .",User Interface,271
9,S,User Interface,271
9,"I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}",Project Manager,272
9,Y,Industrial Designer,273
9,It might,User Interface,274
9,Yeah ?,Marketing,275
9,"it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .",User Interface,276
9,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,277
9,"Yes , no that's important .",Project Manager,278
9,But it might have its cost implications .,User Interface,279
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,280
9,"Yeah , like smaller .",Marketing,281
9,Okay .,Project Manager,282
9,"And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?",Marketing,283
9,Mm .,Project Manager,284
9,Right .,User Interface,285
9,Something that's easily moulded and produced .,Marketing,286
9,Yeah .,Project Manager,287
9,Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys .,Marketing,288
9,{vocalsound},Marketing,288
9,"{vocalsound} Um , right , okay",Project Manager,289
9,No uh uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,290
9,"we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .",Project Manager,291
9,Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .,Project Manager,291
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,292
9,Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,292
9,Sure .,Project Manager,293
9,about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ?,Industrial Designer,294
9,"The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui",Industrial Designer,294
9,Ah right .,Marketing,295
9,Okay .,User Interface,296
9,Okay .,Project Manager,297
9,Okay .,Marketing,298
9,I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic,Industrial Designer,299
9,Sure b y yeah .,Marketing,300
9,and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,301
9,"But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point ,",Marketing,302
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,303
9,"we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,",Marketing,304
9,Mm .,Project Manager,305
9,I presume it would .,Marketing,306
9,I would {disfmarker},Project Manager,307
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,308
9,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,308
9,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,309
9,it would probably .,Project Manager,310
9,I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .,Project Manager,310
9,"They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,",Project Manager,310
9,Right .,Marketing,311
9,so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .,Project Manager,312
9,Okay .,Marketing,313
9,"Okay , so let's break it up there .",Project Manager,314
9,Okay ?,Project Manager,314
9,Okay .,Industrial Designer,315
9,'Kay .,Marketing,316
9,"So , see you in half an hour .",Project Manager,317
9,Do we go back to our room ?,Marketing,318
9,Yep ?,Marketing,318
9,"Mm , yeah .",User Interface,319
9,"I think so , yeah .",Project Manager,320
10,{vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .,Project Manager,1
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,2
10,"So ,",Project Manager,3
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,4
10,as the previous meeting I will be the secretary,Project Manager,5
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,6
10,and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision .,Project Manager,7
10,So I will first uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,7
10,"No y you do the minutes first , or ?",Marketing,8
10,What ?,Project Manager,9
10,No ?,Marketing,10
10,"I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .",Project Manager,11
10,Okay .,Marketing,12
10,Yep .,User Interface,13
10,"So , we'll {disfmarker} S",Project Manager,14
10,Yeah .,User Interface,15
10,technical accessoire ?,Project Manager,16
10,No no no .,User Interface,17
10,Interface ?,Project Manager,18
10,Yeah .,User Interface,19
10,This .,Project Manager,20
10,Mm .,User Interface,21
10,So uh first I will present the concept of user interface .,User Interface,21
10,Um there's three concepts in the user interface .,User Interface,21
10,So first one it's a Google controller .,User Interface,21
10,The second is a fancy controller .,User Interface,21
10,The last one is uh intelligent controller .,User Interface,21
10,So there are three concepts in our controller .,User Interface,21
10,"Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller .",User Interface,21
10,"Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .",User Interface,21
10,So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions .,User Interface,21
10,Uh this is a first concept of our controller .,User Interface,21
10,"The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um",User Interface,21
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,22
10,Mm .,Marketing,23
10,A nice one .,Industrial Designer,24
10,attractive .,User Interface,25
10,"Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .",User Interface,25
10,{vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .,Project Manager,26
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,27
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,28
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know",User Interface,29
10,"{vocalsound} It's very big ,",Project Manager,30
10,if you're {disfmarker},User Interface,31
10,{vocalsound} yeah .,Project Manager,32
10,Yeah .,User Interface,33
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,34
10,It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it .,User Interface,35
10,"{vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,",User Interface,35
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,36
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,37
10,yeah .,User Interface,38
10,"Yeah , why not .",Project Manager,39
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,39
10,Yeah .,User Interface,40
10,Yeah .,User Interface,40
10,"We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,",Project Manager,41
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,42
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,42
10,so .,Project Manager,43
10,Yeah .,User Interface,44
10,Mm .,Marketing,45
10,So the last uh concept is intelligent .,User Interface,46
10,"We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,",User Interface,46
10,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,47
10,Mm .,Marketing,48
10,"so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition .",User Interface,49
10,Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .,User Interface,49
10,Okay .,Project Manager,50
10,Something else ?,Project Manager,50
10,Okay .,User Interface,51
10,No .,User Interface,51
10,There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .,User Interface,51
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,52
10,"I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,",Project Manager,53
10,Yeah .,User Interface,54
10,Yeah .,User Interface,54
10,"but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels .",Project Manager,55
10,Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?,Project Manager,55
10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,56
10,"Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?",Project Manager,57
10,Y,User Interface,58
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,59
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,60
10,Maybe .,Industrial Designer,60
10,"or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while .",Project Manager,61
10,You don't think so ?,Project Manager,61
10,Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .,User Interface,62
10,"Yeah , sure .",Project Manager,63
10,"For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .",User Interface,64
10,I,Project Manager,65
10,"Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so .",Industrial Designer,66
10,That's true .,Project Manager,67
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,67
10,One and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,68
10,"Yeah , but suppose you got a cold .",Project Manager,69
10,You have a mute remote controller .,Project Manager,69
10,Yeah .,User Interface,70
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,71
10,Mm .,Marketing,72
10,So you can use your gesture .,User Interface,73
10,That's no problem .,User Interface,73
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,73
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,74
10,Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?,Marketing,75
10,Broken arm ?,Project Manager,76
10,For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker},User Interface,77
10,Okay .,Marketing,78
10,Okay .,Marketing,78
10,"Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ?",Project Manager,79
10,Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?,Project Manager,79
10,Yeah .,User Interface,80
10,{vocalsound} Yep .,Industrial Designer,81
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,81
10,But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway .,Marketing,82
10,Why ?,Project Manager,83
10,"Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .",User Interface,84
10,If you have one brother and one sister,Project Manager,85
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Marketing,86
10,"and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,",Project Manager,87
10,"Yeah , but the {disfmarker}",Marketing,88
10,"so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,",Project Manager,89
10,{vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah,Industrial Designer,90
10,"Yeah , it's very interesting .",User Interface,91
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,91
10,Yeah but this {disfmarker},Marketing,92
10,so .,Project Manager,93
10,but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control,Industrial Designer,94
10,Yeah .,Marketing,95
10,because the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,96
10,Yeah .,User Interface,97
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,98
10,I don't think it {disfmarker},Marketing,99
10,"but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .",Project Manager,100
10,{vocalsound} That's right .,Industrial Designer,101
10,You're not you're not obliged to share it .,Project Manager,102
10,"Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .",Marketing,103
10,"Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,104
10,"Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller .",User Interface,105
10,"Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,",User Interface,105
10,{vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,106
10,No .,Marketing,107
10,"so it's c come to channel three ,",User Interface,108
10,"No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .",Marketing,109
10,I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker},User Interface,110
10,"Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .",Project Manager,111
10,It's advantage .,User Interface,112
10,Yeah .,Marketing,113
10,And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to,Industrial Designer,114
10,"Yeah , but one other question .",Project Manager,115
10,"manual controllers , eh .",Industrial Designer,116
10,How how much will it cost ?,Project Manager,117
10,"No , more expensive maybe .",Industrial Designer,118
10,How much ?,User Interface,119
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,120
10,Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .,Project Manager,120
10,No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker},User Interface,121
10,Some some efficient .,Project Manager,122
10,Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker},Marketing,123
10,"No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .",User Interface,124
10,So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ?,Project Manager,125
10,Or ?,Project Manager,125
10,"Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}",User Interface,126
10,"Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,127
10,it's uh {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,128
10,It's {disfmarker},User Interface,128
10,But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built .,Marketing,129
10,"Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .",Marketing,129
10,"Well y y you have also the language problem ,",Industrial Designer,130
10,No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface,131
10,you know when you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,132
10,Mm-mm .,Project Manager,133
10,"'Cause it it have to be universal ,",Industrial Designer,134
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,135
10,I agree with uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,135
10,so .,Industrial Designer,136
10,"The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .",User Interface,137
10,Yeah .,Marketing,138
10,"Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international",Project Manager,139
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,140
10,Yeah .,User Interface,141
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,142
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,143
10,remote control .,Project Manager,144
10,We need something that is international .,Project Manager,144
10,Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .,Project Manager,144
10,Yeah .,User Interface,145
10,The recognition system will be able to understand French .,Project Manager,146
10,"If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,",Project Manager,146
10,Yeah .,User Interface,147
10,so .,Project Manager,148
10,"Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation",User Interface,149
10,"Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}",Marketing,150
10,Yeah but you know .,Industrial Designer,151
10,The product {disfmarker} The pro,Industrial Designer,151
10,mechanism .,User Interface,152
10,It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese .,User Interface,152
10,It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .,User Interface,152
10,"{vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,153
10,"Mm , okay .",Project Manager,154
10,Yeah .,Marketing,155
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",User Interface,156
10,And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?,Project Manager,157
10,it's {disfmarker},User Interface,158
10,Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah .,Industrial Designer,159
10,But {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,159
10,Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .,User Interface,160
10,"Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}",Project Manager,161
10,So {disfmarker},User Interface,162
10,"Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .",Industrial Designer,163
10,Yeah .,User Interface,164
10,Yeah .,User Interface,164
10,"If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .",Industrial Designer,165
10,Mm .,Marketing,166
10,"Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .",User Interface,167
10,"Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,",Industrial Designer,168
10,Yeah .,User Interface,169
10,because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,170
10,Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker},User Interface,171
10,Oh really ?,Industrial Designer,172
10,{vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,172
10,Oh .,Project Manager,173
10,"Yeah ,",Marketing,174
10,Seems to be quite complex .,Project Manager,175
10,"but then w Yeah ,",Marketing,176
10,Comple,Industrial Designer,177
10,"No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} .",User Interface,178
10,we have to take care of the twelve Euros,Marketing,179
10,"And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?",Project Manager,180
10,problem .,Marketing,181
10,And where will be they ?,Project Manager,182
10,Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?,Project Manager,182
10,No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone .,User Interface,183
10,It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller .,User Interface,183
10,"Yeah , but where is the controller ?",Project Manager,184
10,Okay .,Marketing,185
10,Where is the controller ?,User Interface,186
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,187
10,"It's in your family , in your home .",User Interface,188
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,188
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,189
10,"Yeah , but we're {disfmarker}",Project Manager,190
10,"No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker}",Marketing,191
10,here it's uh an object .,Project Manager,192
10,But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .,Project Manager,192
10,Yeah .,User Interface,193
10,Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .,User Interface,193
10,A microphone maybe .,Industrial Designer,194
10,"Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .",Project Manager,195
10,"If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .",Project Manager,195
10,To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .,Industrial Designer,196
10,You just want to interact with television .,Project Manager,197
10,"Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you",User Interface,198
10,"I if you say one , he switch to channel ,",Industrial Designer,199
10,you use your command,User Interface,200
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,201
10,yeah .,Industrial Designer,202
10,and you do s your gesture .,User Interface,203
10,but you can lose it .,Project Manager,204
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,204
10,No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker},User Interface,205
10,So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .,Industrial Designer,206
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,207
10,Yeah .,User Interface,208
10,Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box,Project Manager,209
10,Devic,Industrial Designer,210
10,and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .,Project Manager,211
10,Yeah .,Marketing,212
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,213
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,213
10,Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control .,Industrial Designer,213
10,Ah .,Project Manager,214
10,Yeah .,User Interface,215
10,But you would still have the buttons .,Marketing,216
10,Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ?,Marketing,216
10,Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?,Marketing,216
10,think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker},User Interface,217
10,"Okay , so you {disfmarker}",Marketing,218
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,219
10,yeah .,User Interface,220
10,yeah .,Marketing,221
10,You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another .,User Interface,222
10,Mm .,Project Manager,223
10,"Yeah , I dunno .",Marketing,224
10,It's a bit risky risky .,Marketing,224
10,I think so .,Project Manager,225
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,226
10,"No ,",User Interface,227
10,And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker},Project Manager,228
10,that's quite inter quite attractive .,User Interface,229
10,"But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y",Industrial Designer,230
10,"Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .",User Interface,231
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,231
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Marketing,232
10,Yeah but i i {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,233
10,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,234
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,234
10,I dunno .,Marketing,235
10,We should have confidence in technology .,User Interface,236
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,236
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , we should .",Industrial Designer,237
10,{vocalsound} Uh .,Industrial Designer,237
10,Hmm .,Project Manager,238
10,"So , what do you think ?",Project Manager,238
10,We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .,Project Manager,238
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,239
10,What ?,Marketing,240
10,"Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?",Project Manager,241
10,"If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .",Marketing,242
10,"More features , yeah .",User Interface,243
10,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,244
10,But if if if it like doubles uh,Marketing,245
10,"I think he need a control that is very reliable ,",Industrial Designer,246
10,no one would would be interested .,Marketing,247
10,so .,Industrial Designer,248
10,So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .,Project Manager,249
10,Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ?,Project Manager,249
10,Hmm ?,Project Manager,249
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,250
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,250
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,251
10,"Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .",Project Manager,252
10,You think it's possible ?,Project Manager,252
10,Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts .,User Interface,253
10,So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?,User Interface,253
10,"There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?",User Interface,253
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,254
10,Yeah .,Marketing,255
10,"No ,",Marketing,255
10,Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker},User Interface,256
10,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing,257
10,It's not really the {disfmarker} we,Industrial Designer,258
10,Y,Marketing,259
10,"we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that .",Industrial Designer,260
10,But uh I think a user need {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,260
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ .",User Interface,261
10,"You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,",User Interface,261
10,"No ,",Marketing,262
10,but {disfmarker},User Interface,263
10,but you need you need new remote controller then .,Marketing,264
10,"Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,",Marketing,264
10,Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah,Industrial Designer,265
10,Okay .,User Interface,266
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing,267
10,if we can send email from it .,Industrial Designer,268
10,"But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .",User Interface,269
10,No .,Marketing,270
10,No .,Marketing,270
10,Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,271
10,Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing,272
10,"Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,",User Interface,273
10,Yeah .,Marketing,274
10,"Yeah , but uh we want so",Project Manager,275
10,"but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .",User Interface,276
10,"Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker}",Marketing,277
10,That's {disfmarker},User Interface,278
10,True .,Marketing,279
10,"the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products .",User Interface,280
10,"Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .",Project Manager,281
10,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,282
10,Yeah .,User Interface,283
10,"{vocalsound} And for all the person of the family maybe ,",Industrial Designer,284
10,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,285
10,You don't need to tune it .,Project Manager,286
10,"so , yeah .",Industrial Designer,287
10,"Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?",User Interface,288
10,"Yeah , why not ?",Project Manager,289
10,If it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,289
10,"I mean , for example the goo y",Marketing,290
10,Because you have new {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,291
10,you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .,Marketing,292
10,Yeah .,User Interface,293
10,Yeah .,User Interface,293
10,I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google .,Marketing,294
10,"Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine ,",Marketing,294
10,Yeah .,User Interface,295
10,"so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .",Marketing,296
10,Yeah .,User Interface,297
10,"Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .",User Interface,297
10,"Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition",Marketing,298
10,The {disfmarker} then nn,User Interface,299
10,or {disfmarker},Marketing,300
10,no .,User Interface,301
10,"if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .",Marketing,302
10,Tha,User Interface,303
10,Not too expensive too .,Project Manager,304
10,But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .,User Interface,305
10,See {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Marketing,306
10,That's the same {disfmarker},User Interface,307
10,"That's the problem ,",Marketing,308
10,yeah .,User Interface,309
10,yeah .,Marketing,310
10,"I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .",Marketing,310
10,{vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,311
10,Yeah .,User Interface,312
10,"But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product",Marketing,313
10,Yeah .,User Interface,314
10,and so .,Marketing,315
10,Okay .,Project Manager,316
10,So,Project Manager,316
10,"I mean , that's the point .",Marketing,317
10,let's go to the Industrial Designer .,Project Manager,318
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,319
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,320
10,Okay .,User Interface,321
10,"Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .",Project Manager,322
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,323
10,Yeah .,User Interface,324
10,Two ?,Project Manager,325
10,"Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,326
10,Working ?,Project Manager,327
10,"Yeah , working design ,",Industrial Designer,328
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,329
10,so .,Industrial Designer,330
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,331
10,So I think {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,332
10,I can {disfmarker},Project Manager,333
10,Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ?,Industrial Designer,334
10,I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one .,Industrial Designer,334
10,Okay .,Project Manager,335
10,It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,336
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing,337
10,It's the working design .,Industrial Designer,338
10,Sorry .,Industrial Designer,338
10,{vocalsound} Component design .,Industrial Designer,338
10,It's okay {vocalsound},Project Manager,339
10,So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,340
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,341
10,What ?,Industrial Designer,342
10,Are you inst,Industrial Designer,342
10,Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker},Project Manager,343
10,It did didn't r receive it .,User Interface,344
10,Didn't receive it .,User Interface,344
10,Maybe you you record it somewhere else .,Project Manager,345
10,I don't think so .,Industrial Designer,346
10,Participant one .,User Interface,347
10,Participant one .,User Interface,347
10,Interface concept .,Project Manager,348
10,No .,Project Manager,348
10,Hmm .,Marketing,349
10,Mm mm .,Project Manager,350
10,Oh .,Industrial Designer,351
10,Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer .,Industrial Designer,351
10,Yeah .,Marketing,352
10,Uh .,Project Manager,353
10,{vocalsound} Nope .,Project Manager,353
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,353
10,Dunno .,Marketing,354
10,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer,355
10,Yes .,Industrial Designer,355
10,It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker},Project Manager,356
10,I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker},Marketing,357
10,I can say it to you without .,Industrial Designer,358
10,"Yeah , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,359
10,"Yeah , maybe we can first come to",User Interface,360
10,"No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,361
10,uh to Frahan .,User Interface,362
10,"With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,",User Interface,362
10,"I think it's more interesting what he says ,",Marketing,363
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,364
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,365
10,then present it later .,User Interface,366
10,okay .,Marketing,367
10,exac,Industrial Designer,368
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,369
10,You will had s some more information in {disfmarker},Project Manager,370
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,371
10,I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .,Project Manager,372
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,373
10,"Yeah , true .",Marketing,374
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,375
10,Okay .,User Interface,376
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,376
10,"In fact , I don't know ,",Industrial Designer,377
10,So .,Project Manager,378
10,Okay .,Project Manager,378
10,I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,379
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,380
10,"Okay , never mind .",Project Manager,381
10,so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r,Industrial Designer,382
10,Okay .,User Interface,383
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,384
10,of the remote control .,Industrial Designer,385
10,So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside,Industrial Designer,385
10,Okay .,User Interface,386
10,Okay .,User Interface,386
10,and {disfmarker} so .,Industrial Designer,387
10,"So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,",Industrial Designer,387
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,388
10,so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one .,Industrial Designer,389
10,"So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,",Industrial Designer,389
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,390
10,"so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,",Industrial Designer,391
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,392
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,393
10,"or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .",Industrial Designer,394
10,Okay .,Project Manager,395
10,Okay .,User Interface,396
10,"And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation",Industrial Designer,397
10,Uh-huh .,User Interface,398
10,or will it be a battery like the classical battery so .,Industrial Designer,399
10,"And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come",Industrial Designer,399
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,400
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,400
10,"and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .",Industrial Designer,401
10,"Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control",Project Manager,402
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,403
10,"Yeah , yeah mm .",Industrial Designer,403
10,and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers,Project Manager,404
10,"Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,405
10,Yeah .,Marketing,406
10,Yeah .,Marketing,406
10,"and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,",Project Manager,407
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,408
10,no ?,Project Manager,409
10,"Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,",Industrial Designer,410
10,So .,Project Manager,411
10,"but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,",Industrial Designer,412
10,Yeah .,Marketing,413
10,Okay .,Project Manager,414
10,so hmm .,Industrial Designer,415
10,And what tha what about the uh materials ?,Project Manager,416
10,"And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common",Industrial Designer,417
10,"Impersonal , mm-hmm .",Project Manager,418
10,"it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,",Industrial Designer,419
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,420
10,Special for {disfmarker},Marketing,421
10,"or you know , you can have some {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,422
10,"Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .",Project Manager,423
10,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,424
10,"Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood",Industrial Designer,425
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,426
10,Yeah .,Marketing,427
10,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,428
10,Mm .,Project Manager,428
10,and it can be interesting .,Industrial Designer,429
10,"Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .",Project Manager,430
10,"And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .",Industrial Designer,431
10,"Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .",Project Manager,432
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,433
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,433
10,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,433
10,And you think that we will be {disfmarker},Project Manager,434
10,"Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,",Industrial Designer,435
10,Okay .,Project Manager,436
10,so .,Industrial Designer,437
10,So wood .,Project Manager,438
10,{gap},Industrial Designer,439
10,And what about the buttons ?,Project Manager,440
10,"I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion",Industrial Designer,441
10,"No it's fashion , yeah .",Project Manager,442
10,"and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .",Industrial Designer,443
10,What about the touch scr touch screen ?,Marketing,444
10,For example .,Marketing,444
10,It's it's expensive I I guess .,Marketing,444
10,{vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .,Industrial Designer,445
10,Mm .,Marketing,446
10,"But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean .",Industrial Designer,447
10,It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,447
10,Yeah .,Marketing,448
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,449
10,So you got email ?,User Interface,450
10,I dunno .,Project Manager,451
10,{vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .,Project Manager,451
10,Okay .,Marketing,452
10,Participant four ?,Project Manager,453
10,Functional requirements ?,Project Manager,453
10,"Uh no , trend watching .",Marketing,454
10,{vocalsound} The other one .,Marketing,454
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,454
10,This one ?,Project Manager,455
10,Yeah .,Marketing,456
10,"Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .",Marketing,456
10,{vocalsound},Project Manager,457
10,"So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting .",Marketing,458
10,Um user really really want a fancy look and feel .,Marketing,458
10,"They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay .",Marketing,458
10,"Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically",Marketing,458
10,Mm .,User Interface,459
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,460
10,"but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .",Marketing,461
10,Okay .,Project Manager,462
10,"At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .",Marketing,463
10,So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .,Marketing,463
10,{gap},Industrial Designer,464
10,Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay .,Marketing,465
10,"Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,",Marketing,465
10,Ah yes .,Industrial Designer,466
10,"okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .",Marketing,467
10,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,468
10,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,468
10,'Cause it's it's really what people want .,Marketing,469
10,"Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .",Marketing,469
10,"And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .",Marketing,469
10,"Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three .",Marketing,469
10,Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .,Marketing,469
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,470
10,"So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris",Marketing,471
10,And fruit and vegetables yeah .,Industrial Designer,472
10,we go to the fruits and vede vegetables .,Marketing,473
10,"And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,",Marketing,473
10,{vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay .,Industrial Designer,474
10,okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .,Marketing,475
10,"Okay , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,476
10,I dunno .,Marketing,477
10,"Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?",Industrial Designer,478
10,Yeah thi this is this would be like um,Marketing,479
10,Pla S,Industrial Designer,480
10,"plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh",Marketing,481
10,"Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,482
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,482
10,"device , so um",Marketing,483
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,484
10,"Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion .",Marketing,485
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,486
10,"So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .",Project Manager,487
10,"So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting ,",Project Manager,487
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,488
10,Solar .,Industrial Designer,488
10,"Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker}",Marketing,489
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,490
10,maybe will attract,Project Manager,491
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,492
10,Mm-hmm,Marketing,493
10,It will be a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,494
10,pro-ecology consumers .,Project Manager,495
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,496
10,Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .,Project Manager,497
10,"Yeah , I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,498
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,498
10,Case .,Project Manager,499
10,Later ?,User Interface,500
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,500
10,So you think {gap} case .,Project Manager,501
10,Something spongy .,Project Manager,501
10,{vocalsound} Someth no wood .,Project Manager,501
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,502
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,503
10,{vocalsound},Marketing,504
10,{vocalsound} No wood but {disfmarker} Plastic ?,Industrial Designer,505
10,"Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .",Marketing,506
10,Would some {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,507
10,Pla,User Interface,508
10,Maybe you {disfmarker},Project Manager,509
10,"I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know .",Industrial Designer,510
10,"It depends on the design we want ,",Industrial Designer,510
10,"Yeah , maybe the base .",Marketing,511
10,so .,Industrial Designer,512
10,It's it's natural .,Project Manager,513
10,But still y,Marketing,514
10,"Th The feeling is natural ,",Project Manager,515
10,"Yeah , it's natural",Industrial Designer,516
10,Yeah .,Marketing,517
10,and i,Industrial Designer,518
10,so maybe we can stay with wood .,Project Manager,519
10,"And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol",Industrial Designer,520
10,"Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .",Marketing,521
10,"Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .",Industrial Designer,522
10,But it's still fashion .,Project Manager,523
10,"But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,",Marketing,524
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,525
10,or,Marketing,526
10,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,527
10,I dunno .,Marketing,528
10,something that you can {vocalsound} into it .,Project Manager,529
10,Yeah .,Marketing,530
10,Uh and what about the user interface concept ?,Project Manager,531
10,{vocalsound} Google and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,532
10,Google and fancy ?,Project Manager,533
10,"and fancy , f how about the the voice ?",Industrial Designer,534
10,{vocalsound} And {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,534
10,Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .,Project Manager,535
10,Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested,Industrial Designer,536
10,Uh yes .,User Interface,537
10,and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control .,Industrial Designer,538
10,Yeah .,Marketing,539
10,Yeah .,User Interface,540
10,Yeah .,User Interface,540
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,541
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,541
10,The smart controller .,User Interface,542
10,{vocalsound},User Interface,542
10,"But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,",Industrial Designer,543
10,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,544
10,so .,Industrial Designer,545
10,but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .,Project Manager,546
10,"But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .",Industrial Designer,547
10,That's true .,Project Manager,548
10,Yeah {disfmarker} d,Marketing,549
10,Okay .,User Interface,550
10,"So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,",Project Manager,551
10,I dunno .,Marketing,552
10,Mm .,User Interface,553
10,"maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .",Project Manager,554
10,Yeah .,User Interface,555
10,It's good .,User Interface,555
10,And L_C_D_ buttons .,Project Manager,556
10,"Yeah , L_C_D_ .",Industrial Designer,557
10,"Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .",Project Manager,558
10,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,559
10,And pf what can we think a supplement to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,559
10,What interface ?,Marketing,560
10,"Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value .",Project Manager,561
10,I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,562
10,"It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,562
10,With a module ?,Project Manager,563
10,You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use,Project Manager,563
10,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,564
10,"commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .",Project Manager,565
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,566
10,Mm .,Industrial Designer,566
10,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,567
10,"To push button , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,568
10,"Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .",Industrial Designer,568
10,Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .,Project Manager,569
10,"Yeah , turning {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,570
10,"Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,",Industrial Designer,570
10,"So ,",Project Manager,571
10,so .,Industrial Designer,572
10,adding some vocal commands .,Project Manager,573
10,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,574
10,Simple ones ?,Project Manager,575
10,"Yeah , simple ones for {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,576
10,Okay .,Project Manager,577
10,{vocalsound} So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} we'll {disfmarker} you will all have to work in in your direction .,Project Manager,577
10,"So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .",Project Manager,577
10,Yeah .,User Interface,578
10,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,579
10,Yep .,User Interface,580
10,Yeah .,User Interface,580
10,"Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons {vocalsound}",Project Manager,581
10,"{vocalsound} expensive buttons {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , to make some new {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,582
10,and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .,Project Manager,583
10,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,584
10,{vocalsound} And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .,Project Manager,585
10,"Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .",Marketing,586
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,587
10,"Okay , fruits .",Industrial Designer,588
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,589
10,If possible .,Marketing,590
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,591
10,"And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really {disfmarker} it will be seen in the remote control .",Project Manager,592
10,"Need it to be , okay .",Industrial Designer,593
10,"So you will have {disfmarker} Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,",Project Manager,594
10,Yeah .,User Interface,595
10,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,596
10,so you will have to model model something .,Project Manager,597
10,Okay .,User Interface,598
10,Yep,User Interface,598
10,And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .,Project Manager,599
10,Okay .,Industrial Designer,600
10,"So ,",Project Manager,601
10,Okay .,User Interface,602
10,"no more questions , we can close the session .",Project Manager,603
10,"Sounds good , mm-hmm .",Industrial Designer,604
10,Hmm .,Marketing,605
10,Yeah .,Project Manager,606
10,"Okay , cool .",Project Manager,606
10,Okay .,Marketing,607
11,Okay .,Marketing,1
11,"'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time .",Project Manager,2
11,Welcome everybody .,Project Manager,2
11,Um hope your sessions went well .,Project Manager,2
11,"Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control .",Project Manager,2
11,"Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there .",Project Manager,2
11,"Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet .",Project Manager,2
11,Right .,Project Manager,2
11,Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker},Project Manager,2
11,And I can start if you want .,Marketing,3
11,Mm .,Marketing,3
11,sure .,Project Manager,4
11,Is there an order ?,Marketing,5
11,No .,Marketing,5
11,Hm ?,Project Manager,6
11,We haven't decided on an order .,Marketing,7
11,"No , any any order's fine .",Project Manager,8
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,8
11,First .,Marketing,9
11,Okay .,Marketing,9
11,"Um , how do I put this {disfmarker}",Marketing,9
11,Just uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,10
11,I'll just put the cable in .,Marketing,11
11,"Oh yeah , sorry .",Project Manager,12
11,{gap} Is that it ?,Marketing,13
11,Can you see ?,Marketing,13
11,"{vocalsound} Oh , here .",Marketing,13
11,Okay .,Marketing,13
11,So what happens it doesn't work ?,Marketing,13
11,It sh it takes a few seconds I think .,Project Manager,14
11,You may need to {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,15
11,{vocalsound} Who's that ?,User Interface,16
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,16
11,{vocalsound},Marketing,17
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,18
11,No .,Marketing,19
11,But sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,20
11,Is it in the right thing ?,Marketing,21
11,"it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .",Industrial Designer,22
11,"Oh wait , um .",Marketing,23
11,Uh .,Marketing,23
11,You need to help me .,Marketing,23
11,{vocalsound},Marketing,23
11,"Uh-huh , and then press function .",Project Manager,24
11,{vocalsound},Marketing,25
11,and F_ eight .,Project Manager,26
11,Yeah .,Marketing,27
11,Could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker},User Interface,28
11,"Oh , wait .",Marketing,29
11,oh .,User Interface,30
11,That's {disfmarker} is that it ?,Marketing,31
11,Adjusting .,Industrial Designer,32
11,Here we are .,Project Manager,33
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,33
11,The cable might be a little loose or something .,Industrial Designer,34
11,"Oh , you got it .",Industrial Designer,34
11,Right here we are .,Marketing,35
11,Oh .,Project Manager,36
11,Is it on ?,Project Manager,36
11,We're here .,Marketing,37
11,Okay .,Project Manager,38
11,"Okay , um .",Marketing,39
11,"In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out .",Marketing,39
11,"Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about .",Marketing,39
11,"Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons .",Marketing,39
11,"Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ .",Marketing,39
11,I don't know what R_S_I_ means .,Marketing,39
11,"Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .",Marketing,39
11,Hm .,Project Manager,40
11,"Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .",Marketing,41
11,So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .,Marketing,41
11,They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour .,Marketing,41
11,"And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order .",Marketing,41
11,"Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .",Marketing,41
11,"The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .",Marketing,41
11,"Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .",Marketing,41
11,"And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing .",Marketing,41
11,"Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .",Marketing,41
11,"{vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .",Marketing,41
11,'Kay .,Project Manager,42
11,Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ?,Marketing,43
11,Do I give this to someone else ?,Marketing,43
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,44
11,Just move right on .,Project Manager,44
11,Right .,User Interface,45
11,So get this .,User Interface,45
11,"Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?",User Interface,45
11,{vocalsound} Uh function F_ eight .,Project Manager,46
11,Function F_ eight .,Marketing,47
11,'Kay .,User Interface,48
11,What's function ?,User Interface,48
11,It's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th,Project Manager,49
11,"Oh function , I see it .",User Interface,50
11,yeah .,Project Manager,51
11,Yeah should be {disfmarker},Project Manager,51
11,There we go .,User Interface,52
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,52
11,It should be {gap} yeah .,Project Manager,53
11,Okay .,User Interface,54
11,Um .,User Interface,54
11,This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user .,User Interface,54
11,So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} .,User Interface,54
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,55
11,And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .,User Interface,56
11,"Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ .",User Interface,56
11,Does it have like capacity to change the channels ?,User Interface,56
11,Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ?,User Interface,56
11,"And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ?",User Interface,56
11,"And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .",User Interface,56
11,"{vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .",User Interface,56
11,{vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .,User Interface,56
11,{gap},Project Manager,57
11,Okay .,User Interface,58
11,You need the little thingy .,User Interface,58
11,Ooh .,User Interface,58
11,How do I um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,59
11,S That's on view .,Marketing,60
11,Right .,Industrial Designer,61
11,Oh .,Marketing,62
11,"Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting .",Industrial Designer,63
11,"Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,63
11,And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .,Industrial Designer,63
11,"So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration .",Industrial Designer,63
11,"And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall .",Industrial Designer,63
11,And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works .,Industrial Designer,63
11,"Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,63
11,"And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead .",Industrial Designer,63
11,"That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .",Industrial Designer,63
11,"Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver .",Industrial Designer,63
11,Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .,Industrial Designer,63
11,So that concludes my presentation .,Industrial Designer,63
11,'Kay .,Project Manager,64
11,Do you know about like {disfmarker},User Interface,65
11,Mm ?,Industrial Designer,66
11,"I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,67
11,"Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .",Industrial Designer,68
11,Okay .,User Interface,69
11,Cool .,User Interface,69
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,69
11,Okay .,Project Manager,70
11,Well thank you everybody .,Project Manager,70
11,Um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in .,Project Manager,70
11,"Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list .",Project Manager,70
11,"Um ,",Project Manager,70
11,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,71
11,"also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television .",Project Manager,72
11,"Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess .",Project Manager,72
11,"Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that .",Project Manager,72
11,Okay .,Project Manager,72
11,Um .,Project Manager,72
11,So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions .,Project Manager,72
11,"Um , yeah .",Project Manager,72
11,{vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker},Project Manager,72
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,73
11,"I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker}",Project Manager,74
11,Like in terms of,User Interface,75
11,How it looks or {disfmarker},Marketing,76
11,"how it looks , or like what it does ?",User Interface,77
11,wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s,Project Manager,78
11,Okay .,User Interface,79
11,the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing .,Project Manager,80
11,So .,Project Manager,80
11,Yeah .,User Interface,81
11,Okay .,User Interface,81
11,So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?,User Interface,81
11,{vocalsound} I think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,82
11,Mm .,Project Manager,82
11,So {disfmarker},User Interface,83
11,It's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer,84
11,Okay .,User Interface,85
11,So the {disfmarker},User Interface,85
11,"{gap} the the buzzer you mean ,",Marketing,86
11,"yeah , yeah , yeah .",User Interface,87
11,Locator .,Industrial Designer,88
11,"yeah , for sure , yeah .",Marketing,89
11,"So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,",User Interface,90
11,"Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .",Project Manager,91
11,what was it ?,User Interface,92
11,Well that's for speech recognition .,Marketing,93
11,"Oh , uh .",Project Manager,94
11,Well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,95
11,Oh .,User Interface,96
11,And screen .,Marketing,97
11,That's only for speech recognition and screen .,Marketing,97
11,"I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,",Industrial Designer,98
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,99
11,"and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,",Industrial Designer,100
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,101
11,Mm .,Project Manager,102
11,"or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly ,",Industrial Designer,103
11,Yeah .,User Interface,104
11,I mean {disfmarker},Marketing,105
11,I'm not sure how you would implement it .,Industrial Designer,106
11,Yeah .,User Interface,107
11,I just put the values {vocalsound} in .,Marketing,108
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,109
11,"And if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker}",Project Manager,110
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,111
11,"But um the screen is the same as what , {gap}",Marketing,112
11,It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,113
11,"if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .",Project Manager,114
11,Yeah .,User Interface,115
11,"Yeah , I'm happy with that .",Marketing,116
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,117
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,118
11,Right so um {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,119
11,Hu yeah .,User Interface,120
11,{vocalsound} Completely .,Marketing,121
11,Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .,User Interface,122
11,Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .,Industrial Designer,123
11,Yeah .,Marketing,124
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,125
11,Yeah .,User Interface,126
11,"Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .",Industrial Designer,127
11,Okay .,User Interface,128
11,Okay .,User Interface,128
11,Yeah .,Marketing,129
11,Okay .,Project Manager,130
11,Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .,Industrial Designer,131
11,Alright .,User Interface,132
11,Okay .,Marketing,133
11,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface,134
11,So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker},Project Manager,135
11,It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,136
11,right .,Project Manager,137
11,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,137
11,"So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?",Marketing,138
11,"Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .",Industrial Designer,139
11,Okay .,Marketing,140
11,Okay .,Marketing,140
11,So it's now like a two-part thing .,User Interface,141
11,"Yeah , so it would be a two part package .",Industrial Designer,142
11,Okay .,User Interface,143
11,Alright .,User Interface,143
11,Okay .,Marketing,144
11,So we get to design that too .,User Interface,145
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,146
11,{vocalsound} Make it fashionable .,User Interface,147
11,"Um , okay .",User Interface,147
11,So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .,Project Manager,148
11,Yeah I think so .,Industrial Designer,149
11,Yeah .,Marketing,150
11,Just there .,Marketing,150
11,Huh .,Project Manager,151
11,Okay .,Project Manager,151
11,Mm .,Marketing,152
11,Are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it .,Marketing,152
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,153
11,Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?,Marketing,154
11,We probably leave that .,Project Manager,155
11,"I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,155
11,Okay .,Marketing,156
11,Yeah .,User Interface,157
11,Then it can live anywhere .,User Interface,157
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Project Manager,158
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,159
11,Yeah .,User Interface,160
11,Okay .,Marketing,161
11,"For the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?",Marketing,161
11,Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ?,Industrial Designer,162
11,Are we just having a radio ?,Marketing,163
11,On the phone .,Marketing,163
11,"Um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,",Industrial Designer,164
11,T,User Interface,165
11,You don't need a light .,Marketing,166
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,166
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,167
11,"I think that's what the phone has ,",Industrial Designer,168
11,Yeah yeah .,Marketing,169
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,170
11,"I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .",Industrial Designer,171
11,"And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so",Project Manager,172
11,You can hear it's under the couch yeah .,Marketing,173
11,{disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,174
11,So i Yeah .,User Interface,175
11,"Um , {vocalsound} {gap} So need the other buttons .",Marketing,176
11,So we have this {disfmarker} mm .,Marketing,176
11,"So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um ,",Project Manager,177
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,178
11,That was that was me .,User Interface,179
11,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,180
11,{vocalsound},Marketing,180
11,"they're {disfmarker} I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .",Project Manager,181
11,I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes .,User Interface,182
11,Oh really .,Project Manager,183
11,"'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .",Project Manager,183
11,And uh,User Interface,184
11,Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ?,Industrial Designer,185
11,Yeah .,User Interface,186
11,They're not {disfmarker} no .,Project Manager,187
11,"They're not , no .",Marketing,188
11,"Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .",Industrial Designer,189
11,S,User Interface,190
11,"Yeah , that's right , yeah .",Project Manager,191
11,{vocalsound} It not V_H_S_ here ?,Marketing,192
11,But D_V_D_ probably is .,Project Manager,193
11,"Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .",Industrial Designer,194
11,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,195
11,"And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .",Project Manager,196
11,But V_C_R_s {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,197
11,"Yeah , for sure .",Marketing,197
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,198
11,Yeah .,User Interface,199
11,So .,User Interface,199
11,"Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,",User Interface,199
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,200
11,"like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .",User Interface,201
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,202
11,Well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} I think we can just design the channels ?,Marketing,203
11,"I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much ,",Marketing,203
11,S,Project Manager,204
11,Yeah .,User Interface,205
11,Huh .,Project Manager,206
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,207
11,Yeah .,User Interface,208
11,s and it's usually that red,Marketing,209
11,Yeah .,User Interface,210
11,and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .,Marketing,211
11,Yeah .,User Interface,212
11,"You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on .",Project Manager,213
11,"So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker}",Project Manager,213
11,"Oh okay , yeah .",Marketing,214
11,It seems like that would be hard though .,User Interface,215
11,But {disfmarker},Project Manager,216
11,"I mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker}",User Interface,217
11,It might be confusing .,Project Manager,218
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,218
11,yeah .,User Interface,219
11,Just 'cause I wouldn't {disfmarker} I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button .,User Interface,219
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,219
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,220
11,Besides you like to be able to go power .,Project Manager,220
11,"Yeah , I never think to hold something down .",Industrial Designer,221
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,221
11,Yeah .,Marketing,222
11,{vocalsound} I have the power {vocalsound},Project Manager,223
11,Yeah .,User Interface,224
11,B {vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,224
11,I guess .,Project Manager,225
11,So we definitely want a power button and numbers .,Project Manager,225
11,Right .,Project Manager,225
11,Yeah .,User Interface,226
11,"Well even um iPod thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of",Marketing,227
11,"That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .",User Interface,228
11,scrolling {disfmarker} I don't know .,Marketing,229
11,Mm .,Project Manager,230
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,230
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,231
11,Yeah .,Marketing,232
11,Because people li seem {disfmarker} now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no {disfmarker} Know you don't have one two three four five {disfmarker},Marketing,232
11,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,233
11,"I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,",User Interface,233
11,Mm .,Project Manager,234
11,"it's it's funny like you f like I just {disfmarker} I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and {disfmarker} it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .",User Interface,235
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,236
11,"Yeah yeah , it's just {disfmarker} and it's one thing which has everything .",Marketing,237
11,"Yeah , and it is {disfmarker} yeah .",User Interface,238
11,"It is really {disfmarker} but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?",User Interface,238
11,Well can't it tell the {disfmarker} like can't you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker},Marketing,239
11,"Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .",Industrial Designer,240
11,Yeah .,User Interface,241
11,Okay .,User Interface,241
11,you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker},Marketing,242
11,Yeah .,User Interface,243
11,Yeah .,User Interface,243
11,Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .,User Interface,243
11,Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,244
11,Like a disc .,User Interface,245
11,Yeah .,User Interface,245
11,Yeah .,User Interface,245
11,It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .,User Interface,245
11,okay .,Project Manager,246
11,I've never used one .,Project Manager,246
11,No .,Project Manager,246
11,"It's like l this {disfmarker} like that , and then you do that .",Marketing,247
11,Okay .,Project Manager,248
11,Okay .,Project Manager,248
11,Yeah .,User Interface,249
11,Yeah and then .,User Interface,249
11,"And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .",Marketing,250
11,Okay .,User Interface,251
11,So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker},User Interface,251
11,"Yeah , you can {disfmarker}",Marketing,252
11,Well i,Project Manager,253
11,zap .,User Interface,254
11,"Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker}",Marketing,255
11,Okay .,User Interface,256
11,"We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .",Project Manager,257
11,Yeah .,Marketing,258
11,Yeah .,User Interface,259
11,So volume could be like the top it and the bottom {disfmarker} So do you need to {disfmarker},User Interface,259
11,"Doesn't it rotate though ,",Industrial Designer,260
11,okay .,User Interface,261
11,so it'll be moving around .,Industrial Designer,262
11,Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker},User Interface,263
11,What do you mean the function ?,Marketing,264
11,"I mean like okay , 'cause so {disfmarker} I dunno , I guess {disfmarker} Okay {disfmarker} so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise .",User Interface,265
11,"That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .",User Interface,265
11,Yeah .,Marketing,266
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,267
11,But then {disfmarker},User Interface,268
11,Yeah .,Marketing,269
11,"so if you wanna switch to the {disfmarker} to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .",User Interface,270
11,Yeah but it knows for some reason .,Marketing,271
11,It just {disfmarker},User Interface,272
11,The iPod knows .,Marketing,273
11,It just kno {vocalsound} the iPod knows .,User Interface,274
11,{vocalsound} S,User Interface,274
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,275
11,{vocalsound} If it works on an iPod then it works .,Industrial Designer,276
11,{vocalsound},Marketing,277
11,Huh .,Project Manager,278
11,Yeah .,User Interface,279
11,So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .,User Interface,279
11,I don't have one .,Industrial Designer,280
11,"Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .",Marketing,281
11,Okay .,User Interface,282
11,That's what I mean .,User Interface,282
11,Okay .,User Interface,282
11,"Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .",User Interface,282
11,Oh .,Industrial Designer,283
11,So it's like holding {disfmarker},Project Manager,284
11,"And then {disfmarker} well if you do that it goes , but if you {disfmarker} like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .",Marketing,285
11,You can {disfmarker} o And you you {disfmarker} is there an extra actual button ?,Project Manager,286
11,Or are you actually {disfmarker} you're just using the mouse to go up and down .,Project Manager,286
11,Well what you {disfmarker},Marketing,287
11,Like {disfmarker},Project Manager,288
11,It's like a b,User Interface,289
11,"for the iPod you press an {disfmarker} w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .",Marketing,290
11,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,291
11,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,291
11,Right .,Project Manager,291
11,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,291
11,"But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker}",Marketing,292
11,"Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?",Project Manager,293
11,Yeah .,Marketing,294
11,Like you could just have {disfmarker},Project Manager,295
11,"I don't know ,",Marketing,296
11,"Oh , like {disfmarker}",Project Manager,297
11,"you could click and then have it up and down ,",Marketing,298
11,Oh you could actually {disfmarker},Project Manager,299
11,Like {disfmarker},User Interface,300
11,but I think {disfmarker},Marketing,301
11,I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .,User Interface,302
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,303
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,304
11,Yeah {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,305
11,"But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be {disfmarker} is that part of {disfmarker}",User Interface,306
11,Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker},Project Manager,307
11,{vocalsound} I don't think so .,Industrial Designer,308
11,"yeah , I dunno , I dunno .",User Interface,309
11,"they have so much memory though , that's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,310
11,You don't think so ?,User Interface,311
11,Okay .,User Interface,311
11,I don't think it's the wheel dealy .,Industrial Designer,312
11,I think it {disfmarker},Marketing,313
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,314
11,I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they {disfmarker} it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .,Project Manager,314
11,Okay .,User Interface,315
11,Yeah .,Marketing,316
11,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,317
11,{vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,317
11,Yeah .,User Interface,318
11,I'm thinking we could {disfmarker} if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .,User Interface,318
11,And they're re-programmable aren't they ?,Industrial Designer,319
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,320
11,"You can put on your songs and then put on a different set ,",Industrial Designer,321
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,322
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,322
11,"that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .",Industrial Designer,323
11,Yeah .,User Interface,324
11,S,Project Manager,325
11,Yeah .,User Interface,326
11,"Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker}",User Interface,326
11,Yeah .,Marketing,327
11,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,328
11,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,328
11,Yeah yeah yeah .,Marketing,329
11,Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass .,Marketing,329
11,"Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation {vocalsound} , is that people find it {disfmarker} find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote",Marketing,329
11,Yeah .,User Interface,330
11,and that's another thing they complained about .,Marketing,331
11,Mm .,Project Manager,332
11,Yeah .,User Interface,333
11,"Um , what other buttons were there ?",Marketing,334
11,Volume {disfmarker} oh we've ts just said that .,Marketing,334
11,So okay .,User Interface,335
11,Channel selection .,Marketing,336
11,"This is just for T_V_ , it's not for {disfmarker} or it is {disfmarker} does need to be compatible with {disfmarker}",User Interface,337
11,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,338
11,"I {disfmarker} A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,",Industrial Designer,339
11,Yeah .,User Interface,340
11,"You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .",Project Manager,341
11,So how do you switch {disfmarker},User Interface,342
11,Menu .,Marketing,343
11,and menu maybe .,Industrial Designer,344
11,Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer,344
11,So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker},Project Manager,345
11,Okay .,User Interface,346
11,So like if we had that {disfmarker},User Interface,346
11,But we'll hold off on that 'cause {disfmarker},Project Manager,347
11,Yeah .,User Interface,348
11,But s yeah uh .,Project Manager,349
11,But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .,Marketing,350
11,"That's true , yeah .",User Interface,351
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,352
11,"So , I know I'm not c really clear on what {disfmarker}",User Interface,353
11,"But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .",Industrial Designer,354
11,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,355
11,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Marketing,356
11,Mm .,Project Manager,357
11,Mm .,Project Manager,357
11,So you'd have to have like {disfmarker},User Interface,358
11,Yeah .,Marketing,359
11,"I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like .",User Interface,360
11,So {disfmarker},User Interface,360
11,Yeah .,Project Manager,361
11,Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .,Industrial Designer,362
11,"Yeah ,",User Interface,363
11,"Yeah , it is only fun",Marketing,364
11,"but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .",User Interface,365
11,But i Yeah .,Project Manager,366
11,Oh .,Industrial Designer,367
11,But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,367
11,Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker},User Interface,368
11,but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .,Industrial Designer,369
11,"So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that ,",User Interface,370
11,"Um , yeah , let's think about it",Project Manager,371
11,that like {disfmarker},User Interface,372
11,Yes we can try that .,Industrial Designer,373
11,'cause we need to wrap up .,Project Manager,374
11,{vocalsound},User Interface,375
11,{vocalsound},Project Manager,376
12,It's {disfmarker},User Interface,1
12,Bonjour .,Marketing,2
12,It won't wake up .,User Interface,3
12,Yeah .,User Interface,3
12,I was a bit early .,User Interface,3
12,Like {disfmarker} What ?,User Interface,3
12,Why ?,Marketing,4
12,"No , I just came in .",User Interface,5
12,Uh normally I was one of them .,User Interface,5
12,Okay .,Marketing,6
12,Come on .,User Interface,7
12,Hello .,Project Manager,8
12,Check check check check .,Marketing,9
12,Oop .,Project Manager,10

12,The power light doesn't work .,Marketing,12
12,You turned it off .,Marketing,12
12,But how ?,User Interface,13
12,"Ah , there it is .",User Interface,13
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,14
12,Okay .,Project Manager,15
12,Uh .,User Interface,16
12,I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials .,Industrial Designer,17
12,So I'll discuss them with you .,Industrial Designer,17
12,"Okay , we're just going to the {gap} later .",Project Manager,18
12,Okay .,Marketing,19
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,20
12,"Yeah , I received an email as well .",User Interface,21
12,So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .,Project Manager,22
12,{vocalsound} Oh .,Marketing,23
12,{gap},Project Manager,24
12,Hmm .,Marketing,25
12,Which one was mine ?,User Interface,26
12,So that's me .,Project Manager,27
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,28
12,Uh okay .,Project Manager,29
12,So {disfmarker} Uh okay .,Project Manager,29
12,"Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .",Project Manager,29
12,"{gap} What's it called , I dunno .",Project Manager,29
12,Whatever .,Project Manager,29
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,30
12,The minutes .,User Interface,31
12,"Okay , so we just talked about uh {disfmarker} Oh you want me to show that there or {disfmarker}",Project Manager,32
12,"No ,",User Interface,33
12,Mm no .,Industrial Designer,34
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,35
12,"Okay ,",Project Manager,36
12,just tell us .,User Interface,37
12,we just talked about it looks .,Project Manager,38
12,Has to look nice .,Project Manager,38
12,Usability is very important .,Project Manager,38
12,People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones .,Project Manager,38
12,"Um {disfmarker} It has to be very basic , not too many buttons .",Project Manager,38
12,Light switches on if you use a button .,Project Manager,38
12,Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility .,Project Manager,38
12,And it has to be easy to learn .,Project Manager,38
12,That were the things I uh make minutes of .,Project Manager,38
12,"And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button .",Project Manager,38
12,That are the functions .,Project Manager,38
12,That right ?,Project Manager,38
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,39
12,Okay .,Project Manager,40
12,Yes .,User Interface,41
12,"So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your {disfmarker}",Project Manager,42
12,Shall I start ?,Marketing,43
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,44
12,{gap} {vocalsound} No .,Marketing,45
12,Okay well {disfmarker} I received an email {disfmarker} Okay .,Marketing,45
12,"I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .",Marketing,45
12,"It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it .",Marketing,45
12,"Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .",Marketing,45
12,So it's very important for us to create something new .,Marketing,45
12,"So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .",Marketing,45
12,Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .,Marketing,45
12,Uh this uh aspect is the most important one .,Marketing,45
12,Uh it came out of the research .,Marketing,45
12,It uh is twice important as the following .,Marketing,45
12,{vocalsound} The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .,Marketing,45
12,Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .,Marketing,45
12,"And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .",Marketing,45
12,Hmm .,User Interface,46
12,"But um {vocalsound} this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .",Marketing,47
12,But we already have the flashing flashing light on the {disfmarker},Project Manager,48
12,{vocalsound} Uh maybe maybe something new .,Marketing,49
12,"Yeah , more .",User Interface,50
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,51
12,"We have to discuss about it s uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh {gap}",Marketing,52
12,Okay .,Project Manager,53
12,"Well , I'll I'll get back on it .",User Interface,54
12,features not uh do not exist in current remote controls .,Marketing,55
12,And that's very hard I think .,Marketing,55
12,Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .,Marketing,55
12,But uh that was an overall uh point .,Marketing,55
12,We already discussed that .,Marketing,55
12,Um I've got one picture .,Marketing,55
12,Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .,Marketing,55
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,56
12,So I took uh that part of the webpage .,Marketing,57
12,"And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends .",Marketing,57
12,"This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe .",Marketing,57
12,But it's about uh clothes and shoes .,Marketing,57
12,Hmm .,Project Manager,58
12,"But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .",Marketing,59
12,Spongy .,User Interface,60
12,"But spongy , what what does spongy says ?",Marketing,61
12,Spongy .,Industrial Designer,62
12,"Spongy , like sponge .",User Interface,63
12,Spongy .,Marketing,64
12,Okay .,Marketing,64
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,64
12,"So rubber , kind of .",Industrial Designer,65
12,Uh soft materials .,User Interface,66
12,"But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,",Project Manager,67
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,68
12,because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .,Project Manager,69
12,So it has to be {vocalsound} flexible .,Project Manager,69
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface,70
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,71
12,Yeah .,Marketing,72
12,"Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there .",Marketing,72
12,But I didn't knew uh knew what it means .,Marketing,72
12,So spongy means y Yeah .,Marketing,72
12,It's like a sponge .,Industrial Designer,73
12,"Soft , sponge .",User Interface,74
12,So it's also a stress-ball .,Marketing,75
12,That's a good {disfmarker} That's a good idea .,Project Manager,76
12,If it's de like that .,Project Manager,76
12,"That's good , a good idea .",Project Manager,76
12,"Yeah , somewhat like {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,77
12,"Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .",User Interface,78
12,Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ?,Project Manager,79
12,How are you gonna make it ?,User Interface,80
12,R_ soft .,Project Manager,81
12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,82
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,83
12,"I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .",Industrial Designer,84
12,Okay .,Project Manager,85
12,Okay ?,Marketing,86
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,87
12,What do I think ?,Marketing,88
12,"Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .",Marketing,88
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,89
12,Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front .,Marketing,90
12,Because it's uh it's hot .,Marketing,90
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,91
12,And uh some basic uh colour fronts .,Marketing,92
12,{vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something .,Marketing,92
12,"Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .",Marketing,92
12,"{vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .",Marketing,92
12,Yeah .,User Interface,93
12,"Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno .",Marketing,94
12,We have to discuss about that .,Marketing,94
12,Uh y yeah .,Marketing,94
12,Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative .,Marketing,94
12,"Yeah , how do we do that ?",Marketing,94
12,Maybe speech ?,Marketing,94
12,We ma must have some kind of gadget .,Marketing,94
12,"Yeah , I'll get back on that .",User Interface,95
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,96
12,So {disfmarker},Marketing,97
12,{vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .,Project Manager,98
12,Intro,Marketing,99
12,Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .,Project Manager,100
12,Yeah .,Marketing,101
12,"Well ,",User Interface,102
12,"Yeah , that's the problem .",Marketing,103
12,That's the main problem .,Marketing,103
12,I got f also an email from the the technology department .,User Interface,104
12,So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .,Marketing,105
12,"They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech .",User Interface,106
12,So they recommended using it .,User Interface,106
12,Okay .,Project Manager,107
12,Well {disfmarker},User Interface,108
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,109
12,Okay .,Marketing,110
12,I'll check what they exact mean .,User Interface,111
12,Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .,Marketing,112
12,So uh {disfmarker},User Interface,113
12,"Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost .",Industrial Designer,114
12,But maybe it's cheap,Industrial Designer,114
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,115
12,and it's easy to implement .,Industrial Designer,116
12,th that's the only problem .,User Interface,117
12,"I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh",User Interface,117
12,{gap},Marketing,118
12,"if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .",User Interface,119
12,Oh .,Marketing,120
12,It's mass production .,Marketing,120
12,"So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker}",Marketing,120
12,Since you have to uh configure speech thing .,User Interface,121
12,But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,122
12,"Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .",User Interface,123
12,Yeah .,Marketing,124
12,But how uh we we're gonna make many of those .,Marketing,124
12,"So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} .",Marketing,124
12,"Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah .",Project Manager,125
12,But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .,Project Manager,125
12,"Yeah , so uh we gotta de",User Interface,126
12,So uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,127
12,We have to decide on that .,User Interface,128
12,Yeah .,Marketing,129
12,Okay .,Marketing,129
12,That was this ?,Marketing,129
12,Mm uh {disfmarker},User Interface,130
12,"Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced .",Industrial Designer,131
12,And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip .,Industrial Designer,131
12,And this is more expensive than all the other chips .,Industrial Designer,131
12,So,Industrial Designer,131
12,L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker},User Interface,132
12,it's m the most expensive .,Industrial Designer,133
12,"Yeah , it says in the email .",Industrial Designer,133
12,The display requires an advanced chip .,Industrial Designer,133
12,Okay .,User Interface,134
12,And speech recognition ?,User Interface,134
12,"Yeah , probably too .",Industrial Designer,135
12,Advanced {gap} .,User Interface,136
12,Yeah .,User Interface,136
12,"I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,137
12,I'll I'll give you my design .,User Interface,138
12,"Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need .",Industrial Designer,139
12,If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .,Industrial Designer,139
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,140
12,So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design .,User Interface,140
12,So I did some searching on the internet .,User Interface,140
12,I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .,User Interface,140
12,I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .,User Interface,140
12,I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players .,User Interface,140
12,Mobile phones .,User Interface,140
12,"Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .",Project Manager,141
12,More modern .,User Interface,142
12,Y yes .,User Interface,142
12,Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller .,User Interface,142
12,"'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides .",User Interface,142
12,"And here you just have one , few buttons .",User Interface,142
12,So that's that's the main difference .,User Interface,142
12,But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this .,User Interface,142
12,"And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}",User Interface,142
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,143
12,"It's the most important part , I think .",User Interface,144
12,"But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple .",User Interface,144
12,Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit .,User Interface,144
12,Uh basic buttons .,User Interface,144
12,"On-off , mute .",User Interface,144
12,"And th maybe two others , I dunno .",User Interface,144
12,Text buttons .,User Interface,144
12,"Yeah , maybe the teletext tel",Project Manager,145
12,"Yeah , text button , maybe there and there .",User Interface,146
12,"And then the colour buttons , if we want it on .",User Interface,146
12,"I don't find it very usable ,",User Interface,146
12,No .,Project Manager,147
12,but it's {disfmarker},User Interface,148
12,"No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it .",Marketing,149
12,Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well .,User Interface,150
12,So {disfmarker},User Interface,150
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,151
12,"and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod .",User Interface,152
12,"They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four .",User Interface,152
12,And uh f above ten .,User Interface,152
12,{vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker},User Interface,152
12,But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display .,Industrial Designer,153
12,No no .,User Interface,154
12,That th there is no display there .,User Interface,154
12,But it's on the place of the display .,User Interface,154
12,And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .,User Interface,154
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,155
12,So the focus is on these two parts .,User Interface,156
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,157
12,So you don't see all the buttons you else need .,User Interface,158
12,{vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use .,Project Manager,159
12,Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .,Project Manager,159
12,Uh well um {disfmarker},User Interface,160
12,So you can't use your thumb for it .,Project Manager,161
12,This is how it is now .,User Interface,162
12,Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume .,User Interface,162
12,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,163
12,I think it is on uh on the bottom too .,Industrial Designer,164
12,down there .,Project Manager,165
12,But it's not not the best best .,Project Manager,165
12,Yeah .,User Interface,166
12,Well here we have also side scrolls .,User Interface,166
12,I dunno if we can use that .,User Interface,166
12,Do we want to use {disfmarker},User Interface,166
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,167
12,"Yeah , for volume .",Project Manager,168
12,"For volume , or a channel .",Project Manager,168
12,"Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .",Industrial Designer,169
12,"Yeah , why not .",Project Manager,170
12,For volume ?,User Interface,171
12,Well then we can even simplify it more .,User Interface,171
12,Scroll .,Industrial Designer,172
12,By just putting the volume on the side .,User Interface,173
12,And the channels as well .,Project Manager,174
12,And and just channel buttons here .,User Interface,175
12,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,176
12,But I think uh {disfmarker},User Interface,177
12,"Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used .",Industrial Designer,178
12,"And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .",Industrial Designer,178
12,Well .,User Interface,179
12,"Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here .",User Interface,179
12,"Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .",Industrial Designer,180
12,"Yeah , that's better .",Project Manager,181
12,They're on top ?,User Interface,182
12,"Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ .",Project Manager,183
12,Put that on the button bottom .,Project Manager,183
12,Because uh you can't hold it .,Industrial Designer,184
12,You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .,Industrial Designer,184
12,You mean uh these to the low ?,User Interface,185
12,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,186
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,186
12,Except from the on-off button .,Project Manager,186
12,Oh okay .,User Interface,187
12,"Well , yeah .",User Interface,187
12,"But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three .",Industrial Designer,188
12,So maybe we can put that on the bottom .,Industrial Designer,188
12,Mm {disfmarker} Maybe .,User Interface,189
12,"I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker}",User Interface,189
12,Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .,Industrial Designer,190
12,"Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below .",User Interface,191
12,It's harder to zap .,User Interface,191
12,So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} .,User Interface,191
12,"I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .",User Interface,191
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,192
12,"And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good .",User Interface,193
12,"That's that's good , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,194
12,"{vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .",User Interface,195
12,So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .,User Interface,195
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,196
12,But uh the position of course can be different .,User Interface,197
12,"It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .",User Interface,197
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,198
12,So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker},User Interface,199
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,200
12,"I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .",User Interface,201
12,"No , I think th the the top buttons are okay .",Industrial Designer,202
12,They sh Those should be on top .,Industrial Designer,202
12,Okay .,User Interface,203
12,"Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,203
12,"But uh we we can switch those two ,",Industrial Designer,204
12,"Those two , yeah .",User Interface,205
12,yeah .,Industrial Designer,206
12,"And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right .",User Interface,207
12,{gap},User Interface,207
12,Okay .,Marketing,208
12,Well that's that's my findings .,User Interface,209
12,So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look .,User Interface,209
12,M_P_ three player .,User Interface,209
12,"And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then .",User Interface,209
12,"I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .",User Interface,209
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,210
12,"Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager,210
12,To use {disfmarker},User Interface,211
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,212
12,"So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons .",User Interface,213
12,Which won't look good on the front side I think .,User Interface,213
12,Okay .,Project Manager,214
12,No .,Industrial Designer,215
12,So that's something we have to decide on .,User Interface,216
12,"Yeah , we have to keep it simple .",Industrial Designer,217
12,"We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .",Project Manager,218
12,Yeah .,User Interface,219
12,What we're gonna do .,User Interface,219
12,Okay .,User Interface,219
12,"Okay , the component design .",Industrial Designer,220
12,"I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge .",Industrial Designer,220
12,So uh this was on the web site .,Industrial Designer,220
12,"If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red .",Industrial Designer,220
12,So flashy kinda colours .,Industrial Designer,220
12,"Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes .",Industrial Designer,220
12,Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like .,Industrial Designer,220
12,"Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay .",Project Manager,221
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,221
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,222
12,Yeah well uh iPod is trendy .,User Interface,223
12,And it is well curved {gap} square .,User Interface,223
12,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,224
12,Square .,Marketing,225
12,Like .,Marketing,225
12,"Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .",Industrial Designer,226
12,Okay .,User Interface,227
12,So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,227
12,So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .,Industrial Designer,228
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,229
12,Not uh the old uh box look .,User Interface,229
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,230
12,And um sports and gaming device style characteristics .,Industrial Designer,230
12,"I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of",Industrial Designer,230
12,"Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control .",Project Manager,231
12,"looking , I think .",Industrial Designer,232
12,Mm .,Marketing,233
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,234
12,So the colours also .,Project Manager,235
12,"Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker}",User Interface,236
12,"So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .",Project Manager,237
12,Black yellow control .,User Interface,238
12,{vocalsound},User Interface,238
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,239
12,Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .,Project Manager,240
12,"Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .",Industrial Designer,241
12,"Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together .",User Interface,242
12,But {disfmarker},User Interface,242
12,We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .,Project Manager,243
12,"No , okay .",Industrial Designer,244
12,"That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,244
12,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,245
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,246
12,"We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .",Industrial Designer,247
12,"Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ?",User Interface,248
12,Can we do that ?,User Interface,248
12,So {disfmarker},User Interface,248
12,"Yeah , it's cool .",Project Manager,249
12,Yep .,Project Manager,249
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,250
12,Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue,Industrial Designer,250
12,And still trans,Project Manager,251
12,Yes .,User Interface,252
12,Still still transparent .,Project Manager,253
12,So {disfmarker},User Interface,254
12,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,255
12,Oh yeah .,Marketing,256
12,Yeah .,User Interface,257
12,But with all with logo on it .,User Interface,257
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,258
12,Okay .,Project Manager,259
12,"Well this is a remote control , a very old one .",Industrial Designer,260
12,Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the components .,Industrial Designer,260
12,The case has just a {disfmarker} Here's black .,Industrial Designer,260
12,"Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material .",Project Manager,261
12,Uh I'm not sure .,Project Manager,261
12,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,262
12,{gap} Yeah .,User Interface,263
12,Maybe .,Industrial Designer,264
12,But anyways uh it should be transparent .,Industrial Designer,264
12,"We decided that , huh ?",Industrial Designer,264
12,Well one of the options .,User Interface,265
12,S,Industrial Designer,266
12,"You can {disfmarker} Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .",User Interface,267
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,268
12,So you can just replace them I think .,User Interface,269
12,"That was the idea ,",User Interface,269
12,"Yeah , we could do that .",Industrial Designer,270
12,or just uh release one .,User Interface,271
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,272
12,"Just give five with them , just in a box .",Project Manager,272
12,{vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker},Project Manager,272
12,"Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Or just uh sell different ones .",User Interface,273
12,"Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .",Industrial Designer,274
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,275
12,Cool .,Project Manager,275
12,So you can still th look through it .,Industrial Designer,276
12,Yeah .,User Interface,277
12,Yeah .,User Interface,277
12,Um the buttons .,Industrial Designer,278
12,Normal rubber I think .,Industrial Designer,278
12,Like normal ordinary buttons .,Industrial Designer,278
12,Soft .,Industrial Designer,278
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,279
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,280
12,I uh I dunno .,User Interface,281
12,"It it could be like a Nokia , like {gap} plastic .",Project Manager,282
12,"A more {disfmarker} Yeah , just uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,283
12,{vocalsound} Uh uh {disfmarker},Marketing,284
12,That's better prob,Project Manager,285
12,With the hard hard buttons .,Industrial Designer,286
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,287
12,I think uh rubber really has an odd look .,User Interface,288
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,289
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,290
12,Yeah .,Marketing,291
12,"The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .",Marketing,291
12,Yeah .,User Interface,292
12,It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape .,Marketing,293
12,Uh it's n doesn't {disfmarker} Is {vocalsound} uh a button uh um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How do you say it ?,Marketing,293
12,"Yeah , it's it's all on one level .",Industrial Designer,294
12,It it didn't it i it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background .,Marketing,295
12,"Yeah , on one level .",Industrial Designer,296
12,It is in uh the c a remote control uh {disfmarker},Marketing,297
12,Yeah .,User Interface,298
12,"Yeah , I know what you mean .",Industrial Designer,299
12,So we have to keep it on the one level .,Industrial Designer,299
12,Like th the top it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,299
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,300
12,Yeah .,Marketing,301
12,like mobile phones .,User Interface,302
12,Like uh the iPod .,User Interface,302
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,303
12,Uh just {disfmarker},User Interface,304
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,305
12,"Yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager,306
12,"Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic .",Industrial Designer,307
12,Then the buttons ?,Industrial Designer,307
12,{vocalsound} I dunno what uh kind of material it is .,User Interface,308
12,I think .,Industrial Designer,309
12,Or maybe {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,309
12,But {disfmarker},User Interface,310
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,311
12,But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material .,Project Manager,312
12,Just only the basic uh,Project Manager,312
12,Oops .,User Interface,313
12,"basic remote control from normal plastic ,",Project Manager,314
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,315
12,and,Project Manager,316
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,317
12,the rounds of it from softer s,Project Manager,318
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,319
12,Yeah .,User Interface,320
12,And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the L_E_D_ .,Industrial Designer,321
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,321
12,I dunno .,Project Manager,322
12,The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient .,Industrial Designer,323
12,And back light L_E_D_s .,Industrial Designer,323
12,Y,Project Manager,324
12,Yeah .,User Interface,325
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,326
12,Cool .,Project Manager,327
12,"But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .",Industrial Designer,328
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,329
12,So if you put {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,330
12,Y i if you {disfmarker} The numbers could be can be {disfmarker},Project Manager,331
12,Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh {disfmarker},User Interface,332
12,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,333
12,Yeah .,User Interface,334
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,335
12,Or it runs the whole {disfmarker},User Interface,336
12,"Yeah , but we can still make it transparent .",Industrial Designer,337
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,337
12,They can choose .,Project Manager,338
12,"Yeah , you can halfs transparent ,",User Interface,339
12,Or no,Industrial Designer,340
12,or just that it's comes out a bit .,User Interface,341
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,342
12,Good .,Industrial Designer,342
12,"And in green colour , the back lights",Industrial Designer,342
12,"Different , I think , also .",User Interface,343
12,or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,344
12,Blue .,Project Manager,345
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,345
12,Yeah ?,Industrial Designer,346
12,Blue or red .,User Interface,347
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,348
12,"Whatever you want it , I think .",User Interface,349
12,{gap} Yeah .,Marketing,350
12,Uh depends on the colour of the {disfmarker},User Interface,351
12,"Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .",Project Manager,352
12,Uh i {gap} {vocalsound},Marketing,353
12,You have to choose {disfmarker},Project Manager,354
12,"Yeah , that's true .",User Interface,355
12,But {disfmarker},User Interface,355
12,"No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs .",Industrial Designer,356
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,356
12,Is it {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,357
12,"Yeah ,",Marketing,358
12,I I know {disfmarker} I dunno .,Industrial Designer,359
12,Is {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,359
12,but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?,Marketing,360
12,"Yeah , it can .",User Interface,361
12,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,362
12,'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .,User Interface,363
12,You {disfmarker},Marketing,364
12,Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .,Industrial Designer,365
12,Maybe put some different ones in it .,Project Manager,366
12,Doesn't matter .,Project Manager,366
12,"It's just {disfmarker} No , just some LED .",Project Manager,366
12,I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .,User Interface,367
12,I think it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,368
12,And I can change the colour of it .,User Interface,369
12,"Okay , cool .",Project Manager,370
12,Just make it some different colours .,Project Manager,370
12,"Blue , red and green , or something .",Project Manager,370
12,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,371
12,"Maybe it's too expensive , but it {disfmarker} I th I don't think so .",Industrial Designer,371
12,"Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet .",User Interface,372
12,So {disfmarker},User Interface,372
12,Hmm .,Marketing,373
12,Then uh some more technical things .,Industrial Designer,374
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,375
12,"I don't know what it is , but it should be there {vocalsound} I think .",Industrial Designer,376
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,377
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,378
12,{vocalsound},User Interface,379
12,"Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .",Industrial Designer,380
12,"Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager,381
12,W {vocalsound} So we d we just need this and {vocalsound} this transistors and resonators .,Industrial Designer,382
12,There's all these kind of things .,Industrial Designer,382
12,{vocalsound},User Interface,383
12,Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .,Industrial Designer,384
12,I'm sure we can fit in .,User Interface,385
12,So I guess we j we just need that .,Industrial Designer,386
12,{gap},Marketing,387
12,Yeah .,User Interface,388
12,I don't know what they do or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,389
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,390
12,"Okay yeah ,",Marketing,391
12,We just {disfmarker},User Interface,392
12,you can you can change {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,393
12,No .,Marketing,393
12,"Nah , but they just said we need it .",Industrial Designer,394
12,Okay .,Project Manager,395
12,"Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .",Industrial Designer,396
12,"Yeah , a recharger maybe .",Project Manager,397
12,"Yeah , we have to make sure to uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,398
12,Yeah okay .,Industrial Designer,399
12,"We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?",Project Manager,400
12,Yeah but {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,401
12,Is that still the {disfmarker},Project Manager,402
12,Yes .,User Interface,403
12,Yes .,User Interface,403
12,"Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an {disfmarker} How do you call it ?",Industrial Designer,404
12,Accu .,Industrial Designer,404
12,A recha Oh no .,Project Manager,405
12,Uh {disfmarker} Battery .,Project Manager,405
12,It's just a battery .,Project Manager,405
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,405
12,Re recharger .,User Interface,406
12,Base station .,User Interface,406
12,"Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .",Industrial Designer,407
12,"Yeah , batteries .",User Interface,408
12,"Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .",User Interface,408
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,409
12,Not a separate {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,409
12,"No , just rechargeable batteries .",Project Manager,410
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,411
12,"And uh a chip , that's this one .",Industrial Designer,411
12,{gap},Project Manager,412
12,Then uh I received some possibilities .,Industrial Designer,413
12,Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh {disfmarker} Like with the pulse watch .,Industrial Designer,413
12,So it operates on your wrist kinda .,Industrial Designer,413
12,Ah cool .,Marketing,414
12,Okay .,Marketing,414
12,But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .,Project Manager,415
12,"So if you hold it , it gets powered .",User Interface,416
12,If you hold it .,Industrial Designer,417
12,"Yeah , I don't think it will work , and {disfmarker} Or we can also use solar cells .",Industrial Designer,417
12,"But you mostly use it indoors ,",Industrial Designer,417
12,It's dark in the room .,Project Manager,418
12,No .,Project Manager,418
12,{gap},User Interface,419
12,"It's just batteries ,",Project Manager,420
12,so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,421
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,422
12,that's cheaper {gap} .,Project Manager,423
12,"Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .",Industrial Designer,424
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,425
12,"Um cases , flat , so uncurved .",Industrial Designer,426
12,Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back .,Industrial Designer,426
12,And three D_ curved is also in depth .,Industrial Designer,426
12,Okay .,Marketing,427
12,So that's possible .,Industrial Designer,428
12,"Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .",Industrial Designer,428
12,Mm .,User Interface,429
12,So,User Interface,429
12,So we can't use the flat buttons .,Industrial Designer,430
12,we need uh two D_ .,User Interface,431
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,432
12,Definitely .,Project Manager,432
12,"Yeah , I think .",Industrial Designer,433
12,Um these kinda materials can be used .,Industrial Designer,433
12,"But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .",Project Manager,434
12,Yeah .,User Interface,435
12,"Yeah , I think so too .",Industrial Designer,436
12,"The scroll wheels , that's cool .",Project Manager,437
12,That's for the volume .,Project Manager,437
12,"Yeah , scroll wheels um {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,438
12,Yeah .,User Interface,439
12,"Yeah , that's good .",Industrial Designer,440
12,"We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .",Industrial Designer,440
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,441
12,But I think just the volume is enough .,Industrial Designer,442
12,"{gap} Uh {disfmarker} For channels it's not handy ,",User Interface,443
12,Okay .,Project Manager,444
12,because you scroll too fast .,User Interface,445
12,And uh the L_C_D_ .,Industrial Designer,446
12,"So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .",Industrial Designer,446
12,Mm {disfmarker},Marketing,447
12,I don't think that's an opportunity .,Project Manager,448
12,Just skip it .,Project Manager,448
12,Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .,Project Manager,448
12,"Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip .",Industrial Designer,449
12,So th so the regular chip .,Industrial Designer,449
12,Because we use scroll wheels .,Industrial Designer,449
12,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,450
12,Okay .,User Interface,451
12,"And um {disfmarker} Yeah , that was it I guess .",Industrial Designer,452
12,Okay .,Project Manager,453
12,"Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,454
12,Oh just sk,Project Manager,455
12,We haven't decided yet .,Industrial Designer,456
12,Maybe you have to skip that one as well .,Project Manager,457
12,It's {disfmarker},Project Manager,457
12,Uh I don't think a rubber case looks {disfmarker},User Interface,458
12,L,Industrial Designer,459
12,Uh but we have to do something about the trend .,Marketing,460
12,"Yeah , i it it should be soft .",Industrial Designer,461
12,You said so ?,Industrial Designer,461
12,The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .,Marketing,462
12,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,463
12,"That {disfmarker} Uh fruit and veg , or {disfmarker}",User Interface,463
12,And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .,Marketing,464
12,"Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .",User Interface,465
12,Uh yeah i Just {disfmarker} Just on front .,Marketing,466
12,"So you can {gap} the the spongy {disfmarker} yeah , I dunno .",User Interface,467
12,I can't imagine a soft remote control .,User Interface,467
12,No .,Project Manager,468
12,Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .,Marketing,469
12,No .,Project Manager,470
12,{gap} {vocalsound},Project Manager,470
12,I just can't imagine it .,User Interface,471
12,{vocalsound} So just hard plastic ?,Industrial Designer,472
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,473
12,"Yeah , I think .",User Interface,474
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,475
12,Titanium .,User Interface,476
12,It's mentioned here uh .,User Interface,476
12,"Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .",Industrial Designer,477
12,But maybe the form has to be a bit different .,Project Manager,478
12,Not the sh the square form .,Project Manager,478
12,Just a bit,Project Manager,478
12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,479
12,more rounded .,Project Manager,480
12,you can make it curved or mm round .,Industrial Designer,481
12,"But just in two D_ , not in depth .",Industrial Designer,481
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,482
12,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,482
12,Okay .,User Interface,483
12,So {disfmarker} We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these .,Project Manager,484
12,What exactly .,Project Manager,484
12,Because we have to know it .,Project Manager,484
12,So the energy uh is the recharger .,Project Manager,484
12,{gap},User Interface,485
12,We already know that .,Project Manager,486
12,Just a normal battery .,Project Manager,486
12,Yeah .,User Interface,487
12,We have batteries .,User Interface,487
12,Okay .,Project Manager,488
12,The chip-on-print is a normal one .,Project Manager,488
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,489
12,Regular .,User Interface,490
12,"Okay , the case is just a plastic one .",Project Manager,491
12,"Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .",Industrial Designer,492
12,"Yeah , re Yeah , regular .",Project Manager,493
12,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,493
12,"Yeah , regular .",Project Manager,493
12,"You have the simple one , regular and advanced .",Industrial Designer,494
12,So it's b should be regular uh the second .,Industrial Designer,494
12,Okay .,Project Manager,495
12,I think I'll just check it .,Industrial Designer,496
12,"And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .",Project Manager,497
12,{gap},Project Manager,497
12,Yes .,User Interface,498
12,That's pretty much it .,Project Manager,499
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,500
12,And a flashy light .,Project Manager,501
12,User interface concept .,User Interface,502
12,So uh I'm not sure .,Project Manager,503
12,But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment .,Project Manager,503
12,But {gap},Project Manager,503
12,I dunno either .,User Interface,504
12,Mm .,Industrial Designer,505
12,Or should we do it in the next meeting ?,Industrial Designer,505
12,Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .,User Interface,506
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,507
12,That's for the next one .,Project Manager,507
12,So we should did it here ?,Industrial Designer,508
12,That's for th,Project Manager,509
12,So we're staying here ?,User Interface,510
12,Uh that {disfmarker} I think that's the next next meeting .,Project Manager,511
12,Or should we do it in the next meeting ?,Industrial Designer,512
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,512
12,But you definitely get a specific instruction .,Project Manager,513
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,513
12,"Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?",User Interface,514
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,515
12,But th think about something that's more rounded .,Project Manager,516
12,Just {disfmarker} And more {disfmarker} It has to be {disfmarker},Project Manager,516
12,"Yeah , uh I dunno .",User Interface,517
12,"But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .",User Interface,517
12,Uh a bit .,Project Manager,518
12,Just just on the top or on the bottom .,Project Manager,518
12,"Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .",User Interface,519
12,Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this .,Project Manager,520
12,"O um if you draw it like this , you get a {disfmarker} What the fuck is it ?",Project Manager,520
12,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,520
12,Mm {disfmarker} Doesn't work .,Project Manager,520
12,{vocalsound} You see what I mean ?,Project Manager,520
12,{vocalsound} What ?,Industrial Designer,521
12,If I draw here {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It draws about four centimetres lower than {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,522
12,Oh .,Industrial Designer,523
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,523
12,Nah okay .,Project Manager,524
12,Just {gap} .,Project Manager,524
12,Maybe you can make it like this .,Project Manager,524
12,And this is all the wheel for volume .,Project Manager,524
12,"So that you just um {disfmarker} It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .",Project Manager,524
12,Like a very big scroll-wheel .,Industrial Designer,525
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,525
12,"Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .",Project Manager,526
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,527
12,"Maybe , I dunno .",Project Manager,528
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,529
12,"Okay , so we {vocalsound} have this at the moment .",Project Manager,530
12,I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .,Industrial Designer,531
12,"Yeah , you {gap} {disfmarker}",User Interface,532
12,"Okay , so",Project Manager,533
12,Yeah .,User Interface,534
12,we'd have this .,Project Manager,535
12,Is that okay ?,Project Manager,535
12,"Yeah ,",User Interface,536
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,537
12,"that's a little problem , of course , as well .",User Interface,538
12,I think it's probably better .,Industrial Designer,539
12,And {disfmarker},Project Manager,540
12,"Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume .",Industrial Designer,541
12,Only if you use your finger .,Industrial Designer,541
12,"Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh {disfmarker} That's not scrollable too easy .",User Interface,542
12,Like this .,Project Manager,543
12,And uh what's the channel choose ?,Project Manager,543
12,Where do we uh put that ?,Project Manager,543
12,Still on the bottom,Project Manager,543
12,I think in middle .,Industrial Designer,544
12,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,545
12,Uh wh what is the middle part ?,User Interface,546
12,That's the numbers .,Project Manager,547
12,"Numbers , okay .",User Interface,548
12,"Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .",Industrial Designer,549
12,"Yeah , I agree as well .",User Interface,550
12,"It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .",Project Manager,551
12,Use the dz,User Interface,552
12,"Because you already have the volume here , so {disfmarker} You can also put it here one butt and the other one there .",Project Manager,553
12,Next to each other .,Project Manager,553
12,{gap} back and forth .,Project Manager,553
12,"Yeah , that's right .",User Interface,554
12,"So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty .",Project Manager,555
12,Because you have to hold it as well .,Project Manager,555
12,Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .,Industrial Designer,556
12,"But that's not {gap} want to zap very quick , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,557
12,"Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority .",User Interface,558
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,559
12,Yeah ?,Project Manager,560
12,"Is this a opportunity ,",Project Manager,560
12,And then you use those uh {disfmarker},User Interface,561
12,or you don't want a different {disfmarker},Project Manager,562
12,"Yeah , of course uh .",User Interface,563
12,"Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,564
12,Why ?,Project Manager,565
12,Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,566
12,But still the next {disfmarker} It's still the next one .,Project Manager,567
12,Doesn't make {disfmarker},Project Manager,567
12,"Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you put them {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,568
12,"Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same .",Project Manager,569
12,It ma it doesn't make a big difference .,Project Manager,569
12,Yeah .,User Interface,570
12,"I I think it's {disfmarker} It's it's obvious , I think .",User Interface,570
12,"But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .",Industrial Designer,571
12,"Yeah , that's not not {disfmarker} It's not al uh always the same .",Marketing,572
12,But it's exactly th,Project Manager,573
12,In uh {disfmarker} On most on most remote controls .,Industrial Designer,574
12,Every remote control's uh different .,Marketing,575
12,"Yeah , I think {disfmarker}",User Interface,576
12,"So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .",Industrial Designer,577
12,I dunno .,Project Manager,578
12,"I {disfmarker} You already have the volume on the side ,",Project Manager,578
12,"No , uh I think {disfmarker}",User Interface,579
12,so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake .,Project Manager,580
12,Yeah .,User Interface,581
12,So it's uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,582
12,I think it's s so simple,User Interface,583
12,I dunno .,Industrial Designer,584
12,you just {disfmarker},User Interface,585
12,"So but that's for that's for you ,",Project Manager,586
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,587
12,'cause it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,588
12,"Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .",User Interface,589
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,590
12,"Okay , so hmm .",Project Manager,591
12,What did {disfmarker} What else we have to discuss about ?,Project Manager,591
12,I dunno .,Project Manager,591
12,Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?,User Interface,592
12,"Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new .",Marketing,593
12,Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .,Marketing,593
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,594
12,'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .,Marketing,595
12,And the LED .,Project Manager,596
12,"No , you have uh {disfmarker} It is {disfmarker}",User Interface,597
12,"Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .",Industrial Designer,598
12,Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic .,User Interface,599
12,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,600
12,You have to look at that image of the iPod .,User Interface,601
12,Yes .,Marketing,602
12,Okay .,Marketing,602
12,More that uh kind of style .,User Interface,603
12,And a bit uh {disfmarker},Marketing,604
12,Not not the old grey black {disfmarker},User Interface,605
12,Uh {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,606
12,Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have {disfmarker},Marketing,607
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,608
12,Where you can put a ve Uh we have {disfmarker} If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .,User Interface,609
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,610
12,Uh the logo was has to be on there .,Project Manager,610
12,"Yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,610
12,Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ?,Marketing,611
12,Uh five or something ?,Marketing,611
12,"Yeah , five .",Project Manager,612
12,Let's give five .,Project Manager,612
12,{gap},User Interface,613
12,Or more or {disfmarker},Marketing,614
12,Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh {disfmarker},User Interface,615
12,And um uh {vocalsound} uh buy the product .,Marketing,616
12,"You buy , you get one .",Marketing,616
12,And uh basic .,Marketing,616
12,Yeah .,User Interface,617
12,Um,User Interface,617
12,Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .,Marketing,618
12,I think {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface,619
12,"That's your choice , I think huh .",User Interface,619
12,"No , tha that will be {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,620
12,So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ?,Project Manager,621
12,Is that is that a good good opportunity ?,Project Manager,621
12,Yes .,User Interface,622
12,"So you could put it like that ,",Project Manager,623
12,"Yeah , so top down .",Industrial Designer,624
12,okay .,Project Manager,625
12,Hmm ?,Industrial Designer,626
12,"Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .",Marketing,627
12,Do we have to design that w as well ?,Industrial Designer,628
12,Yeah .,Marketing,629
12,{vocalsound},Marketing,629
12,Uh I'm not sure .,Project Manager,630
12,The docking station ?,Industrial Designer,631
12,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,632
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,633
12,"But th Yeah , that can be very simple .",User Interface,634
12,Least .,User Interface,634
12,"Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .",Marketing,635
12,"Yeah , just a recharger .",Industrial Designer,636
12,"Yeah , just where you're around something .",User Interface,637
12,"Li Yeah , we had one example .",User Interface,637
12,But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .,Industrial Designer,638
12,Mm .,User Interface,639
12,Mm .,User Interface,639
12,"Yeah ,",Marketing,640
12,Which w,User Interface,641
12,but that's a round one .,Marketing,642
12,Maybe we can choose then .,Marketing,642
12,Here you see one that's very round .,User Interface,643
12,"Oh yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,644
12,So I think that can be all kind of shapes .,User Interface,645
12,But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .,Project Manager,646
12,That's all .,Project Manager,646
12,Of the remote control ?,Industrial Designer,647
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,648
12,Yeah .,Marketing,649
12,Yeah {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,650
12,Just round it up {gap} .,Project Manager,651
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,652
12,"Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod {gap} .",User Interface,653
12,But {disfmarker},User Interface,653
12,No .,Project Manager,654
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,654
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,654
12,More rounded .,User Interface,655
12,"Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one .",User Interface,655
12,Since it's {disfmarker} This is also rounded .,User Interface,655
12,"No , just just the corners .",Project Manager,656
12,I think i,User Interface,657
12,{gap},Marketing,658
12,"Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered .",User Interface,659
12,Mm {gap} {disfmarker},User Interface,659
12,Okay .,Project Manager,660
12,"Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh {disfmarker} As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .",Industrial Designer,661
12,Shapes .,Project Manager,662
12,"Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new .",User Interface,663
12,Not in depth .,Industrial Designer,664
12,"Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new .",Industrial Designer,664
12,I've uh {disfmarker} I had a lot of picture of old ones .,User Interface,665
12,And all curves have already been done .,User Interface,665
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,666
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,667
12,"It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?",Project Manager,668
12,Yeah .,Marketing,669
12,What do we do wrong ?,Marketing,669
12,Hmm .,Marketing,669
12,Just just more like this and not uh a square .,Marketing,669
12,"Yeah okay , yeah well {disfmarker}",User Interface,670
12,Okay .,Marketing,671
12,"Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .",Industrial Designer,672
12,I would do it {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,672
12,Yeah .,User Interface,673
12,"I know we can do a lot more , but {disfmarker}",User Interface,673
12,"Yeah , it {disfmarker}",Marketing,674
12,{vocalsound},Project Manager,675
12,Like in this kind of shape or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,676
12,Uh it's very annoying .,Marketing,677
12,Okay .,Marketing,677
12,I dunno .,Industrial Designer,678
12,I dunno if it's handy .,Industrial Designer,678
12,{gap} I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .,User Interface,679
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,680
12,This ?,Industrial Designer,681
12,Yeah .,User Interface,682
12,The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .,Industrial Designer,683
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,684
12,But uh I had a lot of pictures {disfmarker} Oh I can show you here {vocalsound} what the old ones look like .,User Interface,684
12,Mm .,Industrial Designer,685
12,"Curves , curves .",User Interface,686
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,687
12,You've more {gap} there as well .,User Interface,688
12,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,689
12,It wasn't very small one .,User Interface,690
12,{gap} very simple .,User Interface,690
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,691
12,That is for elderly .,User Interface,692
12,"So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .",Project Manager,693
12,"Yeah , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,694
12,Yeah .,Marketing,695
12,I think if w My opinion .,User Interface,696
12,"If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .",User Interface,696
12,Yeah .,Marketing,697
12,"So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours .",User Interface,698
12,And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .,User Interface,698
12,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,699
12,No rubber buttons or something .,User Interface,700
12,Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look .,User Interface,700
12,More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .,User Interface,700
12,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,701
12,And you have the scroll button inside .,Project Manager,702
12,{gap} Okay .,Project Manager,702
12,Yes .,User Interface,703
12,Just a simple scrollb,User Interface,703
12,Yeah .,Marketing,704
12,But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?,Project Manager,705
12,Of {disfmarker} Skip that one as well .,Project Manager,705
12,Doesn't have to be .,User Interface,706
12,Okay .,Project Manager,707
12,"Yeah , it's cool .",Project Manager,707
12,"Yeah , though that's a trend .",Industrial Designer,708
12,If we want to make it .,Industrial Designer,708
12,"But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are .",Industrial Designer,708
12,{vocalsound} So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,708
12,{vocalsound} Uh the t the trend is,Marketing,709
12,Rubber spongy .,Project Manager,710
12,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,711
12,spongy and fruity .,Marketing,712
12,Yeah .,User Interface,713
12,No .,User Interface,713
12,Spongy,User Interface,713
12,But yeah .,Marketing,714
12,Spongeball kinda .,Industrial Designer,715
12,and {disfmarker},User Interface,716
12,It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh {disfmarker},Marketing,717
12,"Okay , so we have s still one minute left .",Project Manager,718
12,So just {disfmarker},Project Manager,718
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,719
12,I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .,Project Manager,720
12,Mm .,User Interface,721
12,Okay .,Industrial Designer,722
12,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,722
12,It {disfmarker} The th th,Marketing,723
12,I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .,Industrial Designer,724
12,No .,Project Manager,725
12,Yeah .,Marketing,726
12,But I I think it's still for older people .,Project Manager,727
12,You j still have older people .,Project Manager,727
12,"It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever .",Project Manager,727
12,Just you have a normal {disfmarker},Project Manager,727
12,"Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .",Industrial Designer,728
12,"There is one {disfmarker} There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself .",Marketing,729
12,It must have uh uh uh a very different {disfmarker},Marketing,729
12,"Yeah , {gap} idea .",User Interface,730
12,But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker},User Interface,730
12,But i it is it is it is already fancy .,Project Manager,731
12,Because of the lights on the bottom of it .,Project Manager,731
12,That's already fancy .,Project Manager,731
12,And if you make it look like the iPod {disfmarker},User Interface,732
12,"Yeah , they're all the same .",Marketing,733
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,734
12,So that's already a very big change,User Interface,734
12,Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the {vocalsound} wha what's it called uh scroll wheel .,Project Manager,735
12,Make it in in yellow or something .,Project Manager,735
12,Just like the colours of Real Reaction .,Project Manager,735
12,compared to {disfmarker},User Interface,736
12,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,737
12,Ye yeah .,User Interface,738
12,Well uh {disfmarker},User Interface,738
12,"Yeah , we could do that .",Industrial Designer,739
12,Could .,User Interface,740
12,"Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow .",Marketing,741
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,742
12,"No , I think {disfmarker} Oh .",User Interface,743
12,It's right .,Project Manager,744
12,Think the scroll wheel {vocalsound} won't be very big .,User Interface,745
12,"Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .",User Interface,745
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,746
12,So it will just be a small small scroll wheel .,User Interface,747
12,So it won't uh stick out much .,User Interface,747
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,748
12,Maybe the ones we are going to draw there .,Project Manager,748
12,Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has {vocalsound} if it can work better than this .,Project Manager,748
12,Because it doesn't work properly .,Project Manager,748
12,So maybe you have to ask her .,Project Manager,748
12,Yeah okay .,User Interface,749
12,"Well ,",User Interface,749
12,No .,Marketing,750
12,"maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .",User Interface,751
12,Okay .,Project Manager,752
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,752
12,That's probably {disfmarker},Project Manager,752
12,I'll be able to do a better job .,User Interface,753
12,"If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here .",Marketing,754
12,Doesn't work .,Marketing,754
12,"{vocalsound} Okay , so just finish it .",Project Manager,755
12,So we make it a bit like m that one probably .,Project Manager,755
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,755
12,Is that okay ?,Project Manager,755
12,"Yeah , I'll see it .",Marketing,756
12,"Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod {gap} .",User Interface,757
12,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,758
12,"Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,759
12,Yes .,User Interface,760
12,We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .,Project Manager,761
12,Just a {disfmarker} Speech .,User Interface,762
12,"Yeah , do we s keep that ?",User Interface,762
12,"Yeah , I think {disfmarker}",User Interface,762
12,Or keep that ?,Project Manager,763
12,It's okay .,Project Manager,763
12,But you'd definitely need a,Project Manager,763
12,S {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,764
12,Well uh,User Interface,765
12,advanced chip .,Project Manager,766
12,then it w {vocalsound},User Interface,767
12,"Uh yeah , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,768
12,"Yeah , I think so .",Industrial Designer,768
12,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,769
12,And we we have to build in a microphone and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,770
12,Well that's very easy .,User Interface,771
12,"We already have uh the beeping of the {gap} home station ,",User Interface,771
12,"Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that .",Industrial Designer,772
12,so {disfmarker},User Interface,773
12,"I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition ,",Industrial Designer,774
12,No .,Marketing,775
12,Uh strange that I received {vocalsound} the information about that .,User Interface,776
12,so {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,777
12,Oh that's hard .,Marketing,778
12,But {disfmarker},Marketing,778
12,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,779
12,Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said .,Marketing,780
12,We have to be original and uh technological innovative .,Marketing,780
12,Becau,Marketing,780
12,"Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,",Project Manager,781
12,Yeah .,Marketing,782
12,But {disfmarker},Marketing,782
12,okay ?,Project Manager,783
12,So,User Interface,784
12,{vocalsound} Ma,Marketing,785
12,shall we {gap} it open then ?,User Interface,786
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,787
12,So we can put all the {disfmarker},User Interface,788
12,The function of that in there .,Project Manager,789
12,Yeah .,Project Manager,789
12,Okay .,User Interface,790
12,And we need a {disfmarker} Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .,Project Manager,791
12,Fine .,Industrial Designer,792
12,"Yeah , we probably do .",Industrial Designer,792
12,"But it doesn't say anything about it ,",Project Manager,793
12,Yeah .,User Interface,794
12,does it ?,Project Manager,795
12,No .,Industrial Designer,796
12,"Oh yeah , I {disfmarker}",User Interface,797
12,But we don't have any f information about the cost .,Marketing,798
12,No .,User Interface,799
12,We started with information about the cost was now th,Marketing,800
12,I just I just received the {disfmarker},User Interface,801
12,"Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost .",Industrial Designer,802
12,But just a about the chip .,Industrial Designer,802
12,Yeah .,User Interface,803
12,And how much is the chip ?,Marketing,804
12,The the the {disfmarker},Marketing,804
12,"I don't know how much , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,805
12,"Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .",User Interface,806
12,Just in inexpensive or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,807
12,"This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .",User Interface,808
12,And how how does it work ?,Marketing,809
12,Is it {disfmarker},Marketing,809
12,Doesn't say .,User Interface,810
12,"Just {disfmarker} You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample .",User Interface,810
12,"Because uh {disfmarker} So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .",User Interface,810
12,It doesn't has to say anything .,Project Manager,811
12,Just {disfmarker} You have to just talk to {disfmarker},Project Manager,811

12,Does it say does it say something back ?,Marketing,814
12,"Okay , we have to stop it now .",Project Manager,815
12,So just {disfmarker},Project Manager,815
12,No .,User Interface,816
12,"Yeah , it {disfmarker} Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .",User Interface,816
12,"Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced {disfmarker}",Project Manager,817
12,But i it's a separate chip .,Industrial Designer,818
12,"I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .",User Interface,819
12,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,820
12,{vocalsound} Okay .,Marketing,821
12,"Yeah , I don't know anything about this ,",Industrial Designer,822
12,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,823
12,"Yeah , we just decide not to put it in ,",Project Manager,824
12,but {disfmarker} Nah .,Industrial Designer,825
12,because it's too difficult .,Project Manager,826

13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,44
13,{vocalsound} No problem .,Project Manager,45
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,46
13,"Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control .",Project Manager,47
13,"Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .",Project Manager,47
13,"Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .",Project Manager,47
13,{vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .,Project Manager,47
13,Okay .,User Interface,48
13,"The market , we should have a look at the market .",Project Manager,49
13,"Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages .",Project Manager,49
13,"Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker} the the progressions , yes .",Project Manager,49
13,Progressions .,User Interface,50
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,50
13,"Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific {disfmarker} uh specification of that .",Project Manager,51
13,"Um {vocalsound} the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ?",Project Manager,51
13,Well in this case control t the the television I think .,Project Manager,51
13,It's for the vision .,User Interface,52
13,Yeah .,User Interface,52
13,Um and the last one is the working design .,Project Manager,53
13,How exactly does it work in the technical sense .,Project Manager,53
13,"Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later .",Project Manager,53
13,So we'll kop it {disfmarker} keep it with the functional design .,Project Manager,53
13,"{vocalsound} Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .",Project Manager,53
13,Um as you see now I can give a presentation .,Project Manager,53
13,{vocalsound} Um it's also possible to use this one as well .,Project Manager,53
13,You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .,Project Manager,53
13,"Um {vocalsound} to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .",Project Manager,53
13,Um then we have this electronic white-board system .,Project Manager,53
13,"{vocalsound} Um yeah , I will show that now .",Project Manager,53
13,Um you can draw on the board using this pen .,Project Manager,53
13,There are little um uh,Project Manager,53
13,Sensors .,User Interface,54
13,"sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end .",Project Manager,55
13,"Um well , it {disfmarker} it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button .",Project Manager,55
13,"Okay , so not too fast writing .",Project Manager,55
13,Um {vocalsound} you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .,Project Manager,55
13,It's quite the same .,Project Manager,55
13,Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file .,Project Manager,55
13,So do not m make a new file .,Project Manager,55
13,Just use this one uh during the day .,Project Manager,55
13,{vocalsound} Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .,Project Manager,55
13,But we all use the same white-board file,User Interface,56
13,Yes .,Project Manager,57
13,So we can work together on it while we're {disfmarker},User Interface,58
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,59
13,or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?,User Interface,60
13,"Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .",Project Manager,61
13,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,62
13,It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard .,Project Manager,63
13,"Yeah , alright .",User Interface,64
13,Yep .,User Interface,64
13,"Um you can choose the format , um {disfmarker} sorry .",Project Manager,65
13,Uh {disfmarker} Let me see .,Project Manager,65
13,Um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected .,Project Manager,65
13,Yep .,Project Manager,65
13,"Current colour , you can choose another colour .",Project Manager,65
13,"And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width .",Project Manager,65
13,Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour .,Project Manager,65
13,Okay .,Project Manager,65
13,"Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me .",Project Manager,65
13,"Um {vocalsound} to um {disfmarker} oh well , I'm {disfmarker} I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us .",Project Manager,65
13,Um as a little training {vocalsound} um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .,Project Manager,65
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,65
13,Okay .,Marketing,66
13,Um green .,Marketing,66
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,67
13,An animal .,Marketing,68
13,Okay .,Marketing,68
13,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,68
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,69
13,Uh a wee rabbit .,Marketing,70
13,It's a bunny .,User Interface,71
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,71
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,72
13,A rabbit .,Project Manager,73
13,"Okay , well great .",Project Manager,73
13,Alright .,Industrial Designer,74
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,75
13,"Um Roo , could you do the same please ?",Project Manager,76
13,But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .,Project Manager,76
13,"But of course , Flores .",User Interface,77
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,78
13,Blank .,User Interface,79
13,Sebastian is thinking about the animal .,Project Manager,80
13,I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal .,Industrial Designer,81
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,81
13,Okay .,Project Manager,82
13,"Yeah , I'm think about it too .",User Interface,83
13,{vocalsound} Format {gap} .,User Interface,83
13,"Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but {vocalsound} it works ,",User Interface,83
13,"{vocalsound} Well , I'll give it a try .",Industrial Designer,84
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,84
13,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,85
13,It it should be a cat .,Project Manager,86
13,right ?,User Interface,87
13,Okay ?,Project Manager,88
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,89
13,{vocalsound} Mm .,Industrial Designer,90
13,{vocalsound} I'm guessing a horse .,Project Manager,91
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,92
13,Very good .,Industrial Designer,93
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,93
13,With a very small {vocalsound} legs .,User Interface,94
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,94
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,95
13,{vocalsound} I was very good in drawing .,Industrial Designer,96
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,96
13,You should feed that uh that animal .,User Interface,97
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,97
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,98
13,"{vocalsound} Well , I guess you uh get the idea .",Industrial Designer,99
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,99
13,"Yes , okay .",Project Manager,100
13,{vocalsound} Beautiful .,Project Manager,100
13,Beautiful .,Industrial Designer,101
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,102
13,"Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .",Project Manager,103
13,"Um any questions {disfmarker} well , just just let me know .",Project Manager,103
13,"Um okay , back to our project .",Project Manager,103
13,Um {vocalsound} the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .,Project Manager,103
13,"Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number .",Project Manager,103
13,{vocalsound} Um,Project Manager,103
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,104
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,105
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,106
13,"we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country .",Project Manager,107
13,"And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , {vocalsound} um because uh , well , those are important numbers .",Project Manager,107
13,"Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .",Project Manager,107
13,"Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh",Industrial Designer,108
13,Limitations .,Project Manager,109
13,influations influences .,Industrial Designer,110
13,Okay .,Project Manager,111
13,Okay .,User Interface,112
13,"Okay , great .",Project Manager,113
13,Okay ?,Industrial Designer,114
13,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,114
13,"Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer .",Industrial Designer,114
13,"I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .",Industrial Designer,114
13,"So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities .",Industrial Designer,114
13,So that's one .,Industrial Designer,114
13,"{vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same .",Industrial Designer,114
13,Sorry about that .,Industrial Designer,114
13,Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .,Industrial Designer,114
13,Okay .,User Interface,115
13,I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion .,Industrial Designer,116
13,One thing about uh interopera operability .,Industrial Designer,116
13,Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment .,Industrial Designer,116
13,"Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .",Industrial Designer,116
13,So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .,Industrial Designer,116
13,And for a cell phone ?,User Interface,117
13,"Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .",Industrial Designer,118
13,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,119
13,Yeah .,User Interface,119
13,I think it could come in handy .,Industrial Designer,120
13,We should discuss that .,Industrial Designer,120
13,Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .,Industrial Designer,120
13,"We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh",Industrial Designer,120
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,121
13,is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore .,Industrial Designer,122
13,But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .,Industrial Designer,122
13,"But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .",User Interface,123
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,124
13,"But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so",User Interface,125
13,But it's cost-effective .,Industrial Designer,126
13,Yes .,Industrial Designer,126
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,126
13,"Well , not all , not all .",Industrial Designer,126
13,y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .,User Interface,127
13,So that's the point .,Industrial Designer,128
13,Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker},User Interface,129
13,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,130
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,131
13,you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .,User Interface,132
13,"Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss",Industrial Designer,133
13,Yeah .,User Interface,134
13,and uh about every everybody should think about it .,Industrial Designer,135
13,"So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,",Industrial Designer,135
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,136
13,but take these things into account when you start the discussion .,Industrial Designer,137
13,"Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,",Project Manager,138
13,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer,139
13,and {disfmarker},Project Manager,140
13,"so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,",Industrial Designer,141
13,"Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,142
13,and the way of communicating with these equipments .,Industrial Designer,143
13,Okay .,Project Manager,144
13,"Okay , good .",Project Manager,144
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,145
13,Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ?,Project Manager,146
13,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager,146
13,That's it .,Industrial Designer,147
13,Um {vocalsound} okay .,Project Manager,148
13,Great .,Project Manager,148
13,Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation .,Project Manager,148
13,Um {disfmarker} Mm .,Project Manager,148
13,Okay .,Project Manager,148
13,Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .,Project Manager,148
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,149
13,Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .,Project Manager,150
13,"Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role .",Project Manager,150
13,"Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part .",Project Manager,150
13,Um so let's start with you .,Project Manager,150
13,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,151
13,H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?,Project Manager,152
13,"Well , I had a few uh things in mind .",User Interface,153
13,"Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?",User Interface,153
13,Yep .,Project Manager,154
13,{vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .,User Interface,155
13,"Yes , I think it should be something like that .",Industrial Designer,156
13,"It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,",User Interface,157
13,"Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,",Project Manager,158
13,right ?,User Interface,159
13,not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker},Project Manager,160
13,"Yeah , I do I don't know that .",User Interface,161
13,It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .,User Interface,161
13,"We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?",Industrial Designer,162
13,No .,Project Manager,163
13,No .,Project Manager,163
13,"No ,",Industrial Designer,164
13,"No , okay .",User Interface,165
13,"we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .",Industrial Designer,166
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,167
13,Yeah .,User Interface,168
13,"Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?",Project Manager,169
13,"Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .",Marketing,170
13,Okay .,Project Manager,171
13,Okay .,Project Manager,171
13,"{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ .",User Interface,172
13,That's just the basic f technical function .,User Interface,172
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,173
13,So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session .,User Interface,174
13,Um {disfmarker},User Interface,174
13,So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker},Project Manager,175
13,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,176
13,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,176
13,"Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .",User Interface,177
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,178
13,It just should change the T_V_'s state .,User Interface,179
13,Okay .,Project Manager,180
13,So that's it .,User Interface,181
13,Um but furthermore {disfmarker},User Interface,181
13,And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?,Industrial Designer,182
13,Yeah .,User Interface,183
13,"Yeah , with buttons .",User Interface,183
13,Or are there any o other controls ?,Industrial Designer,184
13,"Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}",User Interface,185
13,"Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,186
13,But {disfmarker},User Interface,187
13,"I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .",Industrial Designer,188
13,Yeah .,User Interface,189
13,Uh-huh .,Project Manager,190
13,You know these things .,Industrial Designer,191
13,And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,191
13,They're very vu vulnerable .,User Interface,192
13,"w yes ,",Industrial Designer,193
13,Yeah .,User Interface,194
13,"to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .",Industrial Designer,195
13,"So maybe that's an idea ,",Industrial Designer,195
13,Yeah .,User Interface,196
13,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,197
13,"And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing .",User Interface,198
13,"Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,",User Interface,198
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,199
13,"so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}",User Interface,200
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,201
13,Maybe not even pointed .,Project Manager,202
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,202
13,"Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .",User Interface,203
13,Okay,Project Manager,204
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,205
13,{disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,206
13,"Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?",Industrial Designer,207
13,So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .,Industrial Designer,207
13,"Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah .",User Interface,208
13,"For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,",User Interface,208
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,209
13,"but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}",User Interface,210
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,211
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,211
13,"Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting",Project Manager,212
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,213
13,But {disfmarker} Yeah .,User Interface,214
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,215
13,um {disfmarker},Project Manager,216
13,Two more things .,User Interface,217
13,okay .,Project Manager,218
13,"Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .",User Interface,219
13,"Okay , s yeah .",Project Manager,220
13,"You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .",User Interface,221
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,222
13,"And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too .",User Interface,223
13,Okay .,Project Manager,224
13,So when it's dark {disfmarker},User Interface,225
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,226
13,Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker},User Interface,227
13,Uh I'll write down glow in the dark .,Project Manager,228
13,Is tha {vocalsound},Project Manager,228
13,Yeah .,User Interface,229
13,{gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect .,User Interface,229
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,229
13,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,230
13,Okay .,Project Manager,231
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,232
13,"Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .",Project Manager,233
13,Do do you {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,234
13,Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ?,Project Manager,235
13,Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?,Project Manager,235
13,"Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .",Marketing,236
13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,237
13,"And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .",Marketing,238
13,Because ?,Project Manager,239
13,"Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .",Marketing,240
13,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,241
13,But uh lots of devices already use infrared .,Marketing,242
13,So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that .,Marketing,242
13,Okay .,Project Manager,243
13,Okay .,Project Manager,243
13,"Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?",Project Manager,243
13,"Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,",Industrial Designer,244
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,245
13,{vocalsound},User Interface,246
13,but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them .,Industrial Designer,247
13,"Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember .",Industrial Designer,247
13,Um you said something about visibility in the dark .,Industrial Designer,247
13,Yeah .,User Interface,248
13,"Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?",Industrial Designer,249
13,Which makes it easier to operate it .,Industrial Designer,249
13,Yeah .,User Interface,250
13,"Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple ,",User Interface,250
13,I I don't know .,Industrial Designer,251
13,you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .,User Interface,252
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,253
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,253
13,The uh the the digits in black .,User Interface,254
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,255
13,Uh then it's already visible in dark .,User Interface,256
13,So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy,User Interface,256
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,257
13,{vocalsound},Project Manager,258
13,"{disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course .",User Interface,259
13,Okay .,Project Manager,260
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,261
13,"Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product .",Project Manager,262
13,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,262
13,"Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .",Industrial Designer,263
13,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,264
13,"Well , that's more {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,265
13,"twelve Euro fifty , yeah .",Project Manager,266
13,Yeah .,Marketing,267
13,"So that's a big problem , I think .",Industrial Designer,268
13,I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .,Industrial Designer,268
13,Okay .,Project Manager,269
13,The cost price is very low .,Industrial Designer,270
13,Just remind something .,User Interface,271
13,Um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,272
13,The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .,User Interface,273
13,"Okay , okay .",Project Manager,274
13,You have a m uh {disfmarker},User Interface,275
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,276
13,Very good point .,Industrial Designer,276
13,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,276
13,"Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it .",User Interface,277
13,The marks .,User Interface,277
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,278
13,"Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now .",Project Manager,279
13,Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily,Project Manager,279
13,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,280
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,280
13,um or it should not consume too much um power .,Project Manager,281
13,Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .,Project Manager,281
13,Yeah .,User Interface,282
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,283
13,{vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker},Project Manager,284
13,"But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah .",User Interface,285
13,yeah .,Project Manager,286
13,"I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,286
13,Yeah .,User Interface,287
13,But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .,User Interface,287
13,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,288
13,'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker},User Interface,289
13,{vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,290
13,Well does it ?,Project Manager,291
13,"Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .",User Interface,292
13,well {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,293
13,I'm not sure .,Project Manager,294
13,Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,294
13,"Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay .",Industrial Designer,295
13,Yeah .,Project Manager,296
13,So uh technically it will be possible .,Industrial Designer,297
13,"But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .",User Interface,298
13,Okay .,Project Manager,299
13,"Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .",Project Manager,299
13,Does it {disfmarker},User Interface,300
13,"No , you cannot .",Industrial Designer,301
13,{vocalsound} It's over ?,User Interface,302
13,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,303
13,{vocalsound},Marketing,304
13,Um,Project Manager,305
13,Okay .,Industrial Designer,306
13,{vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work .,Project Manager,307
13,"Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .",Project Manager,307
13,Um so this was it .,Project Manager,307
13,Okay .,User Interface,308
13,See you in thirty minutes .,Project Manager,309
13,Great .,User Interface,310
14,Welcome back .,Project Manager,1
14,Hello .,User Interface,2
14,Hello .,Marketing,3
14,Uh let me see .,Project Manager,4
14,There's one of mine .,User Interface,5
14,Okay .,Project Manager,6
14,"Roo , welcome back .",Project Manager,6
14,"Hello , Flores .",User Interface,7
14,The waiting is for Sebastian .,Project Manager,8
14,{gap} .,User Interface,9
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,10
14,There he is .,Project Manager,11
14,{vocalsound} Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer,12
14,We have a slight problem .,User Interface,13
14,{vocalsound} I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .,User Interface,13
14,Sorry ?,Project Manager,14
14,{vocalsound} Can I get a cup of coffee ?,Industrial Designer,15
14,Uh no .,Project Manager,16
14,"You can't ,",Project Manager,16
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,17
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,17
14,sorry .,Project Manager,18
14,So just cancel it .,User Interface,19
14,"{gap} Well , during my work I have no time either .",Industrial Designer,20
14,"{vocalsound} Well ,",Project Manager,21
14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,22
14,this is life .,Project Manager,23
14,"{vocalsound} Sorry uh , Roo .",Project Manager,23
14,"Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box .",User Interface,24
14,{vocalsound} Accidentally .,User Interface,24
14,Okay .,Project Manager,25
14,Okay .,Project Manager,25
14,"People , welcome back with the second meeting .",Project Manager,25
14,But it's alright .,User Interface,26
14,{vocalsound} Um for now on the schedule are a few points .,Project Manager,27
14,"Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now .",Project Manager,27
14,"Um second , I received um some new project requirements .",Project Manager,27
14,"I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it .",Project Manager,27
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,28
14,"Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ?",Project Manager,29
14,Sebastian ?,Project Manager,29
14,I think so too .,Industrial Designer,30
14,Roo ?,Project Manager,31
14,Yeah .,User Interface,32
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,32
14,Ruud ?,Project Manager,33
14,Almost .,Marketing,34
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,34
14,"Almost , okay .",Project Manager,35
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,36
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,37
14,Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last .,Project Manager,38
14,Um the top goal of this m,Project Manager,38
14,"But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .",User Interface,39
14,{vocalsound} Um we will figure that out .,Project Manager,40
14,Ca {vocalsound} can you try to {disfmarker},Project Manager,40
14,Okay .,User Interface,41
14,Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the {gap} .,Marketing,42
14,"Yeah , w we will see .",Project Manager,43
14,I don't think it's wireless here .,User Interface,44
14,"Um {disfmarker} it is , yeah .",Project Manager,45
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,45
14,It is .,Industrial Designer,46
14,Or it is .,User Interface,47
14,Yeah ?,User Interface,47
14,It is .,Industrial Designer,48
14,"Okay , great .",User Interface,49
14,Uh okay .,Marketing,50
14,"Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .",Project Manager,51
14,Um {vocalsound} we have forty minutes .,Project Manager,51
14,So it's now {disfmarker} Yep .,Project Manager,51
14,Okay .,Project Manager,51
14,"Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .",Project Manager,51
14,So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .,Project Manager,51
14,{vocalsound} It's a board decision .,Project Manager,51
14,"Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w",Project Manager,51
14,Yeah .,User Interface,52
14,uh uh {disfmarker} we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .,Project Manager,53
14,"Time , yeah .",User Interface,54
14,"Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , {vocalsound} which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo .",Project Manager,55
14,Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty .,Project Manager,55
14,"Um {vocalsound} then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .",Project Manager,55
14,So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .,Project Manager,55
14,Yes .,User Interface,56
14,Is that clear ?,Project Manager,57
14,Any questions on these requirements ?,Project Manager,57
14,No ?,Project Manager,57
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,57
14,"Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?",Project Manager,57
14,"Yeah , I'll start .",User Interface,58
14,Uh uh yeah .,Project Manager,59
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,59
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,60
14,great .,Project Manager,61
14,"Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show .",User Interface,62
14,Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .,User Interface,62
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,63
14,Uh yes .,User Interface,64
14,Alright .,User Interface,64
14,Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .,User Interface,64
14,{vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .,User Interface,64
14,So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .,User Interface,64
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,65
14,"Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .",User Interface,66
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,67
14,And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .,User Interface,68
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,69
14,{vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,70
14,"My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design .",User Interface,70
14,But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .,User Interface,70
14,Uh-huh .,Project Manager,71
14,So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design .,User Interface,72
14,"But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design .",User Interface,72
14,"So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so .",User Interface,72
14,"But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .",User Interface,72
14,Okay .,Project Manager,73
14,"Uh Ruud , did you get that ?",Project Manager,73
14,Yeah .,User Interface,74
14,"Yeah , uh b uh most .",Marketing,75
14,"Okay , so",Project Manager,76
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,77
14,the important thing here is {disfmarker},Project Manager,78
14,{vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .,User Interface,79
14,"Oh , user-friendly .",Marketing,80
14,"In the market , yeah .",Project Manager,81
14,"Yeah , what what does the market want ?",User Interface,82
14,I I don't know .,User Interface,82
14,"Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,83
14,Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .,User Interface,84
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,85
14,Okay .,Project Manager,85
14,Sebastian .,Project Manager,85
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,86
14,{vocalsound} Excuse me .,Industrial Designer,86
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,86
14,{vocalsound} Scusi .,User Interface,87
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,87
14,"Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing .",Industrial Designer,88
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,88
14,"Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .",Industrial Designer,88
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,89
14,Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set .,Industrial Designer,90
14,And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set .,Industrial Designer,90
14,"Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,",Industrial Designer,90
14,Energies and uh {disfmarker},User Interface,91
14,but it's hardly readable .,Industrial Designer,92
14,Can you see it ?,Industrial Designer,92
14,"No , it's not visible .",Project Manager,93
14,No ?,Industrial Designer,94
14,"Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here .",Industrial Designer,94
14,{vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things .,Industrial Designer,94
14,"The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .",Industrial Designer,94
14,That's basically the idea .,Industrial Designer,94
14,"And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .",Industrial Designer,94
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,94
14,Um what have I found .,Industrial Designer,94
14,"Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .",Industrial Designer,94
14,That's all .,Industrial Designer,94
14,"It's cased together , nothing more than that .",Industrial Designer,94
14,{vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .,Industrial Designer,94
14,Yeah .,User Interface,95
14,"There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls .",Industrial Designer,96
14,And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons .,Industrial Designer,96
14,And I think that's what we w,Industrial Designer,96
14,The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .,User Interface,97
14,yes .,Industrial Designer,98
14,In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also .,Industrial Designer,98
14,So maybe we should consider that .,Industrial Designer,98
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,98
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,99
14,Okay .,Project Manager,99
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,100
14,I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented .,Industrial Designer,100
14,Um basically this is all there is .,Industrial Designer,100
14,There's just one chip .,Industrial Designer,100
14,There are a few buttons connected .,Industrial Designer,100
14,Uh the buttons are lit .,Industrial Designer,100
14,"And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .",Industrial Designer,100
14,{vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .,Industrial Designer,100
14,So it's fairly easy .,Project Manager,101
14,There's nothing more to it .,Industrial Designer,102
14,It's fairly easy .,Industrial Designer,102
14,"It's been done many times before ,",Industrial Designer,102
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,103
14,{vocalsound} Succeed in it also .,User Interface,104
14,and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .,Industrial Designer,105
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,106
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,107
14,"So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh",Industrial Designer,108
14,good .,Project Manager,109
14,"personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set .",Industrial Designer,110
14,So I think that uh should be clear .,Industrial Designer,110
14,Okay .,Project Manager,111
14,"Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components .",Industrial Designer,112
14,Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components .,Industrial Designer,112
14,"And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .",Industrial Designer,112
14,"{vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .",Industrial Designer,112
14,Okay .,Project Manager,113
14,"And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .",Industrial Designer,114
14,{vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker},User Interface,115
14,I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .,Industrial Designer,116
14,"if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}",User Interface,117
14,"No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .",Industrial Designer,118
14,Okay .,User Interface,119
14,So we can use them .,Industrial Designer,120
14,So that's no problem .,Industrial Designer,120
14,"For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker}",User Interface,121
14,"Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,122
14,Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker},User Interface,123
14,We can we can make its I think .,Industrial Designer,124
14,Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most .,Marketing,125
14,"So , the channel switching .",Marketing,125
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,126
14,Yeah .,User Interface,127
14,"Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .",Project Manager,128
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing,129
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,130
14,But I think {disfmarker},User Interface,131
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,132
14,"Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,",User Interface,133
14,"Hmm , true .",Marketing,134
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,134
14,and not for {disfmarker},User Interface,135
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,136
14,"Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .",Industrial Designer,136
14,"Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .",User Interface,137
14,"No no no , no .",Industrial Designer,138
14,"That's right , that's right .",Industrial Designer,138
14,Okay .,Project Manager,139
14,"So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it .",Industrial Designer,140
14,Okay .,Project Manager,141
14,{vocalsound} Um have a think about it .,Industrial Designer,142
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,143
14,"Okay , Ruud .",Project Manager,143
14,"Oh , mine is already outdated .",Marketing,144
14,"Okay well ,",Project Manager,145
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,146
14,we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .,Project Manager,147
14,{vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker},Marketing,148
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,149
14,So any income is welcome .,Project Manager,150
14,{vocalsound} Input .,Project Manager,150
14,"Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .",Marketing,151
14,Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .,Marketing,151
14,Okay .,Project Manager,152
14,Could you step a little bit more to the right ?,User Interface,153
14,"{vocalsound} Yeah , thank you .",User Interface,153
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,153
14,"But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market .",Marketing,154
14,"But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .",Marketing,154
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,155
14,"Uh well , skip this .",Marketing,156
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,156
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,157
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,157
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,158
14,"Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course .",Marketing,159
14,That they only use ten percent the buttons .,Marketing,159
14,"The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time .",Marketing,159
14,And the volume button's only four times .,Marketing,159
14,So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons .,Marketing,159
14,And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .,Marketing,159
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer,160
14,So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .,Marketing,161
14,Some uh audio signal .,Marketing,161
14,Like uh home phones .,Marketing,161
14,Okay .,Project Manager,162
14,"Well , that's interesting .",Project Manager,162
14,Or {disfmarker},Marketing,163
14,"Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function ,",Industrial Designer,164
14,Yeah .,User Interface,165
14,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,166
14,you know .,Industrial Designer,167
14,that's definitely interesting .,Project Manager,168
14,That's quite a {disfmarker} yes .,Industrial Designer,169
14,It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .,Project Manager,170
14,Sound signal .,User Interface,171
14,Yeah .,Marketing,172
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,173
14,Yeah .,User Interface,174
14,go on .,Project Manager,175
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,176
14,"Well , I just said that .",Marketing,177
14,"And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it .",Marketing,177
14,Okay .,Project Manager,178
14,So that's what the market tells us .,Project Manager,178
14,"Uh that's about it , yes .",Marketing,179
14,Yep .,Project Manager,180
14,Okay .,Project Manager,180
14,The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .,User Interface,181
14,Uh mo uh zap buttons most .,Marketing,182
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface,183
14,"Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot .",Marketing,184
14,But more than all the other buttons .,Marketing,184
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,184
14,"Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons .",User Interface,185
14,And first um {disfmarker},User Interface,185
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,186
14,"Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .",Industrial Designer,186
14,Yeah .,User Interface,187
14,Yep .,Project Manager,188
14,"Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties .",Industrial Designer,189
14,There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment .,Industrial Designer,189
14,So um I don't think we have any hiccups there .,Industrial Designer,189
14,So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs .,Industrial Designer,189
14,So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .,Industrial Designer,189
14,"Yeah , the sound signal .",User Interface,190
14,"Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?",User Interface,190
14,Well,Industrial Designer,191
14,"Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem .",Marketing,192
14,Yeah .,Marketing,192
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,192
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,193
14,{vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem .,Industrial Designer,193
14,{vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .,User Interface,194
14,Well,Project Manager,195
14,Usually {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,196
14,"maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",Project Manager,197
14,It should be uh uh {disfmarker},User Interface,198
14,like um turning on and off the the the lights .,Project Manager,199
14,Oh yes .,Industrial Designer,200
14,"Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .",User Interface,201
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,202
14,"Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already .",Industrial Designer,202
14,"Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button .",Industrial Designer,202
14,"You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .",Industrial Designer,202
14,Reports rep respend response to it .,Project Manager,203
14,And um {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,204
14,"just like uh the phones Yeah ,",User Interface,205
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,206
14,"Yes , that's it .",Industrial Designer,206
14,"Yes , same thing .",Industrial Designer,206
14,the {disfmarker},User Interface,207
14,Yeah .,Marketing,208
14,But uh th,Project Manager,209
14,But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons .,User Interface,210
14,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,210
14,"No , so we we should use something else .",Industrial Designer,211
14,And you {disfmarker},Marketing,212
14,"Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,213
14,But I believe you will have an {disfmarker},User Interface,214
14,"Yeah , and usually {disfmarker}",Marketing,215
14,We do not control the T_V_ set so well .,Industrial Designer,216
14,"And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,",Marketing,217
14,"Yes , m yes .",Industrial Designer,218
14,"S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers ,",Industrial Designer,218
14,and it's {disfmarker},Marketing,219
14,Okay .,Project Manager,220
14,so we should think about {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,221
14,So what about the clapping technique ?,Project Manager,222
14,Um because you se,Project Manager,222
14,I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .,User Interface,223
14,{vocalsound} It's quite complicated .,Industrial Designer,224
14,"Well , it's quite complicated .",Industrial Designer,224
14,Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .,Industrial Designer,224
14,{vocalsound} And b,Marketing,225
14,"Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,226
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,227
14,"Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,",Industrial Designer,227
14,"Yeah , a peak .",Project Manager,228
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,228
14,which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .,Industrial Designer,229
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,230
14,But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .,Industrial Designer,231
14,"So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .",Marketing,232
14,"Yeah , that's true .",Project Manager,233
14,"Yes ,",Industrial Designer,234
14,But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ .,User Interface,235
14,Just a little antenna or uh something .,User Interface,235
14,so we don't want that .,Industrial Designer,236
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,237
14,Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that .,Industrial Designer,238
14,Well if you lost th,User Interface,239
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer,240
14,Well uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,241
14,is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,242
14,I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .,User Interface,243
14,"Well , I don't think uh {gap} .",Industrial Designer,244
14,Uh that's just uh {disfmarker},User Interface,245
14,"No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} .",Industrial Designer,246
14,"And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,",Industrial Designer,246
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,247
14,so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that .,Industrial Designer,248
14,"You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .",Industrial Designer,248
14,{gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .,User Interface,249
14,"Yes , something like that .",Industrial Designer,250
14,"But that will be very costly , I think .",Industrial Designer,250
14,"Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .",Project Manager,251
14,So that's not a good idea .,Industrial Designer,252
14,Yeah .,Marketing,253
14,"Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,",Project Manager,254
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,255
14,I will .,Industrial Designer,255
14,Yeah .,User Interface,256
14,because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .,Project Manager,257
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,258
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,258
14,But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated,Industrial Designer,258
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,259
14,um and it will become more costly also .,Industrial Designer,260
14,Yep .,Project Manager,261
14,Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used .,Industrial Designer,262
14,And there are some implepe imp,Industrial Designer,262
14,"And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?",User Interface,263
14,"Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .",Industrial Designer,264
14,It's a unique item uh {disfmarker},User Interface,265
14,"Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .",Project Manager,266
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,267
14,It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .,User Interface,268
14,It's a different {disfmarker} exactly .,Project Manager,269
14,"It's an uni an unique feature ,",Project Manager,269
14,Yeah .,Marketing,270
14,Yeah .,User Interface,271
14,and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .,Project Manager,272
14,"And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .",User Interface,273
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,274
14,What should we choose in in design ?,User Interface,275
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,276
14,"Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .",Project Manager,276
14,"Well , the extra functions .",User Interface,277
14,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,278
14,I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .,Marketing,279
14,Okay .,Project Manager,280
14,"Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .",Marketing,281
14,Used option .,User Interface,282
14,Okay .,Project Manager,283
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,283
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,284
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,284
14,"Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .",Project Manager,285
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,285
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,286
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,287
14,"Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .",Marketing,288
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,289
14,"Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .",Project Manager,289
14,So {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,290
14,Yeah .,Marketing,290
14,"Well , we skip that .",Project Manager,291
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,292
14,Okay .,Project Manager,293
14,"Well , so it just th the basic functions .",User Interface,294
14,And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .,User Interface,294
14,"No , no .",Industrial Designer,295
14,No .,Project Manager,296
14,So {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,297
14,Nope .,Marketing,298
14,So that's out of the question .,Industrial Designer,299
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,300
14,Yeah .,User Interface,301
14,Just through uh the easy uh design .,User Interface,301
14,We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .,User Interface,301
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,302
14,Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .,Project Manager,303
14,I think also .,Industrial Designer,304
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,304
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer,304
14,No .,Project Manager,305
14,So {disfmarker},User Interface,306
14,we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface,Industrial Designer,307
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,308
14,"Okay ,",Project Manager,308
14,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,309
14,"Ruud , how do you feel about that ?",Project Manager,310
14,"Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker}",Project Manager,310
14,"Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might ,",Marketing,311
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,312
14,'cause young people uh like new features .,Marketing,313
14,Mm yeah .,Project Manager,314
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,315
14,"Yeah , that's right .",Industrial Designer,316
14,"Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,317
14,Mm .,Industrial Designer,318
14,"Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .",User Interface,319
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,320
14,"Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility .",Industrial Designer,320
14,"You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .",Industrial Designer,320
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,321
14,"Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,322
14,"But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh",Project Manager,323
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,324
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,324
14,Ok like that .,Industrial Designer,324
14,"Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that .",Industrial Designer,324
14,I don't know if if it's user-friendly .,Industrial Designer,324
14,That's your field of expertise .,Industrial Designer,324
14,But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?,Project Manager,325
14,"Yeah , I don't know yet .",User Interface,326
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,326
14,Because we do not implement uh a user history .,Project Manager,327
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,328
14,"There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .",Industrial Designer,328
14,"I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,329
14,W Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,330
14,"Well , maybe we can use a light for that .",Industrial Designer,330
14,"When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up .",Industrial Designer,330
14,"So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume .",Industrial Designer,330
14,Something like that .,Industrial Designer,330
14,"And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .",Marketing,331
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,332
14,Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .,Project Manager,332
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,333
14,"But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,",User Interface,334
14,"Yeah , draw draw it on the board .",Project Manager,335
14,"should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank .",User Interface,336
14,Oh .,User Interface,336
14,"yeah , something like that .",Industrial Designer,337
14,Oh,Industrial Designer,337
14,It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions .,User Interface,338
14,Instead of a stick .,User Interface,338
14,"It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes .",Industrial Designer,339
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,339
14,A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down,User Interface,340
14,"Yeah , it can break down .",Project Manager,341
14,Hmm .,Industrial Designer,342
14,or uh,User Interface,343
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,344
14,"just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .",User Interface,345
14,Yeah .,Marketing,346
14,"And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .",Industrial Designer,347
14,Yeah .,User Interface,348
14,"I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .",Industrial Designer,349
14,A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh .,Marketing,350
14,But you're the marketing man .,Industrial Designer,351
14,"And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .",Marketing,352
14,Geez .,User Interface,353
14,"Well , volume and something uh like that .",User Interface,353
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,353
14,Uh-huh .,Project Manager,354
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,354
14,The programme up and down .,User Interface,355
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,355
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,356
14,{vocalsound},Marketing,357
14,"Okay , yeah .",Project Manager,358
14,"And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .",User Interface,359
14,"Okay , that's good .",Industrial Designer,360
14,"Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options .",Project Manager,361
14,Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques .,Project Manager,361
14,"Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things .",Project Manager,361
14,We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .,Project Manager,361
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,362
14,But I think our our next step to look at is just that .,User Interface,363
14,So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do .,User Interface,363
14,"Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think .",User Interface,363
14,"Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting .",Project Manager,364
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,364
14,Yes ?,User Interface,365
14,We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience .,Project Manager,366
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,367
14,{vocalsound} Okay .,Industrial Designer,368
14,but teletext is so uh is just scrapped .,User Interface,369
14,"'Kay ,",User Interface,369
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,370
14,Do do you want a list of functions ?,Industrial Designer,370
14,Do you want an explicit list ?,Industrial Designer,370
14,Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?,Industrial Designer,370
14,"Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .",Project Manager,371
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,372
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,372
14,The ten digits .,User Interface,373
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,374
14,"Well , for example , that that's what we should think about .",Project Manager,375
14,{gap} l how is the remote going to look ?,Project Manager,375
14,"Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,375
14,"Oh , and just one function .",User Interface,376
14,"The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change",User Interface,376
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,377
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,377
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,378
14,A bit of a split mode .,Project Manager,378
14,Change .,Industrial Designer,379
14,Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah .,Project Manager,380
14,{disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,381
14,"Yes , yes .",Industrial Designer,382
14,Dual channel watch .,Project Manager,383
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,384
14,"Okay , well um",Project Manager,385
14,Yeah .,User Interface,386
14,m maybe I should write that down .,Project Manager,387
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,387
14,{vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,388
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,389
14,you're the secretary .,Industrial Designer,390
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,390
14,"Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?",Project Manager,391
14,Mielsen .,Marketing,392
14,"Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen .",Project Manager,393
14,Right .,Project Manager,393
14,Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder .,Project Manager,393
14,"So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it .",Project Manager,393
14,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,393
14,"Mm okay ,",Industrial Designer,394
14,Alright .,User Interface,395
14,"but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .",Industrial Designer,396
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,396
14,"Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,397
14,Yeah .,Marketing,398
14,"if you want to do it , Sebastian .",Project Manager,399
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,399
14,{vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker},User Interface,400
14,{vocalsound} Sure .,Industrial Designer,401
14,{vocalsound} {gap} .,Industrial Designer,401
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,401
14,"Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}",Project Manager,402
14,{vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker},User Interface,403
14,Volume .,Project Manager,404
14,Programme .,Project Manager,404
14,Uh dual channel .,Project Manager,404
14,Uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,404
14,"Yes , that's important .",Industrial Designer,405
14,And and do we want um the ten digits ?,Project Manager,406
14,The ten digits ?,User Interface,407
14,"Yeah , I believe so .",User Interface,407
14,"Well , are are you sure ?",Industrial Designer,408
14,"Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .",Marketing,409
14,I'm not so sure .,Industrial Designer,410
14,Yeah .,User Interface,411
14,"Well , that's complicated ,",Industrial Designer,412
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,413
14,but is that so relevant ?,Industrial Designer,414
14,Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that .,Industrial Designer,414
14,If it were so .,Industrial Designer,414
14,I wouldn't buy it personally .,User Interface,415
14,A remote control without the ten digits .,User Interface,415
14,"Okay ,",Industrial Designer,416
14,Uh and I think the most {disfmarker},User Interface,417
14,I can imagine when,Industrial Designer,418
14,I agree actually .,Project Manager,419
14,{vocalsound},Project Manager,419
14,"Just elder elder people would would buy it ,",User Interface,420
14,"I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .",Industrial Designer,421
14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing,422
14,but {disfmarker},User Interface,423
14,"But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons .",Industrial Designer,424
14,That's enough .,Industrial Designer,424
14,But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .,Project Manager,425
14,But {disfmarker},Marketing,426
14,Yep .,User Interface,427
14,The older people only use five of them .,User Interface,427
14,"Well ,",Industrial Designer,428
14,"Yeah ,",Marketing,429
14,but how how often do you watch all these channels ?,Industrial Designer,430
14,"and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .",Marketing,431
14,Often .,Project Manager,432
14,"No , you're probably right .",Industrial Designer,433
14,So {disfmarker},Marketing,434
14,Yeah .,User Interface,435
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,436
14,But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull .,Industrial Designer,436
14,Don't you think ?,Industrial Designer,436
14,"Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,437
14,The design .,Industrial Designer,438
14,On the design .,User Interface,439
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,440
14,"Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it .",Industrial Designer,440
14,Well {disfmarker},Marketing,441
14,You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy,Project Manager,442
14,And {disfmarker},Marketing,443
14,"by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .",Project Manager,444
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,445
14,So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker},Project Manager,446
14,Yeah .,User Interface,447
14,"Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .",Industrial Designer,448
14,"Exactly , exactly .",Project Manager,449
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,450
14,And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it .,Marketing,451
14,"Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker}",Marketing,451
14,"Okay , speech .",Project Manager,452
14,"Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .",Industrial Designer,453
14,Yeah .,User Interface,454
14,"So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel .",Industrial Designer,455
14,That's one thing .,Industrial Designer,455
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,456
14,And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .,Industrial Designer,457
14,To find {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,458
14,"So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .",Industrial Designer,459
14,Yeah .,Marketing,460
14,Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits,Project Manager,461
14,But maybe when we uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,462
14,"but keep the programme and the volume ,",Project Manager,463
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,464
14,"because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,465
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,466
14,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer,466
14,Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition .,Marketing,467
14,So then we should implement such a but,Marketing,467
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,468
14,But we do focus on younger people .,Project Manager,468
14,We d it it's a board uh decision .,Project Manager,468
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,469
14,Yes .,Marketing,470
14,Well .,Industrial Designer,471
14,"I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .",Industrial Designer,471
14,So,User Interface,472
14,Okay .,Project Manager,473
14,we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .,User Interface,474
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,475
14,"Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage .",Industrial Designer,475
14,It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function .,Industrial Designer,475
14,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,476
14,Okay .,Project Manager,477
14,"So that's that's a big advantage , I think .",Industrial Designer,478
14,"Okay , g good .",Project Manager,479
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,480
14,Okay .,Project Manager,481
14,There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this .,Industrial Designer,482
14,Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult .,Industrial Designer,482
14,So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .,Industrial Designer,482
14,Mm .,Project Manager,483
14,But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it .,Industrial Designer,484
14,Yep .,Project Manager,485
14,There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .,Industrial Designer,486
14,Okay .,Project Manager,487
14,"So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .",Industrial Designer,488
14,But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?,Project Manager,489
14,You have to do nothing for it .,Industrial Designer,490
14,M {vocalsound},Marketing,491
14,{vocalsound} Twelve dollar fifty .,User Interface,492
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,492
14,Because it seems like a very {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,493
14,"{vocalsound} Maybe , maybe not .",Industrial Designer,494
14,"And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .",Marketing,495
14,I'll have to find that out .,Industrial Designer,496
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,496
14,"So {disfmarker} No , that's very cheap .",Industrial Designer,496
14,'Cause when {disfmarker},Marketing,497
14,Is a cradle very cheap ?,Project Manager,498
14,"It's {disfmarker} Oh , it's very cheap .",Industrial Designer,499
14,That's no problem .,Industrial Designer,499
14,It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .,Industrial Designer,499
14,"I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .",Project Manager,500
14,"It's {disfmarker} Yes , but they're they're mass production .",Industrial Designer,501
14,Yeah .,Marketing,502
14,They're very cheap .,Industrial Designer,503
14,Okay .,Project Manager,504
14,So it will cost us p practically nothing .,Industrial Designer,505
14,Okay .,Project Manager,506
14,We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting .,Project Manager,506
14,"Um {vocalsound} I would like to hear um {disfmarker} maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important .",Project Manager,506
14,"Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data .",Project Manager,506
14,Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?,Project Manager,506
14,Um I think we dealt with the most important information .,Marketing,507
14,Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to .,Marketing,507
14,So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .,Marketing,507
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,508
14,Okay .,Project Manager,509
14,"But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too .",Marketing,510
14,So {disfmarker} I don't think that's a big problem,Marketing,510
14,Okay .,Project Manager,511
14,"Okay , so",Project Manager,511
14,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,512
14,although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh {disfmarker} Profitable .,Project Manager,513
14,"We we {disfmarker} yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",Project Manager,513
14,Yes .,Marketing,514
14,"Yeah , profitable .",Marketing,514
14,Profitable .,Industrial Designer,515
14,Okay .,Project Manager,516
14,Yes .,Marketing,517
14,O okay .,Project Manager,518
14,{vocalsound} Um Roo .,Project Manager,518
14,{gap} {disfmarker} Nothing to add .,Project Manager,518
14,"I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .",User Interface,519
14,Sebastian ?,Project Manager,520
14,Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities .,Industrial Designer,521
14,Um,Industrial Designer,521
14,Yeah ?,Project Manager,522
14,Great .,Project Manager,522
14,so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design .,Industrial Designer,523
14,"So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .",Industrial Designer,523
14,So that's one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} those are the choices we have to make .,Industrial Designer,523
14,"But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that {disfmarker} these kinds of things .",Industrial Designer,523
14,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,524
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,524
14,"Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience .",Industrial Designer,525
14,"Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like .",Industrial Designer,525
14,"The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .",Industrial Designer,525
14,Yep .,Project Manager,526
14,Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not {disfmarker} do not implement these buttons .,Industrial Designer,527
14,"{vocalsound} If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap .",Industrial Designer,527
14,So that's another {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,527
14,"Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ?",Project Manager,528
14,The the board {disfmarker},Project Manager,528
14,"well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .",Industrial Designer,529
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,530
14,And this even uh makes it more cheapy .,Industrial Designer,531
14,But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?,User Interface,532
14,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,533
14,The board .,Project Manager,534
14,The circuit board .,User Interface,535
14,The circuit board .,Industrial Designer,536
14,The fewer buttons you can use on it .,User Interface,537
14,"No , it's th",Project Manager,538
14,"The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .",Industrial Designer,539
14,yeah .,Project Manager,540
14,"Yeah , okay .",User Interface,541
14,"It's the other way around , yeah .",Project Manager,542
14,Yeah .,User Interface,543
14,"And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip .",Industrial Designer,544
14,So that's that's another advantage .,Industrial Designer,544
14,It shouldn't be a big issue .,Project Manager,545
14,Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition .,User Interface,546
14,"So {disfmarker} Yes , because I don't know {disfmarker} Yes .",Industrial Designer,547
14,I d I really don't know .,Industrial Designer,547
14,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,547
14,No .,User Interface,548
14,Okay .,Project Manager,549
14,It can be costly .,Industrial Designer,550
14,Maybe not .,Industrial Designer,550
14,"I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it .",Project Manager,551
14,Maybe you will get some information on that .,Project Manager,551
14,Yes .,Industrial Designer,552
14,Um I'm not sure how how that {disfmarker},Project Manager,553
14,"Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh {vocalsound} have a lo uh look at it .",Industrial Designer,554
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,554
14,Yep .,Project Manager,555
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,556
14,"Okay , great .",Project Manager,557
14,"Um {vocalsound} well , I think we're qui quite done .",Project Manager,557
14,"We're done , I think .",User Interface,558
14,Um for now we will have the lunch break .,Project Manager,559
14,How nice .,Industrial Designer,560
14,"Um I'm {disfmarker} don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out .",Project Manager,561
14,Me neither .,User Interface,562
14,"Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it .",Project Manager,563
14,Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder .,Project Manager,563
14,"If you want to look at it um well , just do .",Project Manager,563
14,"Um {vocalsound} the Interface Designer , um I would like to {disfmarker} the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .",Project Manager,563
14,Interface {disfmarker} industrial .,User Interface,564
14,"Uh {disfmarker} I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry .",Project Manager,565
14,Yeah .,User Interface,566
14,{vocalsound},User Interface,566
14,"User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept .",Project Manager,567
14,"Well , we understand .",Industrial Designer,568
14,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,568
14,And um,Project Manager,569
14,Uh the only problem is it {disfmarker} that it depends on the divisions {disfmarker} the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes .,User Interface,570
14,About the voice recognition .,User Interface,570
14,Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,571
14,"Well , i it should be easy ,",Project Manager,572
14,Well {disfmarker},User Interface,573
14,that's w w what we concluded .,Project Manager,574
14,It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons .,Project Manager,574
14,S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one .,Project Manager,574
14,"And um {vocalsound} um yeah , some some fancy lights .",Project Manager,574
14,Mm yes .,Industrial Designer,575
14,Yeah .,User Interface,576
14,I think that's what we decided .,Project Manager,577
14,So we drop the voice recognition ?,Industrial Designer,578
14,"No no no , we didn't {disfmarker}",Project Manager,579
14,Or {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,580
14,but it shouldn't be integrated {disfmarker},Project Manager,581
14,Oh .,Industrial Designer,582
14,"yeah , it's {disfmarker} of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the {disfmarker}",Project Manager,583
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,584
14,Well um do we really have to decide now,Industrial Designer,584
14,No .,Project Manager,585
14,or can we decide next meeting ?,Industrial Designer,586
14,We can decide the next meeting .,Project Manager,587
14,Yep .,Project Manager,587
14,Okay .,Industrial Designer,588
14,Because I'll have some updated info on that uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,588
14,Yeah .,Project Manager,589
14,I guess all of you have i updated info .,Project Manager,589
14,I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching .,Project Manager,589
14,Yep .,User Interface,590
14,"And I'm sure the market will um uh {vocalsound} {gap} uh will change , adapt",Project Manager,591
14,Hmm .,Marketing,592
14,Adapt .,User Interface,593
14,Adapt .,Industrial Designer,594
14,Left .,Marketing,595
14,and um so,Project Manager,596
14,Hmm .,Marketing,597
14,we will see that .,Project Manager,598
14,"Um yeah , that's it for now .",Project Manager,598
14,That's it .,User Interface,599
14,Any other questions,Project Manager,600
14,'Kay .,User Interface,601
14,or can we have the lunch ?,Project Manager,602
14,We can have the lunch .,Industrial Designer,603
14,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,604
14,Yeah .,Marketing,605
14,I'll take the lunch .,User Interface,606
14,Good .,Project Manager,607
15,If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .,Project Manager,1
15,Hmm .,User Interface,2
15,Is that someone's ?,Marketing,3
15,Is that {gap} .,Project Manager,4
15,Thank you .,User Interface,5
15,"{gap} three , apparently .",Project Manager,6
15,Hmm .,User Interface,7
15,Hmm .,User Interface,7
15,"Okay , you all switched on .",Project Manager,8
15,Okay .,Marketing,9
15,"Yep , me too .",User Interface,10
15,I presume we're good to go .,Project Manager,11
15,"Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,",Project Manager,11
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,12
15,"standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor .",Project Manager,13
15,We wanted a stand-by function .,Project Manager,13
15,"The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .",Project Manager,13
15,Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design .,Project Manager,13
15,"Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .",Project Manager,13
15,Um {vocalsound} and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .,Project Manager,13
15,Um {vocalsound} and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ .,Project Manager,13
15,Okay ?,Project Manager,13
15,Prototype presentation .,Project Manager,13
15,Is that {gap} for us ?,Industrial Designer,14
15,Yep .,User Interface,15
15,I think that would be you .,Project Manager,16
15,Okay .,Industrial Designer,17
15,"Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .",User Interface,18
15,"Yeah , shall I show ?",Industrial Designer,19
15,Yeah .,User Interface,20
15,I'll show .,Industrial Designer,21
15,Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it,Industrial Designer,21
15,I can hold it like {disfmarker},User Interface,22
15,Make sure the camera's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,23
15,"Yeah ,",User Interface,24
15,and I'll I'll show you the presentation .,Industrial Designer,25
15,so {disfmarker},User Interface,26
15,Can I just nick your {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,27
15,"Yes , yes you can .",Project Manager,28
15,"Wait a second , I'll get it out .",Project Manager,28
15,{gap},User Interface,29

15,Thank you .,Industrial Designer,36
15,Um not now .,User Interface,37
15,Oh .,User Interface,37
15,{vocalsound} You should have one of those things and you can just take it off .,Project Manager,38
15,Yeah .,User Interface,39
15,Ta-da .,Project Manager,40
15,"Oh , where are the hinges ?",User Interface,41
15,{vocalsound},User Interface,41
15,{vocalsound},Project Manager,42
15,"Okay , so",Industrial Designer,43
15,Right .,Project Manager,44
15,"this is our look and feel presentation , the final {disfmarker} our final presentation .",Industrial Designer,45
15,Mm 'kay .,Project Manager,46
15,And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there .,Industrial Designer,47
15,Um,Industrial Designer,47
15,'Kay .,User Interface,48
15,You able to look {gap} ?,User Interface,48
15,"It's gonna have a a plastic body {vocalsound} um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .",Industrial Designer,49
15,Yep .,User Interface,50
15,{gap},User Interface,50
15,This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing,Industrial Designer,51
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,52
15,"um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker} they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .",Industrial Designer,53
15,Okay .,Project Manager,54
15,"Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it .",Industrial Designer,55
15,Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,55
15,{vocalsound} {gap} .,User Interface,56
15,"and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top",Industrial Designer,57
15,The black and white touch screen wherein people can {disfmarker},User Interface,58
15,Mm .,Project Manager,59
15,So it's flush .,Project Manager,59
15,and the buttons at the bottom would d,Industrial Designer,60
15,Right .,User Interface,61

15,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,64
15,{gap} {gap},User Interface,65
15,"{vocalsound} And working on the inside we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries , which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,66
15,"So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,",Project Manager,67
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,68
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,68
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,69
15,'cause it's the top part that's {disfmarker} okay .,Project Manager,70
15,"Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound} and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap .",Industrial Designer,71
15,"So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .",Industrial Designer,71
15,{vocalsound} Or something .,Marketing,72
15,{vocalsound},Marketing,72
15,{vocalsound},User Interface,73
15,{vocalsound} And then {disfmarker} yeah .,Industrial Designer,74
15,It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something .,Industrial Designer,74
15,"It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .",Industrial Designer,74
15,{vocalsound},Marketing,75
15,Okay .,Project Manager,76
15,'Kay .,User Interface,77
15,I'm under the sofa .,Project Manager,78
15,Ah oka,User Interface,79
15,"Or , that would be too complicated .",Project Manager,80
15,"Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe .",Industrial Designer,81
15,You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is .,Industrial Designer,81
15,"Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .",Industrial Designer,81
15,Infrared {gap} .,Project Manager,82
15,"Um it would it would have {disfmarker} obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .",Industrial Designer,83
15,"{vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .",Industrial Designer,83
15,"And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker} we haven't {disfmarker} I don't think we actually put it on .",Industrial Designer,83
15,Like here .,Project Manager,84
15,"Yeah , yeah , something like that .",Industrial Designer,85
15,Infrared could be here also .,User Interface,86
15,"Yeah , here .",User Interface,86
15,Okay .,Project Manager,87
15,"Actually , no , it would be {disfmarker} it would have to be on the on the front .",Project Manager,87
15,"Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .",Industrial Designer,88
15,{gap} .,User Interface,89
15,"So when it's {disfmarker} even if it's open here , the signals would go {gap} .",User Interface,89
15,"Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you .",Project Manager,90
15,"It's still pointing ,",Project Manager,90
15,"So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,91
15,yes .,Project Manager,92
15,Yeah .,User Interface,93
15,"Yeah , that would make sense .",Project Manager,94
15,And then finally um on to the interface .,Industrial Designer,95
15,"{vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen",Industrial Designer,95
15,{gap} This one right here .,User Interface,96
15,"which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .",Industrial Designer,97
15,{gap} .,User Interface,98
15,Okay .,Project Manager,99
15,"And now we've {disfmarker} we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .",Industrial Designer,100
15,Which is {disfmarker},User Interface,101
15,But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product,Project Manager,102
15,No d not not actually .,Industrial Designer,103
15,"No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing .",Industrial Designer,103
15,No .,User Interface,104
15,once it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,105
15,Look up to it .,User Interface,106
15,Okay .,Project Manager,107
15,"And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics ,",Industrial Designer,108
15,Thank you very much .,Project Manager,109
15,as that is {disfmarker} that's the company logo {gap} .,Industrial Designer,110
15,Yay .,User Interface,111
15,"Wrapping it all up , okay .",Project Manager,112
15,Well done .,Marketing,113
15,Um I've now got evaluation criteria .,Project Manager,114
15,Certainly .,Marketing,115
15,So this is the one .,User Interface,116
15,Sorry .,User Interface,116
15,It's to be presented {gap} .,Project Manager,117
15,There you go .,Industrial Designer,118
15,{gap} .,Industrial Designer,118
15,Logged in ?,Marketing,119
15,Thank you .,Marketing,119
15,Oops .,Marketing,119
15,Okay .,Project Manager,120
15,Evaluation .,User Interface,121
15,{gap} .,User Interface,121
15,{vocalsound},Project Manager,122
15,Mm um I I think this is {gap} chip .,User Interface,123
15,"It's quite similar to what it was before , though .",Project Manager,124
15,Okay .,Marketing,125
15,Sorry .,Project Manager,126
15,This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .,Marketing,127
15,{vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation .,Marketing,127
15,"Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .",Marketing,127
15,"So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?",Marketing,127
15,"Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here .",Marketing,127
15,"The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .",Marketing,127
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,128
15,"{vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .",Marketing,129
15,"{vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those .",Marketing,129
15,"I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .",Marketing,129
15,"We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .",Marketing,129
15,"We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up ,",Marketing,129
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,130
15,and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .,Marketing,131
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,132
15,Does that seem clear ?,Marketing,133
15,Any questions there ?,Marketing,133
15,"Ah , it's perfect .",User Interface,134
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,135
15,we're going to look at these crite So,Marketing,136
15,"Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market {disfmarker}",User Interface,137
15,"Yes ,",Marketing,138
15,okay .,User Interface,139
15,{gap},Industrial Designer,140
15,we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one,Marketing,141
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,142
15,and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .,Marketing,143
15,Okay .,Project Manager,144
15,Is that okay ?,Marketing,145
15,'Kay .,User Interface,146
15,"One is true , seven is false .",Marketing,147
15,Right .,Marketing,147
15,So I won't write all of that out again .,Marketing,147
15,"It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating .",Marketing,147
15,"B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ .",Marketing,147
15,{vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am .,Marketing,147
15,{vocalsound},Marketing,147
15,{vocalsound} Just write small .,Project Manager,148
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,149
15,Criteria and rating .,Marketing,150
15,"Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .",Marketing,150
15,How about that ?,Marketing,150
15,"Yeah , so you can {disfmarker}",User Interface,151
15,Yeah .,Project Manager,152
15,That works .,Project Manager,152
15,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,153
15,Okay .,Marketing,154
15,"So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .",Marketing,154
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,155
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,156
15,Okay .,Marketing,157
15,"Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel .",Marketing,157
15,How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy {disfmarker} it is a fancy look and feel .,Marketing,157
15,"One is true , seven is false .",Marketing,157
15,My own rating for that would be a two .,Marketing,157
15,One is true and seven is false .,Marketing,157
15,{vocalsound} I would agree .,Project Manager,158
15,"Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh {vocalsound} two {disfmarker} yeah ,",Industrial Designer,159
15,I'll just go this way .,Marketing,160
15,Okay .,Project Manager,161
15,'Kay .,User Interface,162
15,two or three .,Industrial Designer,163
15,Two .,Marketing,164
15,"No , three .",Industrial Designer,165
15,Three .,Industrial Designer,165
15,Okay .,Marketing,166
15,I would say two .,Project Manager,167
15,Two .,Marketing,168
15,{vocalsound} I would say four .,User Interface,169
15,"A four , okay .",Marketing,170
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,171
15,"Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ?",Marketing,172
15,"Uh two and three quarters , it that right .",Marketing,172
15,Almost three .,User Interface,173
15,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer,174
15,Two and three quarters ?,Marketing,175
15,I think yeah .,User Interface,176
15,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,177
15,Okay .,Marketing,178
15,"Two point seven five , there we go .",Marketing,178
15,"{vocalsound} Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative .",Marketing,178
15,I would give that a three .,Marketing,178
15,I'd give it a one .,Industrial Designer,179
15,Okay .,Marketing,180
15,Not that you're biased {vocalsound} in that it {disfmarker} the designer .,Marketing,180
15,"No , no , not at all .",Industrial Designer,181
15,A two .,Project Manager,182
15,"Oh sorry , I I got it wrong .",User Interface,183
15,"The first one rating , I'm sorry .",User Interface,183
15,Can you just make it two ?,User Interface,183
15,The first .,User Interface,183
15,The average {disfmarker},Marketing,184
15,"Yeah , I I just {gap} it the other way .",User Interface,185
15,"oh , for you ?",Marketing,186
15,You want your rating to be a two ?,Marketing,186
15,Is that what you're saying ?,Marketing,186
15,"Uh in {gap} Yep , I just got {disfmarker}",User Interface,187
15,Okay .,Marketing,188
15,{gap},User Interface,189
15,"So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end .",Marketing,190
15,"It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay ,",Marketing,190
15,two point f,User Interface,191
15,and we're just waiting for your rating,Marketing,192
15,It's just two point five for that one .,Project Manager,193
15,f,Marketing,194
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,195
15,"Two point five , okay .",Marketing,196
15,"Losing one decimal place , that's okay .",Marketing,196
15,"One is a {gap} , seven is false , okay .",User Interface,197
15,"So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?",Marketing,198
15,Two .,User Interface,199
15,"Two , okay .",Marketing,200
15,So that is eight .,Marketing,200
15,"That brings it down to two ,",Marketing,200
15,Two .,Industrial Designer,201
15,"nice and simple , yeah .",Marketing,202
15,"Okay , ease of use .",Marketing,202
15,Easy to use ?,Marketing,202
15,"Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .",Marketing,202
15,Two .,Industrial Designer,203
15,Two .,Marketing,204
15,I would say a two .,Project Manager,205
15,I would say a two .,Project Manager,205
15,"A two , okay .",Marketing,206
15,Two .,User Interface,207

15,{vocalsound},User Interface,209
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,210
15,"{vocalsound} We'll just put almost two ,",Marketing,211
15,One point seven f five .,Project Manager,212
15,because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .,Marketing,213
15,"Okay , mm-hmm .",Project Manager,214
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,215
15,Okay .,Marketing,216
15,"Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later .",Marketing,216
15,Um mm now we're looking at,Marketing,216
15,D_ .,Industrial Designer,217
15,"it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .",Marketing,218
15,One .,Industrial Designer,219
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,219
15,Right .,Marketing,220
15,"So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .",Marketing,220
15,"Yeah , that's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,221
15,Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?,Marketing,222
15,"No , no , the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,",Industrial Designer,223
15,White .,User Interface,224
15,With {disfmarker} for the plastic ?,User Interface,224
15,Uh blue .,User Interface,224
15,but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .,Industrial Designer,225
15,Right .,Marketing,226
15,Any {disfmarker},User Interface,227
15,So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .,Marketing,228
15,Right .,User Interface,229
15,"Yeah , yeah , yeah",Industrial Designer,230
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,231
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,232
15,Okay .,Marketing,233
15,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,234
15,And the spongy feel is no problem with that .,Marketing,235
15,"Yeah , because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case .",User Interface,236
15,"No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .",Industrial Designer,237
15,Okay .,Marketing,238
15,In that case it's got to be a one for me .,Marketing,238
15,"Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .",Industrial Designer,239
15,Yep .,Marketing,240
15,One .,Project Manager,241
15,Everybody ?,Marketing,242
15,Okay .,Marketing,242
15,One .,User Interface,243
15,{vocalsound} That part was nice and easy .,Marketing,244
15,Mm .,User Interface,245
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,246
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,246
15,Okay .,Marketing,247
15,Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .,Marketing,247
15,Mm .,Industrial Designer,248
15,I don't think we've really touched on that a lot .,Marketing,249
15,No .,Industrial Designer,250
15,"We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .",Marketing,251
15,"We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?",Marketing,251
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,252
15,"Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_",Project Manager,253
15,It's meant to be .,Industrial Designer,254
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,255
15,it's meant to .,Project Manager,256
15,Um,Project Manager,256
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,257
15,maybe because it's slightl,Project Manager,258
15,{gap},Industrial Designer,259
15,"with the size that we've got it's quite small ,",Project Manager,260
15,{gap},Industrial Designer,261
15,but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .,Project Manager,262
15,Mm .,Marketing,263
15,"So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .",Project Manager,264
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,265
15,Right .,Marketing,265
15,It's quite obvious just big buttons .,Project Manager,266
15,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,266
15,Right .,Marketing,267
15,I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .,Marketing,267
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,268
15,"Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually ,",Industrial Designer,268
15,"A five , okay .",Marketing,269
15,'cause {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,270
15,Four .,Project Manager,271
15,Four and a four okay .,Marketing,272
15,Four .,User Interface,273
15,Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one ?,Marketing,274
15,{gap},User Interface,275
15,So that's four point two five .,Marketing,276
15,Yep .,Industrial Designer,277
15,"And finally , last but not least , easy to locate .",Marketing,278
15,"Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really {disfmarker}",Marketing,278
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,279
15,have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?,Marketing,280
15,"Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition ,",Industrial Designer,281
15,Voice r recognition .,User Interface,282
15,"It was the I'm here thing ,",Marketing,283
15,yeah .,Industrial Designer,284
15,yep .,Marketing,285
15,And are we happy with the costs on that ?,Marketing,285
15,"That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .",Marketing,285
15,"Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible .",Industrial Designer,286
15,That sounds good then .,Marketing,287
15,"I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ .",Marketing,287
15,"So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .",Marketing,287
15,Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand,Industrial Designer,288
15,A standard .,Project Manager,289
15,it would be quite loud .,Industrial Designer,290
15,It would be .,Project Manager,291

15,yeah .,Industrial Designer,296
15,Okay .,Marketing,297
15,Logical .,Marketing,297
15,That's a one for me .,Marketing,297

15,"The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .",Marketing,310

15,We happy to go ahead ?,Marketing,313

15,that um {disfmarker} Okay .,Project Manager,336
15,We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value .,Project Manager,336
15,So are we still on for kinetic ?,Project Manager,336
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,337
15,Yes .,Marketing,338
15,Okay .,Project Manager,339
15,"See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .",Project Manager,339
15,Um it might have influenced our choice .,Project Manager,339
15,"Right , what's happening with the electronics ?",Project Manager,339
15,It was a regular chip on print,Industrial Designer,340
15,Chip on print .,User Interface,341
15,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,342
15,Double-curved .,Project Manager,343
15,"Oh , no , no , no , the um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's {disfmarker} you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one .",Industrial Designer,344
15,"In the top , it's the number",Industrial Designer,344
15,"Oh , right ,",Project Manager,345
15,of c yeah {gap} .,Industrial Designer,346
15,okay .,Project Manager,347
15,Thanks .,Project Manager,347
15,"Yeah ,",Industrial Designer,348
15,"So , would there be two ?",Project Manager,349
15,"and {disfmarker} yeah , just a {disfmarker} no , one reg v uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,350
15,One chip .,Project Manager,351
15,"Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .",Industrial Designer,352
15,Okay .,User Interface,353
15,Okay .,Project Manager,354
15,Yep .,User Interface,355
15,And they're double curved .,Industrial Designer,356
15,No .,Industrial Designer,356
15,Single-curved .,User Interface,357
15,One double curve .,Project Manager,358
15,"Y Two ,",Industrial Designer,359
15,"Two curves , yeah .",User Interface,360
15,'cause it's two .,Industrial Designer,361
15,But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit .,Marketing,362
15,So it can rest .,Marketing,362
15,So what's a single curve then ?,Project Manager,363
15,"Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w",Industrial Designer,364
15,It would just be a flat bottom with one curve .,Marketing,365
15,{gap} like a domed thing .,Marketing,365
15,"yeah , I think I think it's {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,366
15,Single-cu,User Interface,367
15,So just one double {disfmarker},Project Manager,368
15,One double-curved .,Industrial Designer,369
15,Mm .,Marketing,370
15,Yeah .,Project Manager,371
15,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,371
15,{gap} .,User Interface,372
15,And one {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,373
15,Plastic and rubber .,User Interface,374
15,"no , 'cause one {disfmarker} yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's",Industrial Designer,375
15,"The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over .",Marketing,376
15,Yeah .,Marketing,376
15,Mm .,Project Manager,377
15,"{vocalsound} Um we've got plastic and rubber ,",Project Manager,377
15,a plastic .,Industrial Designer,378
15,haven't we ?,Project Manager,379
15,Yeah .,User Interface,380
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,381
15,Plastic one and maybe rubber point five .,User Interface,382
15,And special colour .,Industrial Designer,383
15,{vocalsound} {gap} .,Project Manager,384
15,"No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing ,",User Interface,385
15,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,386
15,we can put point five .,User Interface,387
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,388
15,Do you think ?,Project Manager,389
15,"Yeah , I think it allows the point five , yeah .",User Interface,390
15,We can use that .,User Interface,390
15,Okay .,Project Manager,391
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,392
15,What does it mean if you put point five for that ?,Marketing,393
15,It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually .,User Interface,394
15,We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .,User Interface,394
15,"It would be like saying we're using {disfmarker} See , it says case material .",Project Manager,395
15,So,Project Manager,395
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,396
15,"we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?",Project Manager,397
15,"No , no , that's {disfmarker} it's as an extra .",Industrial Designer,398
15,"It's including , it's including .",Project Manager,399
15,"Right , okay .",Marketing,400
15,"So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .",Industrial Designer,401
15,"But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ?",Marketing,402
15,{gap},Industrial Designer,403
15,There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing .,Marketing,404
15,So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?,Marketing,404
15,"Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half .",Project Manager,405
15,Okay .,Marketing,406
15,"Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .",Project Manager,407
15,"Yeah , okay .",Industrial Designer,408
15,Mm .,Marketing,409
15,"No , we don't step on anyone's toes .",Project Manager,410

15,{vocalsound} I think we could change the battery also .,User Interface,421
15,Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .,User Interface,421
15,"Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?",Marketing,422
15,Has that not gone up ?,Project Manager,423
15,Well yes .,Industrial Designer,424
15,"Is it {disfmarker} oh , it's brought it slightly down .",Marketing,425
15,"Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot .",Project Manager,426
15,"So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing ,",Marketing,427
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,428
15,is that going to make a difference ?,Marketing,429
15,"Uncurved , flat .",User Interface,430

15,{gap} .,User Interface,444
15,{vocalsound} I don't think so .,User Interface,444

15,If we tr um .,Marketing,453
15,"If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?",Marketing,453
15,And going to a regular bat Yeah .,User Interface,454
15,"Yeah , the standard , it {vocalsound} um it would make one difference .",Industrial Designer,455

15,where's the voice recognition ?,Project Manager,469
15,No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker .,Industrial Designer,470
15,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,471
15,"Right , okay .",Project Manager,472
15,"If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .",Industrial Designer,473
15,Well the kinetic is three .,Project Manager,474
15,If we change it to the battery it's {disfmarker} that's minus three .,Project Manager,474

15,"Oh , right .",Project Manager,476

15,{gap},User Interface,477
15,we can do {disfmarker} it doesn't have to be voice recognition .,Project Manager,478

15,Yeah .,Marketing,479
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,480
15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,481
15,You could choose to have that or not .,Project Manager,482
15,Sure .,Marketing,483

15,So should we just change the design specification then ?,Project Manager,486
15,{vocalsound},Project Manager,486
15,{vocalsound} Make it costly .,User Interface,487
15,We can put in our recommendations .,Marketing,488

15,Yes .,Project Manager,489
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,490
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,491
15,We c we could s,Industrial Designer,492
15,But we need to work to that specification to start with .,Marketing,493
15,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,494
15,"Yeah , we could say {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,495
15,"And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance .",Marketing,496
15,"Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers",Marketing,496
15,"Okay , we can make the price fit ,",Project Manager,497
15,"Yeah , I s",Industrial Designer,498
15,"and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this ,",Project Manager,499
15,And then say we recommend {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,500
15,Mm .,Marketing,501
15,because it also sets it apart from the crowd .,Project Manager,502
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,503

15,{vocalsound} Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ?,Marketing,519
15,Or point zero one of a Euro ?,Marketing,519

15,isn't it ?,Project Manager,521
15,Which is less than ten P_ .,Marketing,522

15,"because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship .",Industrial Designer,643
15,"They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,643
15,"Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah .",Marketing,644

15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,652
15,"you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being {disfmarker} a plastic was being made for you .",Project Manager,653
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,654
15,But people could {gap} have anything that they wanted .,Project Manager,655
15,Mm .,Industrial Designer,656
15,"Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .",User Interface,657
15,Because of the produ Mm .,Project Manager,658
15,"And new f television products coming up ,",User Interface,659

15,"I think it's really good that this has been very market research based ,",Marketing,662

15,"We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .",Marketing,664
15,There are innovations in that that people don't really want .,Marketing,664
15,Yes .,Project Manager,665
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,666
15,"{vocalsound} I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore",Marketing,667

15,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,670
15,"Well , it's innovation for money's sake .",Project Manager,671

15,Mm .,Marketing,678
15,Mm .,Marketing,678

15,Yes .,Project Manager,681
15,yeah .,Marketing,682
15,It's madness .,Project Manager,683
15,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,683

15,{gap},User Interface,686
15,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,687
15,"Um {vocalsound} our costs are below budget with recommendations that they {disfmarker} the budget be increased , but I think {disfmarker} I don't know , d what do you think ?",Project Manager,688
15,Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ?,Project Manager,688
15,"And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?",Project Manager,688
15,{vocalsound},User Interface,689
15,{vocalsound} Well .,Industrial Designer,690
15,I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .,Marketing,691
15,I think that was just the the physical .,Industrial Designer,692
15,"So it looks {disfmarker} well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that .",Project Manager,693
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,694
15,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,695
15,"So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at .",Project Manager,696
15,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,697
15,Maybe fifty percent more .,User Interface,698
15,But I think {disfmarker} but you were saying that that's quite {disfmarker},Project Manager,699
15,"Yeah , I think {disfmarker} yeah I don't {disfmarker} from the market research .",Industrial Designer,700

15,"I think we've done what we were required to do ,",Marketing,701
15,Hmm .,Project Manager,702
15,and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things .,Marketing,703
15,I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .,Marketing,703
15,Yeah .,Project Manager,704

16,"Nice , eh ?",Industrial Designer,192
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,192
16,Yep .,Marketing,193
16,"Yeah , thank you .",Project Manager,194
16,"Now we just have to save everything , so .",Project Manager,194
16,{vocalsound},Project Manager,194
16,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing,195
16,{vocalsound} Oh,Project Manager,196
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,197
16,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Marketing,198
16,this is definitely the best one .,Project Manager,199
16,{vocalsound},User Interface,200
16,Uh .,Industrial Designer,201
16,"Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros .",Project Manager,202
16,"Okay ,",Project Manager,202
16,Excuse me .,Industrial Designer,203
16,that's {gap} .,Project Manager,204
16,"And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe .",Project Manager,204
16,"The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,",Project Manager,204
16,Piece of cake .,User Interface,205
16,sorry .,Project Manager,206
16,Uh easy .,User Interface,207
16,"So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno .",Project Manager,208
16,"Uh so we're gonna have {gap} a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the {gap} and everything , so just have a look how it {disfmarker} we think about remote controls .",Project Manager,208
16,"Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a {vocalsound} a universal remote control ?",Marketing,209
16,"Oh yeah , that's a good question .",Project Manager,210
16,"Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .",Marketing,211
16,"I think it's {disfmarker} I'm not I'm not sure ,",Project Manager,212
16,So I {disfmarker},Marketing,213
16,it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker},Project Manager,214
16,"Yeah , it probably would be universal .",Industrial Designer,215
16,Universal .,User Interface,216
16,Because {disfmarker} {gap},Marketing,217
16,And only television ?,User Interface,218
16,Or more devices ?,User Interface,218
16,"I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so {disfmarker} not sure , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,219
16,"Hmm , maybe , I don't know .",Industrial Designer,220
16,"Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros",Marketing,221
16,"Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control .",Project Manager,222
16,"Okay , perfect .",Project Manager,222
16,Ah okay .,User Interface,223
16,"Yeah , I think .",Marketing,224
16,And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player,Industrial Designer,225
16,"Yeah , everything",Project Manager,226
16,and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,227
16,just {disfmarker} so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control .,Project Manager,228
16,okay .,Industrial Designer,229
16,"{vocalsound} Yeah , probably .",Industrial Designer,229
16,Not just a T_V_ .,User Interface,230
16,"No , just everything .",Project Manager,231
16,Okay .,User Interface,232
16,{gap} .,Project Manager,233
16,"so yeah ,",Project Manager,233
16,Okay .,Marketing,234
16,"what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not {disfmarker} nothing very special , but um {disfmarker}",Project Manager,235
16,Well we can try to make it special .,User Interface,236
16,"yeah , that's right .",Project Manager,237
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,238
16,{vocalsound},Marketing,239
16,So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound},Project Manager,240
16,Well {disfmarker},User Interface,241
16,"Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , {gap} {disfmarker} we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter .",Marketing,242
16,"{vocalsound} Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons .",Marketing,242
16,"Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh {vocalsound} use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .",Marketing,242
16,Hmm yeah .,Project Manager,243
16,{vocalsound},User Interface,244
16,That's right .,Project Manager,245
16,Should be a good point .,Project Manager,245
16,Yeah .,User Interface,246
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer,247
16,Nothing {gap} N,User Interface,248
16,And how big should it be ?,Industrial Designer,249
16,No .,Marketing,250
16,Yeah .,Marketing,250
16,"{gap} It shouldn't be too big ,",User Interface,251
16,I dunno um {disfmarker},Marketing,252
16,"but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .",User Interface,253
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,254
16,We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .,User Interface,255
16,"Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .",Project Manager,256
16,Yeah .,User Interface,257
16,Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .,User Interface,257
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,258
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,258
16,"Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,",User Interface,259
16,Yes,Marketing,260
16,maybe more trendy .,User Interface,261
16,But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open .,Project Manager,262
16,"Fold open ,",User Interface,263
16,"Okay ,",Project Manager,264
16,where you can see uh more options .,User Interface,265
16,I think {disfmarker},User Interface,265
16,"yeah , that's cool .",Project Manager,266
16,"Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something ,",Project Manager,266
16,Yeah,Industrial Designer,267
16,Ah,Marketing,268
16,n,Industrial Designer,269
16,that's that's {disfmarker},Marketing,270
16,if you just {disfmarker},Project Manager,271
16,"Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .",User Interface,272
16,Ah right right .,Marketing,273
16,"Yeah , or you c",Industrial Designer,274
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,275
16,O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .,Industrial Designer,276
16,"Oh that's good , yeah .",Marketing,277
16,Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker},User Interface,278
16,Yeah .,Marketing,279
16,Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?,Project Manager,280
16,{vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,281
16,There are buttons on it .,Project Manager,282
16,No you can make an uh manual in it .,User Interface,283
16,"Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .",Industrial Designer,284
16,Okay .,Project Manager,285
16,But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .,Project Manager,285
16,But that's {disfmarker},User Interface,286
16,Uh like a a to have {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,287
16,"Yeah , but",Marketing,288
16,"Yeah , I think it's much uh {disfmarker} too expensive .",User Interface,289
16,"Yeah , maybe it would .",Industrial Designer,290
16,"Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .",Marketing,291
16,{gap},Project Manager,292
16,"And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,",Marketing,293
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,294
16,because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .,Marketing,295
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,296
16,So .,Project Manager,296
16,"And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .",Project Manager,296
16,"Yeah , too fragile .",User Interface,297
16,Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker},Marketing,298
16,No .,Project Manager,299
16,You can put games on your remote control .,Project Manager,299
16,Whatever .,Project Manager,299
16,{vocalsound},Project Manager,299
16,Kid-proof .,Industrial Designer,300
16,{vocalsound},Marketing,301
16,{vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .,User Interface,302
16,{vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?,Industrial Designer,303
16,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,304
16,Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,305
16,"Oh maybe that's a good idea ,",Project Manager,306
16,Ma maybe a home station .,Marketing,307
16,"just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,",Project Manager,308
16,Yeah .,User Interface,309
16,you never have to use any batteries .,Project Manager,310
16,Mm yeah .,Industrial Designer,311
16,"Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .",User Interface,312
16,"Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?",Project Manager,313
16,Yeah .,Marketing,314
16,"Yeah , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,315
16,Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?,User Interface,316
16,I dunno .,Project Manager,317
16,"Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,",Industrial Designer,318
16,{vocalsound},Project Manager,319
16,Ah yeah .,Marketing,320
16,but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .,Industrial Designer,321
16,{gap},Marketing,322
16,Maybe have {gap} uh {disfmarker},User Interface,323
16,{vocalsound},Marketing,324
16,"Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .",Project Manager,325
16,"Yeah , 'cause well {disfmarker}",User Interface,326
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,327
16,"Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,",Marketing,328
16,"Yeah , that's right , yeah .",Project Manager,329
16,and now you can put it always at the same place .,Marketing,330
16,Yeah .,User Interface,331
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,332
16,"Maybe it's {disfmarker} Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .",Marketing,333
16,Maybe uh use it as a separate option .,User Interface,334
16,Sell it uh separately .,User Interface,334
16,Yeah .,Marketing,335
16,"You can {disfmarker} yeah , you can buy it with it .",Marketing,335
16,"Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,336
16,Rechargeable .,User Interface,337
16,"Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,",Industrial Designer,338
16,Yeah .,User Interface,339
16,"or you can change your batteries ,",Industrial Designer,340
16,Oh yeah .,Marketing,341
16,so .,Industrial Designer,342
16,"The option , just the option , that's cool .",Project Manager,343
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,344
16,"Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,",Marketing,345
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,346
16,"uh it has to lay good in the hand ,",Marketing,347
16,Yeah .,User Interface,348
16,you you have to uh {disfmarker},Marketing,349
16,Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control,Project Manager,350
16,"Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know",Marketing,351
16,or {disfmarker},Project Manager,352
16,"Well I think we have to look at that ,",User Interface,353
16,if we {disfmarker},Marketing,354
16,"'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}",User Interface,355
16,"You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,",Marketing,356
16,Yeah,Project Manager,357
16,but it's very hard to {disfmarker},Marketing,358
16,"N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .",Industrial Designer,359
16,"Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .",User Interface,360
16,Nah .,Marketing,361
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,362
16,"But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .",User Interface,363
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,364
16,"So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,",User Interface,365
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,366
16,so you can do something unique with that .,User Interface,367
16,"And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .",Industrial Designer,368
16,"Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .",Marketing,369
16,"Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .",Project Manager,370
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,371
16,"Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,",Marketing,372
16,But n {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,373
16,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,374
16,"yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,",Industrial Designer,375
16,and if you fold it open {disfmarker},Marketing,376
16,But maybe it's,Project Manager,377
16,Yeah {gap} .,User Interface,378
16,{gap},Marketing,379
16,That's what I meant .,User Interface,380
16,so .,Industrial Designer,381
16,maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ?,Project Manager,382
16,Mm .,Marketing,383
16,If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .,Marketing,383
16,{gap} Maybe it's hard t,Project Manager,384
16,Uh {disfmarker},User Interface,385
16,"No , that's right .",Project Manager,386
16,"So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} .",Project Manager,386
16,"Okay , but yeah .",User Interface,387
16,Just think about it .,Project Manager,388
16,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,389
16,"We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so .",Project Manager,390
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer,391
16,There's some more things .,Project Manager,392
16,"We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again .",Project Manager,392
16,So you know what you have to {disfmarker} what you have to do ?,Project Manager,392
16,Okay .,Marketing,393
16,Yeah .,Project Manager,394
16,"Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the {disfmarker}",Marketing,395
16,"{vocalsound} No , what you want to do with it .",User Interface,396
16,"Yeah , I think this {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things .",Project Manager,397
16,"Also from a user , but all these things together .",Project Manager,397
16,Okay .,Marketing,398
16,"Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh .",Marketing,398
16,"Yeah , everything .",Project Manager,399
16,"Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff",User Interface,400
16,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,401
16,that you want on a {disfmarker},User Interface,402
16,"no maybe not not uh {gap} , that's not a f that's something for for for {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,403
16,Technical fun fu,User Interface,404
16,That's not for you .,Project Manager,405
16,Just if {disfmarker},Project Manager,405
16,Okay .,Marketing,406
16,"what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .",Project Manager,407
16,"What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .",User Interface,408
16,"Yeah , it's alright .",Project Manager,409
16,"I already wrote some down , some ideas .",User Interface,410
16,Yep .,Marketing,411
16,"Yeah , just {disfmarker} is that okay ?",Project Manager,412
16,Yep .,User Interface,413
16,Okay .,Marketing,414
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer,415
16,Okay .,Project Manager,416
16,There's already a document in the folder about it .,User Interface,417
16,"Yeah , me too .",Marketing,418
16,So see you in thirty minutes .,Project Manager,419
16,Okay .,User Interface,420
16,"Okay , well done .",Marketing,421
16,Okay .,Industrial Designer,422
16,"For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so {disfmarker} your laptop .",Project Manager,423
16,I will .,User Interface,424
16,Oh Paul .,Marketing,425
16,{vocalsound},Marketing,425
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,426
16,{vocalsound},Project Manager,427
16,It didn't say that .,User Interface,428
16,"No , sorry .",Project Manager,429
16,Your fault .,User Interface,430
16,Ciao .,Marketing,431
16,{vocalsound},User Interface,432
16,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,433
16,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bye bye .,Marketing,434
16,Bye bye .,User Interface,435
17,"So , I will open our functional design meeting .",Project Manager,1
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,2
17,"So , I will play role of the secretary .",Project Manager,3
17,As also Program Ma Manager .,Project Manager,3
17,"So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um",Project Manager,3
17,Industrial Design .,Industrial Designer,4
17,Marketing Expert .,Marketing,5
17,What's your talk ?,Project Manager,6
17,Okay .,User Interface,7
17,Marketing Experts .,Project Manager,8
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,8
17,Mm .,Marketing,9
17,"And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after .",Project Manager,10
17,Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .,Project Manager,10
17,Okay .,User Interface,11
17,"Um , so you're participant two ?",Project Manager,12
17,One one .,Industrial Designer,13
17,No no no .,User Interface,14
17,No you're {disfmarker},Project Manager,15
17,One .,User Interface,16
17,"No ,",Project Manager,17
17,"Three three , it's three",Industrial Designer,18
17,I'm participant one .,Project Manager,19
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,19
17,sorry {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,20
17,I I think I'm a {gap} .,User Interface,21
17,"Okay , never mind .",Project Manager,22
17,Okay .,Marketing,23
17,"'Kay , did you save your presentation ?",Project Manager,24
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,24
17,In one .,User Interface,25
17,"In one , sorry {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,26
17,Yeah .,Marketing,27
17,Isn't that technical functions ?,Project Manager,28
17,No sure .,Marketing,29
17,So you didn't save it maybe .,Industrial Designer,30
17,Uh,Marketing,31
17,It's mine .,User Interface,32
17,it's David Jordan .,Marketing,33
17,Course .,Marketing,33
17,"Alright , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,34
17,{vocalsound} Name's Jordan .,Project Manager,35
17,So,Project Manager,35
17,David Jordan ?,Industrial Designer,36
17,{vocalsound} Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,36
17,Mm yeah .,User Interface,37
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,38
17,so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .,Project Manager,39
17,Okay .,User Interface,40
17,"No , no .",Marketing,41
17,"Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .",Marketing,41
17,Uh .,Project Manager,42
17,Too great for email then .,Industrial Designer,43
17,"Okay , so .",User Interface,44
17,The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .,User Interface,44
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,45
17,Uh I I will focus on user interface design .,User Interface,46
17,Mm .,Project Manager,47
17,Um so move to the next slide .,User Interface,48
17,"As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .",User Interface,48
17,There's a lot of functions .,User Interface,48
17,"Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control .",User Interface,48
17,So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?,User Interface,48
17,"Um , let's move to next slide .",User Interface,48
17,Um .,User Interface,48
17,Yeah .,User Interface,48
17,"So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .",User Interface,48
17,A very good example is Google .,User Interface,48
17,"As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .",User Interface,48
17,Um so move to next s slide .,User Interface,48
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,49
17,So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .,User Interface,50
17,So {disfmarker},User Interface,50
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,51
17,That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation .,User Interface,52
17,So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .,Project Manager,53
17,"Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions ,",User Interface,54
17,"So powerful ,",Project Manager,55
17,but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful .,User Interface,56
17,many functions and very easy to use .,Project Manager,57
17,Yes .,User Interface,58
17,Yep .,User Interface,58
17,"So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,",Marketing,59
17,To merge the two system huh .,Industrial Designer,60
17,I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple,Marketing,61
17,Yeah .,User Interface,62
17,Yeah .,Marketing,63
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,64
17,You mean this one ?,Project Manager,65
17,Yeah .,Marketing,66
17,"Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .",Project Manager,67
17,Mm yep .,Industrial Designer,68
17,{gap},Marketing,69
17,But But this is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,70
17,But if we have very very good user interface,User Interface,71
17,"Yeah ,",Marketing,72
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,73
17,and then {disfmarker},Marketing,74
17,it take less time for user to learn how to use it .,User Interface,75
17,Yeah .,Marketing,76
17,"Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign .",Industrial Designer,77
17,Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?,Project Manager,78
17,"Yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,79
17,"For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .",Industrial Designer,79
17,"Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah .",Marketing,80
17,The user should know .,Marketing,80
17,"So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So .",Industrial Designer,81
17,Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker},Project Manager,82
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,83
17,So .,Industrial Designer,83
17,"Go on , go back and {disfmarker}",Project Manager,84
17,"Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .",Industrial Designer,85
17,"Yeah , that's gonna be the trick .",Marketing,86
17,{vocalsound},Marketing,86
17,"Yeah , that's my job .",User Interface,87
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,87
17,{vocalsound} That's your job {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,88
17,That's my job .,User Interface,89
17,It's not the easiest I've got to .,User Interface,89
17,{vocalsound},Marketing,90
17,It you {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,91
17,"So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use .",Project Manager,92
17,Yep .,User Interface,93
17,Okay .,Marketing,94
17,Okay .,Project Manager,95
17,Powerful and easy to use .,User Interface,96
17,So that's the point .,Marketing,97
17,"Yeah , that's the point .",User Interface,98
17,"So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .",Project Manager,99
17,"Okay , okay .",Industrial Designer,100
17,So you you're {disfmarker},Project Manager,101
17,Participant two .,Industrial Designer,102
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,102
17,Um .,Project Manager,103
17,Okay .,Project Manager,103
17,{gap},Marketing,104
17,"{vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,105
17,"So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer .",Project Manager,106
17,Okay .,Project Manager,106
17,So we can move to the next slide .,Industrial Designer,107
17,"As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .",Industrial Designer,107
17,"So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the",Industrial Designer,107
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,108
17,"how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ .",Industrial Designer,109
17,"So , this one is leather bu based",Industrial Designer,109
17,Mm .,Marketing,110
17,"but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_",Industrial Designer,111
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,112
17,{vocalsound},Marketing,113
17,"so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,114
17,True .,Marketing,115
17,So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?,Project Manager,116
17,"I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,117
17,Okay .,Marketing,118
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,119
17,Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?,Project Manager,119
17,"Twelve , nearly thirteen ,",Project Manager,119
17,What the cost is ?,Marketing,120
17,yeah .,Project Manager,121
17,The cost {disfmarker},Project Manager,121
17,"Twelve , twelve a half .",Marketing,122
17,"Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see .",Industrial Designer,123
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,123
17,"You can move to the next slide , so .",Industrial Designer,123
17,"So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here",Industrial Designer,123
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,124
17,and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .,Industrial Designer,125
17,That might just {disfmarker} So .,Marketing,126
17,You can go to the next slide .,Industrial Designer,127
17,Okay .,Project Manager,128
17,"I have some kind of pictures you know , here .",Industrial Designer,129
17,"You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff",Industrial Designer,129
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,130
17,"you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .",Industrial Designer,131
17,What is this ?,Project Manager,132
17,This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .,Industrial Designer,133
17,Okay .,Project Manager,134
17,Look .,Industrial Designer,135
17,But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .,Industrial Designer,135
17,Okay .,Project Manager,136
17,"So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .",Industrial Designer,137
17,"Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .",Industrial Designer,137
17,Okay .,Project Manager,138
17,Okay .,Marketing,139
17,"Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?",Industrial Designer,140
17,What's the average price of this technology then ?,Marketing,141
17,"Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so .",Industrial Designer,142
17,"Or at least you know , the",Industrial Designer,142
17,"So what , the wireless remote control ?",User Interface,143
17,There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ?,User Interface,143
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,143
17,"{vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can .",Industrial Designer,144
17,"It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so .",Industrial Designer,144
17,"We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire .",Industrial Designer,144
17,We can have both also .,Industrial Designer,144
17,Okay .,User Interface,145
17,So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .,Project Manager,146
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,147
17,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface,148
17,Okay .,User Interface,148
17,"{vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu",Project Manager,149
17,But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker},Marketing,150
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,151
17,"{vocalsound} Yeah ,",Project Manager,152
17,{vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .,User Interface,153
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,154
17,"I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,",Marketing,155
17,"Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,",Industrial Designer,156
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,157
17,but in a sense {disfmarker},Marketing,158
17,sometime I want to have wire because you know .,Industrial Designer,159
17,"Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?",Project Manager,160
17,{gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,161
17,{vocalsound} I'm just asking you .,Project Manager,162
17,Do you think it will be cheaper ?,Project Manager,162
17,"Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .",Industrial Designer,163
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,164
17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,165
17,{vocalsound} Could you answer please ?,Project Manager,166
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,166
17,Okay .,User Interface,167
17,"Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,168
17,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,169
17,"{vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .",Industrial Designer,170
17,"Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .",Project Manager,171
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,172
17,The wire ?,Marketing,173
17,As it's {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,174
17,Yeah .,Marketing,175
17,True .,Marketing,175
17,"Okay , yeah .",Industrial Designer,176
17,I think it's more your problem .,Project Manager,177
17,Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .,Project Manager,177
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,178
17,Uh that's my job .,Marketing,179
17,That's the {disfmarker},Marketing,179
17,"{vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .",Project Manager,180
17,Now the {disfmarker},Marketing,181
17,So {disfmarker},Project Manager,182
17,"Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know .",Industrial Designer,183
17,"If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .",Industrial Designer,183
17,{vocalsound} So,Project Manager,184
17,Okay .,User Interface,185
17,just think of um the usability .,Project Manager,186
17,Design a wireless remote control .,User Interface,187
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,187
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,188
17,Just think of the problem .,Project Manager,188
17,If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?,Project Manager,188
17,Yeah .,User Interface,189
17,Yeah .,Marketing,190
17,"I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,",Project Manager,191
17,"Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ?",Marketing,192
17,True .,Marketing,192
17,yeah .,Project Manager,193
17,This you will see in my presentation then .,Marketing,194
17,"{vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .",Project Manager,195
17,Yeah .,Marketing,196
17,Okay {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,197
17,Which is participant four .,Marketing,198
17,"So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh .",Marketing,198
17,"We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .",Marketing,198
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,199
17,Sorry for the functional recurrence .,Marketing,200
17,"So that's the standard method for marketing , okay .",Marketing,200
17,"We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .",Marketing,200
17,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,201
17,Okay .,Marketing,202
17,So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered .,Marketing,202
17,"Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}",Marketing,202
17,"You mean the loo the look , the outside ?",Project Manager,203
17,"The look , how it look like .",Industrial Designer,204
17,"Yeah , the the look is is bad for them",Marketing,205
17,Okay .,Project Manager,206
17,"so uh it's your job , David , maybe .",Marketing,207
17,Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .,Marketing,207
17,"So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .",Marketing,207
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,208
17,"So it's it's interesting information , I think .",Marketing,209
17,"And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on .",Marketing,209
17,So we should change this as well .,Marketing,209
17,"And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well .",Marketing,209
17,"And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .",Marketing,209
17,And uh this is one of the main point for me .,Marketing,209
17,But I'll come back to it later .,Marketing,209
17,'Kay .,Marketing,209
17,Could you go next slide ?,Marketing,209
17,"Uh , so as you said uh ,",Marketing,209
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,210
17,remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .,Marketing,211
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,212
17,"So this is from the experiments we've done ,",Marketing,213
17,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Project Manager,214
17,"so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .",Marketing,215
17,Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .,Marketing,215
17,And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .,Marketing,215
17,{vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ?,Project Manager,216
17,"R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .",Marketing,217
17,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,218
17,Ah um okay .,Project Manager,219
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,219
17,Okay ?,Marketing,220
17,"So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count .",Marketing,220
17,So last slide .,Marketing,220
17,Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .,Marketing,220
17,"If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .",Marketing,220
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer,221
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,222
17,"And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,",Marketing,223
17,Functions .,User Interface,224
17,this would definitely be a good way of selling more .,Marketing,225
17,Okay .,Marketing,225
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer,226
17,So {disfmarker},Marketing,227
17,Mm okay .,Project Manager,228
17,"And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?",Project Manager,228
17,Yeah .,User Interface,229
17,Sure ?,Project Manager,230
17,Yeah ?,Project Manager,230
17,"Yeah , I think possible .",User Interface,231
17,Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .,User Interface,231
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,232
17,So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .,User Interface,233
17,"Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?",Project Manager,234
17,But I'm not sure {disfmarker},User Interface,235
17,Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .,Project Manager,236
17,"Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the",Marketing,237
17,The manuals .,Industrial Designer,238
17,"Yeah ,",Project Manager,239
17,manual .,Marketing,240
17,I think the {disfmarker},Project Manager,241
17,It's {disfmarker},Marketing,242
17,"No you you can have a switch menu , so you can",User Interface,243
17,"Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .",Project Manager,244
17,"well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,245
17,Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes .,User Interface,245
17,"Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .",User Interface,245
17,"Yeah , okay .",Project Manager,246
17,"Okay ,",Project Manager,246
17,"Then you you put the switch button ,",User Interface,247
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,248
17,then it switch to another category of functions .,User Interface,249
17,Yeah .,User Interface,249
17,"For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .",User Interface,249
17,With a {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,250
17,"So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder .",User Interface,251
17,So we can has less buttons .,User Interface,251
17,"Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Project Manager,252
17,"But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny .",User Interface,253
17,Look fancy .,Industrial Designer,254
17,{gap},Marketing,255
17,"This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} .",Industrial Designer,256
17,Because different people have a different opinion about fancy .,User Interface,257
17,You know .,User Interface,257
17,Yeah .,Marketing,258
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,259
17,"Yeah , this is something we sh",Marketing,260
17,"Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so .",User Interface,261
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,262
17,"But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .",Marketing,263
17,I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,264
17,"Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .",Project Manager,265
17,"Specially distribution , yeah .",Marketing,266
17,"Yeah , yeah , maybe .",Industrial Designer,267
17,"Yeah , maybe .",Industrial Designer,267
17,If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .,Project Manager,268
17,Uh {disfmarker},Marketing,269
17,"Yeah , personalised colour .",User Interface,270
17,Because you know {disfmarker},User Interface,270
17,"Yeah , it will cost little bit more .",Project Manager,271
17,"Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,",User Interface,272
17,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,273
17,some people prefer black remote control .,User Interface,274
17,"Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .",Marketing,275
17,And also f,Project Manager,276
17,"Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,",User Interface,277
17,Yeah .,Marketing,278
17,"so user can select which colour they prefer , so .",User Interface,279
17,"Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,",Project Manager,280
17,"Yeah ,",Marketing,281
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,282
17,remember it's twelve Euros .,Marketing,283
17,"and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it .",Project Manager,284
17,"So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .",Project Manager,284
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,285
17,Hmm .,Marketing,286
17,"And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .",Project Manager,287
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,288
17,So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about,Project Manager,289
17,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,290
17,and to discuss it with uh the other members .,Project Manager,291
17,"Yeah , hmm .",Industrial Designer,292
17,Yeah .,User Interface,293
17,"So , is it okay for your presentation ?",Project Manager,294
17,Nothing else to to add ?,Project Manager,294
17,"Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah .",Marketing,295
17,"If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .",Marketing,295
17,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,296
17,Okay .,Project Manager,296
17,Mm so {disfmarker},Project Manager,296
17,So .,Marketing,297
17,"So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control .",Project Manager,298
17,"So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}",Project Manager,298
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,299
17,It's is uh {disfmarker},Project Manager,300
17,"Lame , or {disfmarker}",Marketing,301
17,"No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .",Project Manager,302
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,303
17,Yeah .,User Interface,303
17,"So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,",Project Manager,304
17,Yep .,Industrial Designer,305
17,"and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .",Project Manager,306
17,Control .,User Interface,307
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,307
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,307
17,It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,308
17,Mm-hmm,Marketing,309
17,because if we want to to do remote control,Project Manager,310
17,Mm .,User Interface,311
17,"which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that .",Project Manager,312
17,We really want to focus on the remote control for the television .,Project Manager,312
17,Is it okay ?,Project Manager,312
17,Okay .,User Interface,313
17,But there's balance between function and the cost .,User Interface,313
17,"So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .",Project Manager,314
17,Yeah .,User Interface,315
17,Okay .,User Interface,315
17,"And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .",Project Manager,316
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,317
17,Yeah .,Marketing,318
17,I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .,Project Manager,319
17,Mm-hm .,User Interface,320
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,321
17,"So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um",Project Manager,322
17,Okay .,User Interface,323
17,of the uh of real reaction,Project Manager,324
17,Okay .,User Interface,325
17,So .,Industrial Designer,326
17,and uh also {disfmarker},Project Manager,327
17,So has to be yellow .,Marketing,328
17,Yellow .,Industrial Designer,329
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,330
17,"As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control .",Project Manager,330
17,"Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .",Project Manager,330
17,Okay .,User Interface,331
17,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,331
17,"Require lot of requirements ,",Project Manager,332
17,"{vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah .",Industrial Designer,333
17,but {disfmarker},Project Manager,334
17,Yeah .,User Interface,335
17,And cheap .,User Interface,335
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,336
17,A low cost .,User Interface,337
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,338
17,But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .,Project Manager,338
17,{vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,339
17,"Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .",Industrial Designer,339
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,340
17,This is {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,341
17,I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .,Marketing,342
17,"Maybe not ,",Project Manager,343
17,It's maybe more in browsing .,Marketing,344
17,but mayb,Project Manager,345
17,"Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .",Industrial Designer,346
17,"Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it .",User Interface,347
17,Yeah .,Marketing,348
17,"A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .",User Interface,349
17,Okay .,Industrial Designer,350
17,Ok,User Interface,351
17,Hm-mm .,Marketing,352
17,It's It's not so uh popular now .,User Interface,353
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,353
17,"It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so .",Industrial Designer,354
17,You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know,Industrial Designer,354
17,Mm .,User Interface,355
17,"the global usage ,",Industrial Designer,356
17,"Global ,",User Interface,357
17,so if people don't have the technology .,Industrial Designer,358
17,okay .,User Interface,359
17,So .,Project Manager,360
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,361
17,So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?,Project Manager,362
17,"So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?",User Interface,363
17,I think it has to be yellow .,Project Manager,364
17,{vocalsound} Yellow ?,Industrial Designer,365
17,Do you think that people like the colour yellow ?,Industrial Designer,365
17,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,365
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,366
17,Yellow ?,User Interface,367
17,{gap} T_V_ remote control ?,User Interface,367
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,367
17,Min,Marketing,368
17,"Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .",Project Manager,369
17,Okay .,User Interface,370
17,Okay .,User Interface,370
17,Yeah .,Marketing,371
17,I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ .,Industrial Designer,372
17,Or should be .,Industrial Designer,372
17,Why you go {disfmarker} It has to be fashion .,Project Manager,373
17,"Yeah , so .",Industrial Designer,374
17,"Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,",Industrial Designer,374
17,So you have to {disfmarker},Project Manager,375
17,Okay .,User Interface,376
17,but just mm .,Industrial Designer,377
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,378
17,It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society .,Project Manager,378
17,"Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction .",Project Manager,378
17,"Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .",Project Manager,378
17,"Okay , okay .",User Interface,379
17,Okay .,User Interface,379
17,"And also it has to be attractive , of course ,",Project Manager,380
17,Mm .,User Interface,381
17,because if you want to sale {disfmarker} to sell the remote control .,Project Manager,382
17,It's okay ?,Project Manager,382
17,"Regarding the first line , what {disfmarker} So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .",Marketing,383
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,384
17,And that's it .,Marketing,385
17,Yeah .,Project Manager,386
17,"But {disfmarker} I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .",Industrial Designer,387
17,It's already changed for {disfmarker},Marketing,388
17,I think it would be simpler .,Project Manager,389
17,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,390
17,Okay .,Project Manager,391
17,"So {disfmarker} I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break .",Project Manager,391
17,And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .,Project Manager,391
17,Uh {disfmarker} Y you {disfmarker} You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um {disfmarker} pon,Project Manager,391
17,Industrial Designer .,Marketing,392
17,"Industrial Designer , yeah .",Industrial Designer,393
17,"Component component , yeah .",Industrial Designer,393
17,"yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .",Project Manager,394
17,Okay .,User Interface,395
17,And Florent to work my subject .,Project Manager,396
17,Yep .,Marketing,397
17,And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .,Project Manager,398
17,Okay .,Marketing,399
17,It's okay ?,Project Manager,400
17,Yeah .,Marketing,401
17,I think the um session is closed .,Project Manager,402
17,Good .,Industrial Designer,403
17,"And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder .",Project Manager,404
17,{vocalsound} Not in mine .,Project Manager,404
17,"Okay {vocalsound} Okay , that's clear .",Industrial Designer,405
17,Okay {vocalsound} .,User Interface,406
17,Okay .,User Interface,406
17,{vocalsound},User Interface,406
17,Should be better .,Project Manager,407
17,{vocalsound},Project Manager,407
18,'Kay .,Project Manager,1
18,Hmm .,Project Manager,1
18,Okay everybody .,Project Manager,1
18,Welcome to the detailed design meeting .,Project Manager,1
18,Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see .,Project Manager,1
18,Our agenda .,Project Manager,1
18,Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that .,Project Manager,1
18,Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas .,Project Manager,1
18,Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary .,Project Manager,1
18,Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that .,Project Manager,1
18,Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it .,Project Manager,1
18,Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,1
18,Okay well um .,Industrial Designer,2
18,So our design looks something like this .,Industrial Designer,2
18,This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .,Industrial Designer,2
18,"This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu .",Industrial Designer,2
18,"And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .",Industrial Designer,2
18,"So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever .",Industrial Designer,2
18,And it comes {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,2
18,"You could change the vegetable , or fruit .",User Interface,3
18,"yeah , I can change the vegetable .",Industrial Designer,4
18,Oh is that broccoli ?,Project Manager,5
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,5
18,This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .,Industrial Designer,6
18,Yeah .,User Interface,7
18,So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .,Industrial Designer,8
18,This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .,Industrial Designer,8
18,This is a mango .,Industrial Designer,8
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,9
18,"The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .",Industrial Designer,10
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,11
18,"You don't have orange , you have mango .",Industrial Designer,12
18,"Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,12
18,'S a very bright strawberry .,Project Manager,13
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,13
18,So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .,Industrial Designer,14
18,"And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .",Industrial Designer,14
18,It's been a l,User Interface,15
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,16
18,"It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big .",User Interface,17
18,"Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .",User Interface,17
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,18
18,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,19
18,"And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator .",User Interface,20
18,How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker},User Interface,20
18,Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .,Industrial Designer,21
18,Okay so that's just {disfmarker},User Interface,22
18,And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere,Industrial Designer,23
18,So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker},User Interface,24
18,Yeah we didn't design that .,Industrial Designer,25
18,Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .,User Interface,26
18,But it would be coordinating with that of course .,Industrial Designer,27
18,Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .,User Interface,28
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,29
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,30
18,"You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango .",User Interface,31
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,31
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,32
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,33
18,So .,User Interface,34
18,Tada .,User Interface,34
18,Oh .,Project Manager,35
18,"Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet .",Project Manager,35
18,"Um the only one that's in there , production costs .",Project Manager,35
18,And if you open it up .,Project Manager,35
18,"Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there .",Project Manager,35
18,"{vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}",Project Manager,35
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,36
18,"I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button .",Project Manager,37
18,Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat .,Project Manager,37
18,"I think that's what you have there , is that right ?",Project Manager,37
18,For the for the plastic part would be {disfmarker},Project Manager,37
18,My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .,Industrial Designer,38
18,Oh .,Project Manager,39
18,Okay .,Project Manager,39
18,"But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means .",Industrial Designer,40
18,Right .,Project Manager,41
18,One side is curved and then the other side is curved .,Industrial Designer,42
18,Well {disfmarker} yeah .,Project Manager,43
18,If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno .,Project Manager,43
18,I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .,Project Manager,43
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,44
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,45
18,Um so what else ?,Project Manager,46
18,There's plastic for that area around the button .,Project Manager,46
18,Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?,Project Manager,46
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,47
18,Um and lots of special colours actually .,Project Manager,48
18,{vocalsound} Uh scroll wheel .,Project Manager,48
18,Do you see anything that I've missed ?,Project Manager,48
18,No I think that's alright .,Industrial Designer,49
18,"Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .",Project Manager,50
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,51
18,And if we sold a lot of squishy things .,Project Manager,52
18,Mm .,User Interface,53
18,Boo yeah .,Project Manager,54
18,Okay .,Project Manager,54
18,{vocalsound} S So {disfmarker} Mm .,Project Manager,54
18,Did y what did you work on ?,Project Manager,54
18,The {disfmarker},Project Manager,54
18,Um evaluation criteria .,Marketing,55
18,Okay .,Project Manager,56
18,Do you wanna {disfmarker},Project Manager,56
18,I've got a presentation .,Marketing,57
18,Okay .,Project Manager,58
18,I think that's {disfmarker},Project Manager,58
18,So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ?,Marketing,59
18,Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .,Marketing,59
18,Um .,Marketing,59
18,Right .,Marketing,59
18,This doesn't {disfmarker} okay .,Marketing,59
18,Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .,Marketing,59
18,"And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down .",Marketing,59
18,"Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .",Marketing,59
18,"These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .",Marketing,59
18,"We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .",Marketing,59
18,And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .,Marketing,59
18,And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .,Marketing,59
18,I would like to show you the table we have to use .,Marketing,59
18,Um .,Marketing,59
18,No .,Marketing,59
18,This is the table .,Marketing,59
18,Can you see this here ?,Marketing,59
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,60
18,Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ?,Marketing,61
18,True is one and and false is seven .,Marketing,61
18,"And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully .",Marketing,61
18,Um .,Marketing,61
18,I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .,Marketing,61
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,62
18,"I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .",Marketing,63
18,Yeah .,User Interface,64
18,Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own {disfmarker} {gap},User Interface,64
18,Yeah it's in the um {disfmarker} it's in the project documents .,Marketing,65
18,Is it meeting three minutes ?,User Interface,66
18,No it's not minutes .,User Interface,66
18,It's called evaluation criteria .,Marketing,67
18,Okay .,User Interface,68
18,And it's under evaluation .,Marketing,69
18,"Huh , the PowerPoint one ?",Project Manager,70
18,Hmm ?,Industrial Designer,71
18,Okay .,User Interface,72
18,Cool .,User Interface,72
18,Yeah .,Marketing,73
18,You've found it all ?,Marketing,73
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,74
18,So it was um {disfmarker} Yeah true's one .,Marketing,75
18,True's one and false is seven .,User Interface,76
18,Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?,Marketing,77
18,Um we can do it separately and then discuss it,Project Manager,78
18,{vocalsound} Yeah okay .,Marketing,79
18,if if that's what people wanna do .,Project Manager,80
18,So it's actually a scale .,User Interface,81
18,"Wait , one is true and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager,82
18,"{vocalsound} Um ,",Marketing,83
18,so these are the questions we're answering .,Project Manager,84
18,And one is {disfmarker},Project Manager,84
18,"yes it's {disfmarker} if it's fancy you put one ,",Marketing,85
18,"One , right okay .",Project Manager,86
18,if it's really unfancy it's seven .,Marketing,87
18,If it's somewhere in between you put four .,Project Manager,88
18,"{vocalsound} Yeah , something .",Marketing,89
18,{vocalsound} Okay .,Project Manager,90
18,Okay .,User Interface,91
18,{vocalsound} Does it feel fancy ?,User Interface,91
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,92
18,{vocalsound} Feels like play-dough .,Industrial Designer,93
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,94
18,{vocalsound} No .,User Interface,95
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,95
18,They shouldn't really be questions .,Marketing,96
18,Should be more like {disfmarker} Are the batteries easy to insert ?,Marketing,96
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,96
18,I'm gonna say yes .,Industrial Designer,97
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,97
18,Yes ?,Marketing,98
18,Very very true .,Marketing,98
18,Okay .,Marketing,98
18,{vocalsound} I imagine they're somewhere on the front .,Industrial Designer,99
18,We have a little case that you slip 'em in .,Industrial Designer,99
18,Okay .,Marketing,100
18,Are we just about ready ?,Project Manager,101
18,Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard .,Marketing,102
18,Do we {disfmarker} um is it necessary ?,Marketing,102
18,I don't think so .,Project Manager,103
18,It's {disfmarker},Project Manager,103
18,We'll just do um {disfmarker},Marketing,104
18,yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we {disfmarker},Project Manager,105

18,Is that what the company does ?,Marketing,129
18,I I think we should {disfmarker},Project Manager,130
18,{vocalsound} It's four if you wanna do that .,Industrial Designer,131
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,132
18,Yeah ?,Marketing,133
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,134
18,"It adds to sixteen , so that's four .",Industrial Designer,135
18,Oh no .,Marketing,136
18,It adds to thirteen .,Marketing,136
18,One five five two .,Marketing,136
18,Oh I thought she said five .,Industrial Designer,137
18,Hmm .,User Interface,138

18,I thought it was the other way round too .,Industrial Designer,157
18,"{vocalsound} So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",Project Manager,158
18,Well uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing,159

18,One .,Project Manager,187
18,One .,Industrial Designer,188
18,Ha .,Marketing,189
18,{vocalsound} Two point one ?,Marketing,189
18,Two .,Project Manager,190
18,Uh two .,User Interface,191
18,Uh two .,Industrial Designer,192
18,Two point {disfmarker} I think I missed two .,Project Manager,193
18,"{vocalsound} Wait , is that two point one ?",Project Manager,193
18,Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .,Industrial Designer,194
18,Yeah .,Marketing,195
18,"One point four , one point five .",Project Manager,196
18,Okay right,Project Manager,196
18,"Oh dear , okay .",Marketing,197
18,Sorry .,Marketing,197
18,that's {disfmarker} I have two of them .,Project Manager,198
18,Mine has all kinds of problems .,Industrial Designer,199
18,Two and one .,Marketing,200
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,201
18,Sorry about that .,Marketing,202
18,"T two point two , which is one point five .",Marketing,202
18,One .,Project Manager,203
18,Uh three .,Industrial Designer,204
18,Wait why did I put three ?,Industrial Designer,204
18,Uh one .,User Interface,205
18,I meant one on mine too .,Industrial Designer,206
18,Okay .,Marketing,207
18,Three point one .,Marketing,207
18,Is that correct on my slide ?,Marketing,207
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,208
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,208
18,Yeah .,User Interface,209
18,Yeah ?,Marketing,210
18,Uh one .,User Interface,211
18,Three point one .,Industrial Designer,212
18,I have four .,Industrial Designer,212
18,Three .,Project Manager,213
18,"One , four , three , three , three point two ?",Marketing,214
18,Three .,Industrial Designer,215
18,Three .,Project Manager,216
18,Uh .,User Interface,217
18,One .,User Interface,217
18,Three point three .,Marketing,218
18,One .,User Interface,219
18,One .,Industrial Designer,220
18,Two .,Project Manager,221
18,Four point one ?,Marketing,222
18,One .,User Interface,223
18,Two .,Industrial Designer,224
18,Five .,Project Manager,225
18,Two .,Marketing,226
18,Four point two .,Marketing,226
18,Two .,User Interface,227
18,Three .,Industrial Designer,228
18,Four .,Project Manager,229
18,Two and four point three .,Marketing,230
18,Two .,Industrial Designer,231
18,"One , two .",Marketing,232
18,One .,User Interface,233
18,Two .,Project Manager,234
18,Right so I put one on that .,Marketing,235
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,236
18,Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .,Marketing,237
18,Okay .,Project Manager,238
18,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,238
18,Or is it tedious ?,Marketing,239
18,I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .,Marketing,239
18,"No no that's um {disfmarker} I think we should look at the ones that {vocalsound} like where s where people said four , where {disfmarker} um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .",Project Manager,240
18,I didn't know how else to do it .,Marketing,241
18,Okay .,Marketing,241
18,Well the worst ones were three point one .,Marketing,241
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,242
18,Do {disfmarker} does every ones have the slide ?,Marketing,243
18,The {disfmarker},Project Manager,244
18,Three point one .,Marketing,245
18,that was material .,Project Manager,246
18,Slide show .,Marketing,247
18,"Material {vocalsound} technologically innovative , okay .",Marketing,247
18,"Um ,",Marketing,247
18,Mm .,Project Manager,248
18,do you want to change it ?,Marketing,249
18,What are the suggestions ?,Marketing,249
18,"I don't know , anyone ?",Marketing,249
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,249
18,Um {disfmarker},Project Manager,250
18,Which one is that again sorry ?,User Interface,251
18,Three point one ?,User Interface,251
18,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,252
18,Yeah that {disfmarker} it's three point one was not that good .,Marketing,253
18,Four point one .,Marketing,253
18,Does the shape {disfmarker},Project Manager,254
18,The shape .,Marketing,255
18,I think {disfmarker},User Interface,256
18,Four point two ?,Marketing,257
18,"See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the {disfmarker} is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ?",Project Manager,258
18,It {disfmarker} or bigger ?,Project Manager,258
18,I think the wheel would probably be {disfmarker} mm .,Industrial Designer,259
18,Because {disfmarker},Project Manager,260
18,What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?,User Interface,261
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,262
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,263
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,264
18,And like then it {disfmarker} you could hold it in your hand better .,User Interface,265
18,"I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold .",Industrial Designer,266
18,They're kinda smallish .,Industrial Designer,266
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,267
18,"No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get {disfmarker} that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of {disfmarker}",Project Manager,267
18,Yeah .,User Interface,268
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,269
18,The flat one .,User Interface,270
18,Yeah .,User Interface,270
18,so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .,Project Manager,271
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,272
18,Yeah .,User Interface,273
18,"{vocalsound} Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .",Project Manager,274
18,I didn't {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,275
18,But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker},User Interface,275
18,Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable .,Industrial Designer,276
18,Mm .,Industrial Designer,276
18,"But it's still too big I think , in your hand .",User Interface,277
18,Yeah .,User Interface,277
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,278
18,And would it even resemble fruit that way ?,Project Manager,278
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,279
18,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,280
18,"Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,",User Interface,281
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,282
18,like you could probably do a strawberry still .,User Interface,283
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,284
18,I think the broccoli would be out .,User Interface,285
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,286
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,287
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,288
18,"You could do {gap} , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like {disfmarker} sorta like a joystick .",User Interface,289
18,"Yeah that I I {disfmarker} when you were holding that before , it actually looked {disfmarker} yeah .",Project Manager,290
18,Yeah .,Marketing,291
18,That looked really good .,Marketing,291
18,I don't know .,User Interface,292
18,So {disfmarker},User Interface,292
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,293
18,"Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?",Marketing,294
18,Uh .,User Interface,295
18,Not that I can think of .,Industrial Designer,296
18,Rhubarb .,Industrial Designer,296
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,296
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,297
18,{vocalsound} Rhubarb .,User Interface,298
18,{vocalsound} I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .,Marketing,299
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,300
18,{vocalsound} These obscure fruits .,User Interface,301
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,302
18,Uh despite the {disfmarker},Marketing,303
18,{vocalsound} I think we needn't {disfmarker},User Interface,304
18,What if um the {disfmarker} it was just patterns on like {disfmarker} we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .,Project Manager,305
18,Huh ?,User Interface,306
18,You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .,Project Manager,307
18,Oh okay .,User Interface,308
18,"So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .",Industrial Designer,309
18,Yeah .,User Interface,310
18,That could work .,User Interface,310
18,Yeah .,Marketing,311
18,{gap},Marketing,311
18,Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Project Manager,312
18,Yeah .,User Interface,313
18,I mean {disfmarker},Project Manager,314
18,Yeah .,User Interface,315
18,I dunno .,User Interface,315
18,But if we if we need {disfmarker},Project Manager,316
18,Yeah and just have the colour match or something .,Marketing,317
18,yeah .,Project Manager,318
18,"And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be {disfmarker}",Project Manager,318
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,319
18,{vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker},Project Manager,320
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,321
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,322
18,Yeah .,User Interface,323
18,'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .,User Interface,323
18,Mm .,Project Manager,324
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,324
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,325
18,Mm .,Marketing,326
18,"Or like {disfmarker} I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think {disfmarker} see as like {disfmarker}",User Interface,327
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,328
18,"like you could {disfmarker} if it was only this {disfmarker} you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that .",User Interface,329
18,"But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .",User Interface,329
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,330
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,330
18,So like maybe that's just too big,User Interface,331
18,"Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,",Project Manager,332
18,because {disfmarker},User Interface,333
18,which is a nice kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,334
18,Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .,User Interface,335
18,Yeah .,Marketing,336
18,yeah .,Project Manager,337
18,But {disfmarker},Project Manager,337
18,{gap} I dunno .,User Interface,338
18,I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?,Project Manager,339
18,I guess {disfmarker},User Interface,340
18,'Cause like kind of {disfmarker},Project Manager,341
18,"We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .",Industrial Designer,342
18,"Yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,343
18,Yeah .,User Interface,344
18,Yeah .,Marketing,345
18,Or like even {disfmarker},Project Manager,346
18,Dif,User Interface,347
18,We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .,Industrial Designer,348
18,"Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that .",Project Manager,349
18,You know ?,Project Manager,349
18,Yeah .,User Interface,350
18,Yeah .,User Interface,350
18,Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .,User Interface,350
18,"'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .",Project Manager,351
18,Yeah .,User Interface,352
18,And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .,Project Manager,353
18,Mm-hmm .,Industrial Designer,354
18,Yeah .,Marketing,355
18,Mm .,User Interface,356
18,"And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .",Project Manager,357
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,358
18,Yeah .,User Interface,359
18,Yeah .,User Interface,359
18,Alright .,User Interface,359
18,But I mean it {disfmarker} do we have any other ideas about that ?,Project Manager,360
18,Um {disfmarker},Marketing,361
18,We could tr I don't know .,User Interface,362
18,Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one .,Marketing,363
18,{vocalsound} .,Marketing,363
18,"Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,",Marketing,363
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,364
18,which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .,Marketing,365
18,The batteries are going in the back ?,Project Manager,366
18,That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two .,Industrial Designer,367
18,Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .,Industrial Designer,367
18,No .,Marketing,368
18,The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker},Project Manager,369
18,"No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,",Industrial Designer,370
18,no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one .,Project Manager,371
18,Okay .,Project Manager,371
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,371
18,yeah um like on a normal remote .,Industrial Designer,372
18,Right .,Project Manager,373
18,"So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .",Industrial Designer,374
18,Okay .,Project Manager,375
18,I think everyone's under three anyway .,Marketing,376
18,Mm .,Project Manager,377
18,So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .,Marketing,378
18,Cool .,User Interface,379
18,Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .,User Interface,379
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,380
18,{vocalsound} Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .,Industrial Designer,381
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,382
18,Okay .,Project Manager,383
18,"Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff .",Industrial Designer,384
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,384
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,385
18,{vocalsound} We were a bit off task .,User Interface,386
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,387
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,388
18,Um so uh I can't think of any {disfmarker} So we'll have to like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm .,User Interface,389
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,390
18,Yeah I dunno .,User Interface,391
18,"You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,",User Interface,391
18,It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .,Industrial Designer,392
18,but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .,User Interface,393
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,394
18,"And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .",Project Manager,394
18,Yeah .,User Interface,395
18,Yeah that's true .,User Interface,395
18,Mm .,User Interface,395
18,I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .,Industrial Designer,396
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,397
18,Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .,Project Manager,397
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,398
18,Hmm .,User Interface,399
18,Mm .,Project Manager,400
18,"{vocalsound} Not really {disfmarker} Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation .",Project Manager,400
18,{vocalsound} Um so project evaluation .,Project Manager,400
18,Do you want this and we can all {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .,Marketing,401
18,"I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied {disfmarker} oh , oh it's alright .",Project Manager,402
18,Uh .,Project Manager,402
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,402
18,It's alright yeah ?,Marketing,403
18,Um {disfmarker} Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of {disfmarker},Project Manager,404
18,Sure .,Industrial Designer,405
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,406
18,I did .,User Interface,407
18,I mean fruit and squishiness .,Project Manager,408
18,How c more creative can you get ?,Project Manager,408
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,408
18,Yeah .,Marketing,409
18,{vocalsound} Sponginess .,Industrial Designer,410
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,410
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,411
18,The prototype making was very creatively stimulating,User Interface,412
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,413
18,and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria {vocalsound} .,User Interface,414
18,And how was our leadership and teamwork ?,Project Manager,415
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,415
18,I think it was good .,Industrial Designer,416
18,We knew what we were doing .,Industrial Designer,416
18,It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .,Industrial Designer,416
18,Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .,Project Manager,417
18,"{vocalsound} Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .",Industrial Designer,418
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,419
18,"{vocalsound} Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ?",Project Manager,420
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,420
18,{vocalsound} Um .,Project Manager,420
18,I think you were fine .,User Interface,421
18,"Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now .",Project Manager,422
18,You did a good job leading .,User Interface,423
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,424
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,425
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,426
18,"Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .",Project Manager,427
18,Yeah we didn't {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} uh it all c sort of blended quite well .,Marketing,428
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,429
18,"Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like {vocalsound} I don't know , all had ideas about it but {disfmarker}",User Interface,430
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,431
18,Very democratic .,Project Manager,431
18,"No spats , that was good .",Project Manager,431
18,{vocalsound} yeah .,User Interface,432
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,433
18,No .,User Interface,434
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,434
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,435
18,"{vocalsound} Um and the means for like {disfmarker} the materials we used , how convenient were they ?",Project Manager,436
18,"Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,",Project Manager,436
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,437
18,I mean we used {disfmarker},Project Manager,438
18,"Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .",Industrial Designer,439
18,Are you a Mac person ?,Project Manager,440
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,440
18,No no I never touch Macs either .,Industrial Designer,441
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,442
18,"I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .",Industrial Designer,443
18,Huh .,Project Manager,444
18,Hmm .,User Interface,445
18,Which isn't very user-friendly though .,Marketing,446
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,446
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,447
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,448
18,{vocalsound} Well the problem is if you don't {disfmarker} like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it .,Industrial Designer,448
18,So I have all these documents I can't use now .,Industrial Designer,448
18,But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .,Industrial Designer,448
18,"I felt like my {disfmarker} I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my {disfmarker} the information that was available to me was kind of just like {disfmarker} or maybe it was just the idea that we had .",User Interface,449
18,"But there's kinda {disfmarker} it was kinda like okay , I don't really think {disfmarker} I dunno what I'm doing here .",User Interface,449
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,450
18,Mm .,Project Manager,451
18,So I didn't really think it was helpful .,User Interface,452
18,"So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations ,",User Interface,452
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,453
18,so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .,User Interface,454
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,455
18,"But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , {vocalsound} think it's kinda stupid .",User Interface,456
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,457
18,I never use it .,Industrial Designer,457
18,Yeah but uh {disfmarker},User Interface,458
18,I can't say I found everything particularly helpful .,Project Manager,459
18,Like I {disfmarker},Project Manager,459
18,Yeah .,User Interface,460
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,461
18,It didn't really {disfmarker} yeah .,User Interface,462
18,It {disfmarker},Project Manager,463
18,My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .,Industrial Designer,464
18,I though it was brilliant no ?,Marketing,465
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,465
18,Really ?,Project Manager,466
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,466
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,467
18,No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .,Marketing,468
18,I mean m my problem {disfmarker},Project Manager,469
18,{vocalsound} Yeah it probably does .,Industrial Designer,470
18,So like a f,User Interface,471
18,I think it depends on the role,Marketing,472
18,"yeah , yeah .",Project Manager,473
18,Yeah I think so .,User Interface,474
18,no ?,Marketing,475
18,"'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like {disfmarker} they'd put {disfmarker} send you to sites and stuff right ?",Project Manager,476
18,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,477
18,"See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing .",Project Manager,478
18,And when you were talking about it I was just like {disfmarker},Project Manager,478
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,479
18,"you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things ,",Project Manager,480
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,481
18,'cause I {disfmarker},Project Manager,482
18,Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control .,Industrial Designer,483
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,484
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,484
18,As if you'd wanted to .,Industrial Designer,485
18,Yeah .,Marketing,486
18,But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um,Marketing,486
18,System .,Project Manager,487
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,487
18,"a whole system ,",Marketing,488
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,489
18,'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the {disfmarker},Marketing,490
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,491
18,"Yeah I mean , it {gap}",User Interface,492
18,"Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,493
18,"Yeah , yeah .",Marketing,494
18,"Yeah , huh .",Project Manager,495
18,It seems planned you know .,Industrial Designer,496
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,497
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,497
18,"Yeah I kinda thought that um {disfmarker} I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated",User Interface,498
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,499
18,because {disfmarker} {vocalsound},User Interface,500
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,501
18,I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time .,User Interface,502
18,But um {disfmarker},User Interface,502
18,Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like {disfmarker} we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?,Project Manager,503
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,504
18,Yeah .,User Interface,505
18,No .,Marketing,506
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,506
18,{vocalsound} So it's {disfmarker},Project Manager,507
18,If I hadn't been told that fruit was {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,508
18,But I think that {vocalsound} it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .,Marketing,509
18,Oh right .,Project Manager,510
18,given certain information or {disfmarker} Just {disfmarker},Project Manager,510
18,"Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input {disfmarker}",Marketing,511
18,yeah .,Project Manager,512
18,"I don't have a clue , anyway .",Marketing,513
18,"Mm , mm .",Project Manager,514
18,Um what's next ?,Marketing,515
18,Looks like {disfmarker} oh no that's not um {disfmarker},Marketing,515
18,What do you guys think of the pens ?,Project Manager,516
18,It's quite {disfmarker},Marketing,517
18,It asks about that .,Project Manager,518
18,They're pretty cool .,Industrial Designer,519
18,Mm .,Project Manager,520
18,I wanna s,User Interface,521
18,They're kinda hard to write with though .,Industrial Designer,522
18,Yeah,Project Manager,523
18,Yeah .,Marketing,524
18,and I I've f forgotten once or twice to {vocalsound} check the box .,Project Manager,525
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,525
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,526
18,I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the {disfmarker},User Interface,527
18,"They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write .",Industrial Designer,528
18,Mm .,Project Manager,529
18,"But even so , I dunno .",Industrial Designer,530
18,And new ideas found ?,Project Manager,531
18,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,532
18,"Yeah it's all very new ,",Marketing,533
18,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Project Manager,534
18,no ?,Marketing,535
18,It's all very new .,Marketing,535
18,Yeah I think I'd like to um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I dunno .,User Interface,536
18,Like it was {disfmarker} the {disfmarker},User Interface,536
18,Sorry .,Marketing,537
18,"I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're {disfmarker} like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like .",User Interface,538
18,Oh yeah .,Industrial Designer,539
18,Well they drop off if you like move too much .,Industrial Designer,539
18,Yeah I dunno .,User Interface,540
18,But they're they're okay .,User Interface,540
18,But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones .,Industrial Designer,541
18,Maybe we are .,Industrial Designer,541
18,Mm .,Project Manager,542
18,I don't know .,Industrial Designer,543
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,543
18,"{vocalsound} Uh I think , and I think that uh all this technology like {disfmarker} I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes ,",User Interface,544
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,545
18,"Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company ,",Industrial Designer,546
18,or like {disfmarker} I dunno .,User Interface,547
18,and I had a role and I had to go to meetings .,Industrial Designer,548
18,And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting .,Industrial Designer,548
18,Like usually I missed meetings deliberately .,Industrial Designer,548
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,549
18,"There's just {disfmarker} there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company .",Industrial Designer,550
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,551
18,It's mostly like rehashing old stuff .,Industrial Designer,552
18,Hm .,User Interface,553
18,And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know .,Industrial Designer,554
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,555
18,It's like the {disfmarker} there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .,Industrial Designer,556
18,Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration .,Project Manager,557
18,It seems like way overkill .,Industrial Designer,558
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,559
18,Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .,Industrial Designer,560
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,561
18,I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,562
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,563
18,"I guess it would be {disfmarker} it's gotta be worth it to {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno .",User Interface,564
18,How about a p {vocalsound} a {gap} {vocalsound} ?,User Interface,564
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,565
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,566
18,{vocalsound},Marketing,567
18,{vocalsound} Um I dunno .,User Interface,568
18,Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ?,Project Manager,569
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,569
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,570
18,Any other ideas for {disfmarker},Project Manager,571
18,What what's the end ?,Marketing,572
18,Are we are we supposed to um {disfmarker} you supposed to write a report ?,Marketing,572
18,Or we ending ?,Marketing,572
18,Um we still have time if there's any other input .,Project Manager,573
18,Is that the end ?,Marketing,574
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,575
18,"{vocalsound} I mean the {disfmarker} I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly .",Project Manager,576
18,"'Cause I mean we've all {disfmarker} we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy .",Project Manager,576
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,577
18,{gap},Marketing,578
18,Yeah .,User Interface,579
18,{vocalsound} So .,Project Manager,580
18,Um .,Project Manager,580
18,End of meeting .,Marketing,581
18,"You have to tell her , she {disfmarker}",Marketing,581
18,So I think that's all for today .,Project Manager,582
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,582
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,583
18,{vocalsound} Okay we have to fill in all this stuff .,Marketing,584
18,{vocalsound} M meeting adjourned .,User Interface,585
18,Stuff stuff stuff .,Marketing,586
18,Meeting adjourned .,Project Manager,587
18,Yeah .,Marketing,588
18,I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings .,Industrial Designer,589
18,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,589
18,Yeah .,Project Manager,590
18,{vocalsound},Project Manager,590
18,"{vocalsound} I think it would be a good idea , I like it .",User Interface,591
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,591
18,{vocalsound} It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention .,Industrial Designer,592
18,Especially if you have food .,Industrial Designer,592
18,So I guess we're supposed to write final reports .,Project Manager,593
18,'Cause {disfmarker},Project Manager,593
18,All of us ?,Industrial Designer,594
18,I don't know .,Project Manager,595
18,Hmm .,Project Manager,595
18,"Well there's al eight , nine .",Marketing,596
18,{vocalsound},User Interface,597
18,Ooh .,Marketing,598

19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,7
19,Crap .,Marketing,8
19,"{vocalsound} Sorry , {vocalsound} I I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}",Industrial Designer,9
19,Okay .,Marketing,10
19,It's perfect .,User Interface,11
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,11
19,{vocalsound} Your judgement it's {disfmarker} is biased .,Project Manager,12
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,12
19,I'm afraid {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype .,Industrial Designer,13
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,13
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,14
19,"'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ?",Marketing,15
19,"{vocalsound} So , we are {vocalsound}",Project Manager,16
19,Where ?,User Interface,17
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,17
19,{vocalsound},Marketing,18
19,It's here .,User Interface,19
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,19
19,So {vocalsound} let's go for our detailed design meeting .,Project Manager,20
19,Okay .,Industrial Designer,21
19,Yep .,Marketing,22
19,"So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan ,",Project Manager,23
19,Okay .,User Interface,24
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,25
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,25
19,Yeah .,User Interface,26
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,26
19,"{vocalsound} and our Industrial Designer , Baba .",Project Manager,27
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,28
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,28
19,"{vocalsound} So we'll have to evaluate the uh {disfmarker} your proposed remote control ,",Project Manager,29
19,'Kay .,User Interface,30
19,and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost .,Project Manager,31
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,31
19,{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,32
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,33
19,{vocalsound},Marketing,34
19,"{vocalsound} And in case if we're {disfmarker} we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production .",Project Manager,35
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,36
19,{vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker},Project Manager,37
19,I have slides .,User Interface,38
19,"You have s oh , sorry .",Project Manager,39
19,Okay .,Industrial Designer,40
19,Oops .,Project Manager,41
19,"Ah ,",User Interface,42
19,Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .,Industrial Designer,43
19,Product prod,User Interface,44
19,What slides ?,Marketing,45
19,Yep .,User Interface,46
19,Okay .,User Interface,46
19,Okay .,User Interface,46
19,"{vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype .",User Interface,46
19,This is made by clay .,User Interface,46
19,Looks strange .,Project Manager,47
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,47
19,Yeah .,User Interface,48
19,{vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red .,User Interface,48
19,"Yellow is uh our company colour ,",User Interface,48
19,Okay .,Project Manager,49
19,uh red it's uh is more attractive .,User Interface,50
19,"So we used two basic colour , yellow and red .",User Interface,50
19,"And the shape , there's two basic shape .",User Interface,50
19,The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .,User Interface,50
19,Okay .,Industrial Designer,51
19,It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design .,User Interface,52
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,53
19,"It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .",User Interface,54
19,{vocalsound},Marketing,55
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,56
19,Uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,56
19,So this is a introduction of our product .,User Interface,57
19,"{vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but",Project Manager,58
19,Next a mo,User Interface,59
19,Yeah .,Marketing,60
19,"{vocalsound} Okay ,",User Interface,61
19,{vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking .,Project Manager,62
19,"yeah , so next slide .",User Interface,63
19,So there are several key features of our pr prototype .,User Interface,63
19,The first is that it is fuzzy .,User Interface,63
19,I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .,User Interface,63
19,{vocalsound} Oh .,Project Manager,64
19,"{vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,65
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,65
19,"Maybe , I hope so .",Project Manager,66
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,66
19,"{vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .",User Interface,67
19,"Yeah , that's true .",Industrial Designer,68
19,"Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection .",User Interface,69
19,"In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel .",User Interface,69
19,Chan,Project Manager,70
19,So it's quite convenient for user to use it .,User Interface,71
19,"Yeah , okay , but don't touch {disfmarker} don't destroy your prototype .",Project Manager,72
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,72
19,"Yeah , s {vocalsound}",User Interface,73
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,74
19,okay .,User Interface,75
19,Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base .,User Interface,75
19,"Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it .",User Interface,75
19,"So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button .",User Interface,75
19,"You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}",User Interface,75
19,Everything's mushroom .,Project Manager,76
19,So we can call our remote control the mushroom .,Project Manager,76
19,Yeah {gap} .,Industrial Designer,77
19,"Yeah , everything's mushroom .",User Interface,78
19,"Mush Mushroom design , yeah .",User Interface,78
19,"Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh {vocalsound} like lemon shape , you know , centre {vocalsound} is yellow and t d",Industrial Designer,79
19,Yeah,User Interface,80
19,Okay .,Project Manager,81
19,"Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .",User Interface,82
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,82
19,"To integrate , you know {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer,83
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,84
19,"I don't think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I hope nobody will eat it {gap} You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} in",Industrial Designer,85
19,Oh .,Project Manager,86
19,Yeah,User Interface,87
19,"Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends .",Marketing,88
19,I mean there was fruits {disfmarker} yeah .,Marketing,88
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,88
19,Fruits and vegetables .,Project Manager,89
19,Really ?,Industrial Designer,90
19,"But {disfmarker} Fruit and vegetable ,",Industrial Designer,90
19,Vegetables .,Project Manager,91
19,Mushroom is a vegetable .,Project Manager,91
19,so mushroom was a kind of you know {gap} uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,92
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,User Interface,93
19,I don't think it is .,Marketing,94
19,It's vegetable .,Project Manager,95
19,Mushroom ?,Industrial Designer,96
19,Yeah .,User Interface,97
19,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,98
19,"Oh , uh I'm not sure .",Industrial Designer,99
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,99
19,So th it's something eatable .,Project Manager,100
19,"We can {disfmarker} it's a veg a kind of vegetable ,",Industrial Designer,101
19,Yeah .,Marketing,102
19,but you know we we integrated them with different colour .,Industrial Designer,103
19,Yeah .,User Interface,104
19,"But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .",Marketing,105
19,Yeah .,User Interface,106
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,106
19,{disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable {gap} you know .,Industrial Designer,107
19,"This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .",Industrial Designer,107
19,"No , I mean , yeah {vocalsound} yeah .",Marketing,108
19,Inspira inspiration is {disfmarker},Marketing,108
19,And inspired colour,Industrial Designer,109
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,110
19,"and {vocalsound} and very sophisticated material , so .",Industrial Designer,111
19,True .,Marketing,112
19,And so {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,113
19,Yeah .,User Interface,114
19,Next slide .,Project Manager,115
19,"Uh , no this our only two slides .",User Interface,116
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,116
19,{gap},Project Manager,117
19,"So what we w what I can add is that , you know {vocalsound} he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip ,",Industrial Designer,118
19,Yeah .,User Interface,119
19,"it is a low level chip , and {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,120
19,So we cut it to see .,User Interface,121
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,121
19,"You know , we don't need to k {vocalsound} .",Industrial Designer,122
19,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,123
19,You know wi {vocalsound} the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i,Industrial Designer,124
19,Okay .,User Interface,125
19,So where's the battery battery ?,User Interface,125
19,The battery it is under {gap} .,Industrial Designer,126
19,In the base .,Project Manager,127
19,"It is in th in {disfmarker} in the base , yeah .",Industrial Designer,128
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,128
19,In the basement .,Project Manager,129
19,In the basement .,Project Manager,129
19,Base .,User Interface,130
19,Here ?,User Interface,130
19,And where is the solar solar cell ?,Project Manager,131
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,132
19,But we say uh we sa we said solar .,Marketing,133
19,Where is the solar cell ?,Project Manager,134
19,In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,135
19,Oh .,Project Manager,136
19,Do you think it won't be {disfmarker} It won't cris increase the price ?,Project Manager,136
19,Okay,User Interface,137
19,{vocalsound},Marketing,138
19,"{vocalsound} {gap} I don't think so ,",Industrial Designer,139
19,"Okay , we'll see after .",Project Manager,140
19,"{vocalsound} but it it's might be okay , so .",Industrial Designer,141
19,We will have first to {disfmarker},Project Manager,142
19,I it might be okay .,Industrial Designer,143
19,So {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,143
19,"so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?",Project Manager,144
19,Yeah .,Marketing,145
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,146
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,147
19,"I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about {disfmarker} uh",Marketing,148
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,149
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,150
19,"we had three keys {disfmarker} {vocalsound} key points to uh for this remote control design ,",Marketing,151
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,152
19,and first one was uh,Marketing,153
19,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,154
19,fancy look and feel .,Marketing,155
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,156
19,Yeah .,User Interface,157
19,"So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think .",Marketing,158
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,159
19,Uh just let me check .,Marketing,160
19,"So , four point {disfmarker} three point five , it means it's acceptable .",Industrial Designer,161
19,"One one being true , and seven being false .",Marketing,162
19,Okay .,Marketing,162
19,Oops .,Industrial Designer,163
19,Ouch .,Marketing,164
19,So,Marketing,164
19,Okay .,User Interface,165
19,"Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?",Marketing,166
19,"Yeah , I think so .",User Interface,167
19,I think you have nice colours .,Industrial Designer,168
19,{vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,168
19,But is it {disfmarker},Marketing,169
19,The sha the bowl shape people like .,Industrial Designer,170
19,"Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour {disfmarker}",User Interface,171
19,"Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really {disfmarker}",Marketing,172
19,{vocalsound} Is it really fancy ?,Industrial Designer,173
19,{vocalsound} So it depend on how d do you define fancy .,User Interface,174
19,"Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .",Marketing,175
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,176
19,But it's {disfmarker} you have the lemon aspect of this th this {vocalsound} this thing .,Industrial Designer,177
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,177
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Marketing,178
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,179
19,"Maybe if you change {disfmarker} if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that {disfmarker}",Project Manager,180
19,"{vocalsound} Do Don't do that , please .",Industrial Designer,181
19,"I dunno where the lemon is , but",Marketing,182
19,"{vocalsound} I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,183
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,184
19,I mean it's not obvious .,Marketing,185
19,It would be bet more like a lemon ?,Project Manager,186
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,187
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,188
19,If {disfmarker},Marketing,189
19,Because i,Industrial Designer,190
19,"I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or {disfmarker}",Marketing,191
19,Yeah .,Project Manager,192
19,Less button .,Industrial Designer,193
19,"Uh so , my mush {disfmarker} .",User Interface,194
19,{gap},Industrial Designer,195
19,Looks like more fruit .,Project Manager,196
19,Maybe a pineapple ?,Project Manager,196
19,"Yeah , but you don't have any button now .",Industrial Designer,197
19,Mm .,User Interface,198
19,Yeah .,Marketing,199
19,I dunno .,Marketing,199
19,"And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ?",Project Manager,200
19,Yeah .,User Interface,201
19,"That's uh yeah , is that {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,202
19,Hmm .,User Interface,203
19,that's a good idea .,Industrial Designer,204
19,"Yeah , it's getting {disfmarker}",Marketing,205
19,It looks {vocalsound} more like a pineapple .,Project Manager,206
19,So that's great .,Industrial Designer,207
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,207
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,208
19,{vocalsound},Marketing,209
19,Sorry .,Project Manager,210
19,That's great .,Industrial Designer,211
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,211
19,What's the use for that ?,Project Manager,212
19,"I have no idea , so .",Industrial Designer,213
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,213
19,"Uh , for turn turn the ball .",User Interface,214
19,"If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .",User Interface,214
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,215
19,I have no idea {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,216
19,{vocalsound} {vocalsound} And where is the voice recognition ?,Project Manager,217
19,Okay .,Marketing,218
19,Uh .,User Interface,219
19,"Ah , it's embedded , your microphone .",User Interface,219
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,220
19,Okay .,Project Manager,221
19,Th this th th there's two two functions .,User Interface,222
19,"Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Wait th that's the second point .",Marketing,223
19,This is microphone array {disfmarker},User Interface,224
19,First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .,Marketing,225
19,If it is fancy or not .,Industrial Designer,226
19,Okay .,Project Manager,227
19,Is it better like that ?,Project Manager,227
19,I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Marketing,228
19,"Looks {disfmarker} okay ,",Project Manager,229
19,So we can we can say t,Industrial Designer,230
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,231
19,let's say it's a pineapple now .,Project Manager,232
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,232
19,"The colour , is the colour acceptable ?",Industrial Designer,233
19,"{vocalsound} No , the colour is okay , that's fine .",Marketing,234
19,So the shape now .,Industrial Designer,235
19,I mean it's {disfmarker},Marketing,236
19,It looks like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker},Project Manager,237
19,but I would say there is more {disfmarker} too much red .,Marketing,238
19,now you took it .,Project Manager,239
19,It's too much red ?,Industrial Designer,240
19,Um if,Marketing,241
19,In the basement ?,Industrial Designer,242
19,It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top .,Project Manager,243
19,{vocalsound} Okay .,User Interface,244
19,{vocalsound} Right .,Marketing,245
19,"So , from one to seven ?",Marketing,245
19,{vocalsound} I will give {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,246
19,{vocalsound} Mm uh {disfmarker} Seven is the ma the maximum ?,Project Manager,247
19,I'll gi,Industrial Designer,248
19,"No , seven is false and one is true .",Marketing,249
19,I'll give two or three .,Industrial Designer,250
19,"Three , I will say three .",Project Manager,251
19,"Three , it's okay .",Industrial Designer,252
19,"Three , three .",Industrial Designer,252
19,Three is fine for me .,Industrial Designer,252
19,Three ?,Marketing,253
19,'Kay,User Interface,254
19,Okay .,Marketing,255
19,Isn't it bitter like that {gap} ?,Project Manager,256
19,Three .,Marketing,257
19,Yeah yeah yeah .,User Interface,258
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,258
19,Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker},Marketing,259
19,What other {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,260
19,The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .,Marketing,261
19,Is it easy to use ?,Industrial Designer,262
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,262
19,Feasible ?,Project Manager,263
19,{vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an,Project Manager,263
19,Ye uh {disfmarker} Embedded .,Industrial Designer,264
19,"Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact .",User Interface,265
19,"It's a micro array , okay .",Industrial Designer,266
19,There four microphone .,User Interface,267
19,Oh .,Project Manager,268
19,"Okay ,",Project Manager,268
19,So they they they they {disfmarker} there's a microphone array .,User Interface,269
19,and you have the {disfmarker} there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?,Project Manager,270
19,"Yeah , yeah .",User Interface,271
19,And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?,Project Manager,272
19,"So you can capture voice {disfmarker} yeah , you c",User Interface,273
19,"Oh yeah , yeah .",Industrial Designer,274
19,"Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions .",User Interface,275
19,Yeah .,User Interface,275
19,"And I think you {disfmarker} you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is {disfmarker} I",Industrial Designer,276
19,"Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .",Marketing,277
19,"{vocalsound} W Yeah , but {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,278
19,We have tactile buttons .,Project Manager,279
19,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,280
19,"I see , you have microphone array embedded .",Industrial Designer,281
19,You have {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,281
19,"No , that's good .",Marketing,282
19,Yeah .,Marketing,282
19,That's good .,Industrial Designer,283
19,"Oh , yeah .",Project Manager,284
19,"Yeah , th that's another really good point .",Marketing,285
19,Maybe {disfmarker} okay .,Marketing,285
19,"I think technically it's acceptable , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,286
19,Maybe two ?,Project Manager,287
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,288
19,"So using the same scale , two ?",Marketing,289
19,Two ?,Project Manager,290
19,I would say two,Project Manager,290
19,"Two , yeah , two .",Industrial Designer,291
19,"It's it's fine , so .",Industrial Designer,291
19,.,Project Manager,292
19,You agree ?,Project Manager,292
19,"Yeah , I agree .",User Interface,293
19,Okay .,Marketing,294
19,"It's better like that , isn't it ?",Project Manager,295
19,{vocalsound} {vocalsound},User Interface,296
19,Now maybe the most critical one .,Marketing,297
19,Okay .,Project Manager,298
19,{vocalsound} Most {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,299
19,{vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ?,Marketing,300
19,"Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy .",Industrial Designer,301
19,But it's just speaking .,Industrial Designer,301
19,"Yeah , it's very easy .",User Interface,302
19,You just need the command .,Industrial Designer,303
19,You can use this in this way .,User Interface,304
19,Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker},Marketing,305
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,306
19,As a principle .,Industrial Designer,307
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,307
19,Yeah .,User Interface,308
19,{vocalsound} Please .,Marketing,309
19,Th this is the base .,User Interface,310
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,311
19,So you can turn to change the channel .,User Interface,312
19,Yeah .,Marketing,313
19,Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?,Marketing,313
19,You just tu turn d d,User Interface,314
19,I think maybe if you he,Industrial Designer,315
19,"Oh , ok I understand .",Project Manager,316
19,Like if you want to go from {disfmarker},Marketing,317
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,318
19,"You take take {vocalsound} the remote , so {disfmarker}",Project Manager,319
19,If you hear some click {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,320
19,and you can turn like that to change the channel ?,Project Manager,321
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,321
19,Yeah .,User Interface,322
19,Yeah .,User Interface,322
19,Yeah but imagine you y,Marketing,323
19,"I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast .",Project Manager,324
19,{vocalsound},Project Manager,324
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,325
19,"Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?",Marketing,326
19,"Oh yeah , that's difficult .",Industrial Designer,327
19,That's dif that's difficult .,Industrial Designer,327
19,Yeah .,User Interface,328
19,"How can you go directly to twenty , for example ?",Marketing,329
19,{vocalsound},Marketing,329
19,"No , no , no .",User Interface,330
19,I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker},User Interface,330
19,Yeah .,Marketing,331
19,it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker},User Interface,332
19,Yeah .,Marketing,333
19,I agree .,Marketing,333
19,I agree .,Marketing,333
19,Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,334
19,But I mean if you're fro from two ?,Marketing,335
19,I if if this is a channel one .,User Interface,336
19,"So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .",User Interface,336
19,I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,337
19,"Yeah , you have a {vocalsound} , like that , and so on .",Project Manager,338
19,So change .,User Interface,339
19,Yeah .,User Interface,339
19,And you you can {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,340
19,Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker},Marketing,341
19,Oh yeah .,Project Manager,342
19,Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree .,User Interface,343
19,We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah .,Marketing,344
19,So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker},User Interface,345
19,Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker},Project Manager,346
19,"I think you can if you have a scale , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,347
19,"No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn ,",User Interface,348
19,Mm-hmm .,Project Manager,349
19,then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker},User Interface,350
19,Yeah .,Marketing,351
19,How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?,Marketing,351
19,"It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker}",User Interface,352
19,"So you you count {gap} one degree , two degrees , no .",Marketing,353
19,"Yeah , yeah , yeah .",User Interface,354
19,You can do it .,User Interface,354
19,I don't think so .,Marketing,355
19,{vocalsound},Marketing,355
19,"{vocalsound} Yeah , it's a bit difficult .",Industrial Designer,356
19,I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it .,User Interface,357
19,"{vocalsound} I think so , you can just change .",User Interface,357
19,I think b but the the vocal command is easy too .,Industrial Designer,358
19,"You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,358
19,Yeah voc vocal command is okay .,Marketing,359
19,But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker},Marketing,359
19,"There's uh also a number , you know .",User Interface,360
19,"Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels .",Project Manager,361
19,"So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .",Project Manager,361
19,"Uh , yeah , and y that's {disfmarker} yeah .",Industrial Designer,362
19,"But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it .",Project Manager,363
19,"And this would be more for browsing , ah .",Marketing,364
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,365
19,Yeah .,Marketing,366
19,Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?,Project Manager,367
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,368
19,To see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,368
19,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,369
19,yeah {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,370
19,Yeah .,User Interface,371
19,Yeah .,User Interface,371
19,Yeah .,Industrial Designer,372
19,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,373

19,"And also you can , if you i",User Interface,382
19,"{gap} yeah , what's what's this cherry ?",Project Manager,383
19,You ca you can turn this .,User Interface,384
19,Or you ca you can you can also turn this .,User Interface,384
19,"It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .",Industrial Designer,385
19,For this you can tune it's for tune .,User Interface,386
19,"You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this .",User Interface,386
19,If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this .,User Interface,386
19,{vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,387
19,"It's like fine , from coarse to fine .",User Interface,388
19,Mm .,Marketing,389
19,"This is coarse , this is fine .",User Interface,390
19,"Yeah , yeah yeah .",Industrial Designer,391
19,That's,Industrial Designer,391
19,Okay .,Project Manager,392
19,So it's coarse to fine design .,User Interface,393
19,"that's very technologic , so .",Industrial Designer,394
19,{vocalsound} Yeah .,Industrial Designer,394
19,Yeah .,User Interface,395
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,395
19,Okay the uh th this looks better .,Marketing,396
19,Yeah .,Marketing,396
19,"Yeah is is {disfmarker} this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel .",User Interface,397
19,S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates,Industrial Designer,398
19,This is from one channel to {disfmarker},User Interface,399
19,maybe one of the {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,400
19,Yeah .,User Interface,401
19,Yeah .,User Interface,401
19,"Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .",Project Manager,402
19,Uh it's k {gap},Industrial Designer,403

19,"Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .",Marketing,412
19,That's true .,Project Manager,413

19,"So , which number ?",Marketing,419
19,{disfmarker} three .,Project Manager,420
19,"{vocalsound} Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three .",Industrial Designer,421
19,{vocalsound},Industrial Designer,421
19,Do you agree ?,Project Manager,422
19,Mm-hmm .,User Interface,423
19,Three ?,Project Manager,424
19,"Yeah , agree , agree .",User Interface,425
19,"So reasonably , is four , is one ?",Marketing,426
19,"Three f three for me , it's o it's okay .",Industrial Designer,427
19,"So , three .",Marketing,428
19,{gap},User Interface,429
19,{vocalsound} Four or three .,Industrial Designer,430
19,Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean .,Industrial Designer,430
19,{vocalsound},User Interface,431
19,And what's your opinion ?,Project Manager,432
19,Will you give four ?,Industrial Designer,433
19,"Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .",Marketing,434
19,Five ?,Industrial Designer,435
19,"Yeah , so maybe if {disfmarker}",Industrial Designer,435
19,Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ?,User Interface,436
19,Yeah .,Marketing,437
19,I think it's easier than traditional controller .,User Interface,438
19,"If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have {disfmarker} you just turn the turn the ball .",User Interface,438
19,Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker},Industrial Designer,439
19,"There's two kind of balls ,",User Interface,440
19,So you have {disfmarker},Marketing,441
19,the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale .,User Interface,442
19,{vocalsound} yeah .,Marketing,443
19,"But in the traditional controller , how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale ?",User Interface,444
19,Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .,Marketing,445
19,"You just push two button , zero and and one .",Industrial Designer,446
19,"Yeah ,",User Interface,447
19,And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,448
19,"yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .",User Interface,449
19,Yeah .,Marketing,450
19,Are there some buttons ?,Industrial Designer,451
19,Okay .,Industrial Designer,451
19,"Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one .",User Interface,452
19,It's not what you said previously .,Project Manager,453
19,Mm-hmm .,Marketing,454

19,"Yeah , if you're changing your mind .",Marketing,456
19,{gap},Industrial Designer,457
19,Fine to coarse .,Marketing,458

19,You can just {disfmarker},User Interface,469
19,You can {disfmarker} {vocalsound},Industrial Designer,470
19,Yeah .,User Interface,471

19,Just {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker},Marketing,477
19,It's just your turning from the base .,Project Manager,478
19,You need to have everything in hand .,Project Manager,478
